{"cik": "855874", "company": "COMMUNITY FINANCIAL CORP /MD/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nCredit Risks\nOur increased emphasis on commercial lending may expose us to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, our loan portfolio included $964.8 million, or 66.3%, and $878.0 million, or 65.2%, respectively, of commercial real estate loans, $123.6 million, or 8.5%, and $124.3 million, or 9.2%, respectively, of residential rental loans, $63.1 million, or 4.3% and $71.7 million, or 5.3%, respectively of commercial business loans and $63.6 million, or 4.4% and $50.2 million, or 3.7%, respectively, of commercial equipment loans. We intend to maintain our emphasis on these types of loans. These types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss and require a commensurately higher loan loss allowance than owner-occupied one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Commercial business and equipment loans expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayments from the cash flows of the borrower\u2019s business and are secured by non-real estate collateral that may depreciate over time. Also, many of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, $16.6 million, or 92.8% and $17.8 million, or 92.1%, respectively, of our non-accrual loans of $17.9 million and $19.3 million, respectively, consisted of commercial loans.\nImposition of limits by the bank regulators on commercial real estate lending activities could curtail the Company\u2019s growth and adversely affect its earnings.\nIn 2006, the federal banking regulators issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices,\u201d referred to herein as the CRE Guidance. Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure could receive increased supervisory inquiry where total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. Additionally, in December 2015, the federal banking regulators released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending, referred to herein as the 2015 Statement. In the 2015 Statement, the federal banking regulators, among other things, indicate the intent to continue \u201cto pay special attention\u201d to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. Taking into account this guidance, if the FDIC, the Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator, were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans the Bank can hold in its portfolio, for reasons noted above or otherwise, the Company\u2019s earnings could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2019, the Bank\u2019s total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans represented 319.98% of the Bank\u2019s total risk-based capital. Management has established a CRE lending framework to monitor specific exposures and limits by types within the CRE portfolio and takes appropriate actions, as necessary.\nWe may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge-off additional loans in the future. Further, our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.1 million and $1.4 million, respectively. We also recorded net loan charge-offs of $2.2 million and $944,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our non-accrual loans, OREO and accruing TDRs aggregated $26.3 million, or 1.46% of total assets and $34.1 million, or 2.02% of total assets, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Additionally, loans that were classified as special mention and substandard were $26.9 million and $32.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019 and 2018. We had no loans classified as doubtful or loss at December 31, 2019 and 2018. If the economy and/or the real estate market weakens, more of our classified loans may become non-performing and we may be required to take additional provisions to increase our allowance for loan losses for these assets as the value of the collateral may be insufficient to pay any remaining net loan balance, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations. We maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb\nprobable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date. However, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nIn evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, we consider numerous factors, including our historical charge-off experience, growth of our loan portfolio, changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent, non-accrual and classified loans, TDRs and foreclosed real estate. In addition, we use information about specific borrower situations, including their financial position and estimated collateral values, to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers. Finally, we also consider other qualitative factors, including general and economic business conditions, anticipated duration of the current business cycle, current general market collateral valuations, and trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account. Our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers\u2019 abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments, competitive challenges and other factors. Because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, our actual losses may vary from our current estimates.\nOur regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, as required by our regulators, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not effectively manage our credit risk, we may experience increased levels of non-performing loans, charge-offs and delinquencies, which would require additional increases in our provision for loan losses.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of non-payment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt and risks resulting from changes in economic and market conditions. Our credit risk approval and monitoring procedures may not reduce these credit risks, and they cannot be expected to completely eliminate our credit risks. If the overall economic climate in the United States, generally, or our market areas, specifically, fails to improve, or even if it does improve, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, and the level of non-performing loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for loan losses, which would cause our net income and return on equity to decrease.\nNon-performing and classified assets could take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could result in further losses in the future.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, our non-accrual loans totaled $17.9 million, or 1.23% of our loan portfolio and $19.3 million, or 1.43% of our loan portfolio, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our non-accrual loans, OREO and accruing TDRs totaled $26.3 million, or 1.46% of total assets and $34.1 million, or 2.02% of total assets, respectively. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not accrue interest income on non-accrual loans or foreclosed properties, thereby adversely affecting our net income and returns on assets and equity, increasing our loan administration costs and adversely affecting our efficiency ratio. When we take collateral in foreclosure and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its fair market value less estimated selling costs, which may result in a loss. These non-performing loans and foreclosed properties also increase our risk profile and the amount of capital our regulators believe is appropriate to maintain in light of such risks. The resolution of non-performing assets requires significant time commitments from management and can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. If we experience increases in non-performing loans and non-performing assets, our net interest income will be negatively impacted, and our loan administration costs could increase, each of which could have an adverse effect on our net income and related ratios, such as return on assets and equity.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018 our total classified assets were $34.6 million and $40.8 million, respectively. While we continue to accrue interest income on classified loans that are performing, classified loans and other classified assets may negatively impact profitability by requiring additional management attention and regular monitoring. Increased monitoring of these assets by management may impact our management\u2019s ability to focus on opportunistic growth, potentially adversely impacting future profitability.\nOur residential mortgage loans and home equity loans expose us to a risk of loss due to declining real estate values.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, $167.7 million, or 11.5%, of our total loan portfolio, and $156.7 million, or 11.6%, of our total loan portfolio, respectively, consisted of owner-occupied one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, $36.1 million, or 2.5%, of our total loan portfolio and $35.6 million, or 2.6%, of our total loan portfolio, respectively, consisted of home equity loans and lines of credit. Declines in the housing market could result in declines in real estate values in our market area. A decline in real estate values could cause some of our mortgage and home equity loans to be inadequately\ncollateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nOur asset valuation may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flows and other financial modeling techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value some of our assets if trading becomes less frequent and market data becomes less observable. There may be asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. In such cases, asset valuation may require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation.\nIf the value of real estate in our market area were to decline, a significant portion of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nDeclines in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans. A decline in property values would diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral, making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. Additionally, a decrease in asset quality could require additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses, which would hurt our profits. Real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions, including, among other things, changes in general or regional economic conditions, governmental rules or policies and natural disasters.\nWe may be adversely affected by economic conditions in our market area, which is significantly dependent on federal government and military employment and programs.\nOur marketplace is primarily in the counties of Charles, Calvert, St. Mary\u2019s and Anne Arundel, Maryland and neighboring communities, and the Fredericksburg area of Virginia. Many, if not most, of our customers live and/or work in those counties or in the greater Washington, DC metropolitan area. Because our services are concentrated in this market, we are affected by the general economic conditions in the greater Washington, DC area. Changes in the economy may influence the growth rate of our loans and deposits, the quality of the loan portfolio and loan and deposit pricing. A significant decline in economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could decrease the demand for banking products and services generally and/or impair the ability of existing borrowers to repay their loans, which could negatively affect our financial condition and performance.\nA significant portion of the population in our market area is affiliated with or employed by the federal government or at military facilities located in the area which contribute to the local economy. As a result, a reduction in federal government or military employment or programs could have a negative impact on local economic conditions and real estate collateral values and could also negatively affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nLiquidity Risk\nOur deposit concentrations may subject us to additional liquidity and pricing risk.\nSignificant variations in deposit concentrations and pricing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We manage portfolio diversification through our asset/liability committee process. We occasionally accept larger deposit customers, and our typical deposit customers might occasionally carry larger balances. The aggregate amount of our top 25 deposit relationships have grown from $347.4 million, or 20.6%, of our total assets at December 31, 2018 to $503.3 million, or 28.0% of our total assets at December 31, 2019. The FDIC\u2019s examination policies require that the Company monitor all customer deposit concentrations at or above 2% of total deposits. At December 31, 2019, the Bank had two local municipal customer deposit relationships that exceeded 2% of total deposits, totaling $297.1 million which represented 19.6% of total deposits of $1,511.8 million. At December 31, 2018, there was one municipal customer\ndeposit relationship that exceeded 2% of total deposits, totaling $158.8 million which represented 11.1% of total deposits of $1,429.6 million.\nThe Bank's asset and liability management process closely monitors municipal deposit concentrations. However, unanticipated significant changes in these large balances could affect our liquidity risk and pricing risk. While we reduced our reliance on wholesale funding during the year ended December 31, 2019, the withdrawal of more municipal deposits than we anticipate could have an adverse impact on our profitability as this source of funding, if not replaced by similarly priced deposit funding, would need to be replaced with wholesale funding, the sale of interest-earning assets, or a combination of the two. The replacement of municipal deposit funding with wholesale funding could cause our overall cost of funds to increase, which would reduce our net interest income and results of operations. A decline in interest-earning assets would also lower our net interest income and results of operations.\nThe Company is a bank holding company and its sources of funds necessary to meet its obligations are limited.\nThe Company is a bank holding company, and its operations are primarily conducted by the Bank, which is subject to significant federal and state regulation. Cash available to pay dividends to our common and preferred stockholders, pay our obligations and meet our debt service requirements is derived from dividends received from the Bank. Future dividend payments by the Bank to us will require generation of future earnings by the Bank and are subject to certain regulatory guidelines. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not have the resources or cash flow to pay or meet all of our obligations.\nOperational Risk\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d). Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business, or changes in applicable accounting rules. Sarbanes-Oxley requires our management to evaluate the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Matters impacting our internal control over financial reporting may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us by, for example, leading to a decline in our stock price and impairing our ability to raise capital. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve their independence from us. If our auditors were found not to be \u201cindependent\u201d of us under SEC rules, we could be required to engage new auditors and re-file financial statements and audit reports with the SEC. In that case, we could be out of compliance with SEC rules until new financial statements and audit reports were filed, limiting our ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse consequences.\nOur internal control systems are inherently limited.\nOur systems of internal controls, disclosure controls and corporate governance policies and procedures are inherently limited. The inherent limitations of our system of internal controls include the use of judgment in decision-making that can be faulty; breakdowns can occur because of human error or mistakes; and controls can be circumvented by individual acts or by collusion of two or more people. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitation of a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, any plans of remediation for any identified limitations may be ineffective in improving our internal controls.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as core data processing systems, internet, mobile applications, connections, network access and fund distribution. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we cannot control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those which result from their failure to provide services for any reason or their poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise to conduct its business. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, we provide our customers with the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet, mobile applications and the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Despite instituted safeguards and monitoring, our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, physical and cyber security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to a variety of operational risks, environmental, legal and compliance risks, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer, telecommunications systems, cyber security breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the Internet or other users. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions of other entities, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by the Bank can also result in negative public opinion about our other businesses.\nIf personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be misappropriated, mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, erroneously providing such information to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or the interception or inappropriate acquisition of such information by third parties.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters, disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets) which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and to the risk that our (or our vendors\u2019) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in our diminished ability to operate our business (for example, by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect), as well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage\nand regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, perhaps materially.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners; and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Information security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile applications, and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. Despite our security measures and monitoring, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in significant costs to us, which may include fines and penalties, potential liabilities from governmental or third party investigations, proceedings or litigation, legal, forensic and consulting fees and expenses, costs and diversion of management attention required for investigation and remediation actions, and the negative impact on our reputation and loss of confidence of our customers and others, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, revenues, financial condition and competitive position. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses.\nIf our information technology is unable to keep pace with industry developments, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nExiting or entering new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk.\nFrom time to time, we may exit an existing line of business or implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. When exiting a line of business or product we may have difficulty replacing the revenue stream and may have to take certain actions to make up for the line of business or product. For example, we recently discontinued the origination of residential mortgage loans and instead now purchase residential mortgage loans for our loan portfolio from other sources. If those sources are not available or the cost for such purchases increases our results of operations may be adversely affected. We also may face increased credit risk with respect to purchased loans relative to the credit risks we faced in connection with the origination of loans. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nChanges in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings.\nOur largest component of earnings is net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Changing interest rates impact customer actions and may limit the options available to the Company to maximize earnings or increase the costs to minimize risk. We do not have control over market interest rates and the Company\u2019s focus to mitigate potential earnings risk centers on controlling the composition of our assets and liabilities.\nOur net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investments less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest margin and, as a result, our net interest income. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to increase or decrease. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up. Changes in the slope of the \u201cyield curve\u201d- or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates-could also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or inverts, we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. Our procedures for managing exposure to falling net interest income involve modeling possible scenarios of interest rate increases and decreases to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect: (1) our ability to originate loans; (2) the value of our interest-earning assets; (3) our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and (4) the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, particularly adjustable or variable rate loans.\nThe Company may be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future.\nThe Company has certain loans, investment securities and debt obligations whose interest rate is indexed to the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which is responsible for regulating LIBOR, has announced that the publication of LIBOR is not guaranteed beyond 2021 and it appears highly likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what reference rate or rates or benchmarks may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, although the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (a group of private-market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as the recommend alternative to LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the adoption, market acceptance or availability of SOFR or other alternative reference rates, may adversely affect the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities in the Company\u2019s portfolio and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. The language in the Company\u2019s LIBOR-based contracts and financial instruments has developed over time and may have various events that trigger when a successor index to LIBOR would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments may give the Company or the calculation agent, as applicable, discretion over the selection of the substitute index for the calculation of interest rates. The implementation of a substitute index for the calculation of interest rates under the Company\u2019s loan agreements may result in the Company incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company continues to develop and implement plans to mitigate the risks associated with the expected discontinuation of LIBOR. In particular, the Company has implemented or is in the process of implementing fallback language for LIBOR-linked loans.\nStrategic and Other Risks\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to timely and effectively execute our strategic plan or manage the growth called for in our strategic plan. We have grown through our January 1, 2018 acquisition of County First Bank and may continue to grow through other acquisitions. To be successful as a larger institution, we must successfully integrate the operations and retain the customers of acquired institutions, attract and retain the management required to successfully manage larger operations, and control costs.\nAmong other things, our strategic plan currently calls for reducing the amount of our non-performing assets, growing assets through commercial lending and generating transaction deposit accounts to reduce our funding costs and improve our net interest margin. Our ability to increase profitability in accordance with this plan will depend on a variety of factors including the identification of desirable business opportunities, competitive responses from financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage liquidity and funding sources. While we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our strategic plan, opportunities may not be available and that the strategic plan may not be successful or effectively managed.\nIn implementing our strategic plan, we may expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets through opportunistic acquisitions of whole banks or branch locations. On January 1, 2018, we acquired County First Bank. Future results of operations will be impacted by our ability to successfully integrate the operations of County First Bank and any other acquired institutions and retain the customers of those institutions. If we are unable to successfully manage the integration of the separate cultures, customer bases and operating systems of the acquired institutions, and any other institutions\nthat may be acquired in the future, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. To the extent that we undertake additional acquisitions, we are likely to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations during the integration period, which may have an adverse effect on our levels of reported net income, return on average equity and return on average assets. In addition, if we undertake substantial growth, we may need to increase non-interest expenses through additional personnel, occupancy expense and data processing costs, among others. In order to successfully manage growth, we may need to adopt and effectively implement policies, procedures and controls to maintain credit quality, control costs and oversee operations. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in this strategy. Other effects of engaging in such growth strategies may include potential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention and general disruption to our business. We may not be able to adequately, timely and profitably achieve the intended benefits or our growth strategies or manage anticipated growth.\nFinally, substantial growth may stress regulatory capital levels, and may require us to raise additional capital. No assurance can be given that we will be able to raise any required capital, or that it will be able to raise capital on terms that are beneficial to stockholders.\nStrong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nWe face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our competition for loans and deposits includes banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies, credit unions and non-banking financial institutions. We compete with regional and national financial institutions that have a substantial presence in our market area, many of which have greater liquidity, higher lending limits, greater access to capital, more established market recognition and more resources and collective experience than us. Furthermore, tax-exempt credit unions operate in our market area and aggressively price their products and services to a large portion of the market. This competition may make it more difficult for us to originate new loans and may force us to offer higher deposit rates than we currently offer. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in lower interest rates earned on our loans and higher interest rates paid on our deposits, which would reduce net interest income. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Financial Statements\nChanges in accounting standards or interpretation of new or existing standards may affect how the Company reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change accounting regulations and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, the FASB, SEC, bank regulators and the outside independent auditors may revise their previous interpretations regarding existing accounting regulations and the application of these accounting standards. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how to record and report the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, there could be a requirement to apply a new or revised accounting standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nThe implementation of a new accounting standard could require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nFASB has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company\u2019s first fiscal year after December 15, 2022 unless the Company chooses early adoption. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and provide for the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which the Company expects could require it to increase its allowance for loan losses and will likely increase the data the Company would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, include a number of provisions that could continue to have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single family residential and multi-family residential real estate. Included in this legislation was a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, other changes included: lower limits on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single family residential mortgages; the elimination of interest deductions for home equity loans; a limitation on deductibility of business interest expense; and a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes. Such changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, single family residential properties and multifamily residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future. In addition, these changes may have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high\nresidential home prices and high state and local taxes. If home ownership or multifamily residential property ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans would decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in the Company\u2019s portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership and multifamily residential ownership, which could require an increase in the Company\u2019s provision for expected credit losses. Additionally, certain borrowers could become less able to service their debts as a result of higher tax obligations. These changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $13.0 million. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities may be subject to refinement as additional information relative to closing date fair values becomes available and may result in adjustments to goodwill within the first 12 months following the closing date of the acquisition. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. A significant decline in expected future cash flows, a material change in interest rates, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant or sustained decline in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting estimates, and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe processes that the Company uses to estimate its expected credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on its financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models that the Company uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Company may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models that the Company uses for determining its expected credit losses are inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models that the Company uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Company could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in the Company\u2019s analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal and Compliance Risk\nOur enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which we are subject, based upon the size, scope, and complexity of the Company.\nAs a financial institution, we are subject to a number of risks, including interest rate, credit, liquidity, legal/compliance, market, strategic, operational, and reputational. Our enterprise risk management (\u201cERM\u201d) framework is designed to minimize the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diverse set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated.\nFor example, economic and market conditions, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, and increases in the overall complexity of our operations, among other developments, have resulted in the creation of a variety of risks that were previously unknown and unanticipated, highlighting the intrinsic limitations of our risk monitoring and mitigation techniques. As a result, the further development of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, an ineffective ERM framework, as well as other risk factors, could result in a material increase in our FDIC insurance premiums.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination as noted in the \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d section of this report. The regulation and supervision by the Maryland Commissioner, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC are not intended to protect the interests of investors in The Community Financial Corporation common stock. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including changes in the ownership or control\nof banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital and sound financial condition, permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments, permissible nonbanking activities, the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on dividend payments. These and other restrictions limit the manner in which the Company may conduct business and obtain financing. The laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to the Company and the Bank are subject to regular modification and change. Such changes may, among other things, increase the cost of doing business, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer, or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations. The burdens imposed by federal and state regulations put banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies, and leasing companies.\nWe are periodically subject to examination and scrutiny by a number of banking agencies and, depending upon the findings and determinations of these agencies, we may be required to make adjustments to our business that could adversely affect us.\nFederal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency was to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset concentration, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk or other aspects of any of our operations has become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management is in violation of any law or regulation, it could take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to change the asset composition of our portfolio or balance sheet, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nNegative developments in the financial industry, the domestic and international credit markets, and the economy in general pose significant challenges for our industry and us and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative developments that began in the latter half of 2007 and that have continued since then in the global credit and securitization markets have resulted in unprecedented volatility and disruption in the financial markets, a general economic downturn and a tepid economic recovery, both nationally and in our primary markets. As a result, commercial as well as consumer loan portfolio performances deteriorated at many institutions and have not fully recovered, and the competition for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly. In addition, the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline. As a result, we may face the following risks:\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions that negatively affect housing prices and the job market may cause the credit quality of our loan portfolios to deteriorate;\n\u2022\nMarket developments that affect consumer confidence may cause adverse changes in payment patterns by our customers, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities;\n\u2022\nThe processes that we use to estimate our allowance for loan losses and reserves may no longer be reliable because they rely on judgments, such as forecasts of economic conditions, that may no longer be capable of accurate estimation;\n\u2022\nThe value of our securities portfolio may decline; and\n\u2022\nWe face increased regulation of our industry, and the costs of compliance with such regulation may increase.\nThese conditions or similar ones may continue to persist or worsen, causing us to experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. In recent years, various significant economic and monetary stimulus measures were implemented by the U.S. Congress and the Federal Reserve pursued a highly accommodative monetary policy aimed at keeping interest rates at historically low levels. U.S. economic activity has significantly improved, but there can be no assurance that this progress will continue or will not reverse.\nAn important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Maryland law, as well as state and federal banking regulations, could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Maryland corporate law could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our shareholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions include: supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that shareholders may act on at shareholder meetings. In addition, we are subject to Maryland laws, including one that prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested shareholder for a period of five years from the date the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \u201cPATRIOT Act\u201d) and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nThe Company is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA requires the Federal Reserve to assess the Bank\u2019s performance in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. If the Federal Reserve determines that the Bank needs to improve its performance or is in substantial non-compliance with CRA requirements, various adverse regulatory consequences may ensue. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Act to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of federal consumer financial laws with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider, identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive\u201d in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The ongoing broad rulemaking powers of the CFPB have potential to have a significant impact on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services.\nA successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA, fair lending laws or regulations, or consumer lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines.\nPrivate parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket Risk\nThe market price and liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if the economy were to weaken or the capital markets were to experience volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to changes in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects. Among other factors, these risks may be affected by:\n\u2022\nOperating results that vary from the expectations of our management or of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nDevelopments in our business or in the financial services sector generally;\n\u2022\nRegulatory or legislative changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations;\n\u2022\nOperating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nChanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or rating agencies;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions, dispositions, financings, and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nChanges or volatility in global financial markets and economies, general market conditions, interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit, or asset valuations; and\n\u2022\nSignificant fluctuations in the capital markets.\nEconomic or market turmoil could occur in the near or long term, which could negatively affect our business, our financial condition, and our results of operations, as well as volatility in the price and trading volume of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.\nOn December 31, 2019, the Company entered into subscription agreements with various purchasers under which it issued a total of 312,747 shares of its common stock in a private placement offering. In order to maintain our capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, or to fund future growth, our board of directors may decide from time to time to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of our common stock. The sale of these shares may significantly dilute your ownership interest as a shareholder. New investors in the future may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our current shareholders which may adversely impact our current shareholders.\nReputational Risk\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 14175, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TCFC"}
