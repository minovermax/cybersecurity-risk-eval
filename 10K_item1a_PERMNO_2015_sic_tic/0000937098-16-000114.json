{"cik": "937098", "company": "TRINET GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this report, including the section of this report titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur co-employment relationship with our worksite employees exposes us to business risks.\nUnder our agreements with our clients, we are a co-employer of our WSEs and assume certain obligations, including the responsibility to pay salaries, wages and related payroll taxes of our WSEs, and to do so, to the extent required by law, regardless of whether our client timely remits payments to us. In addition, we provide benefits to our WSEs, even if the cost of providing such benefits is greater than fees received from our clients. Although our client agreements require clients to pay these amounts or indemnify us for failure to make such payments, we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect on these contractual obligations. Accordingly, our ultimate liability for payroll and benefits expenses for our WSEs could exceed the amounts we receive from our clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nMoreover, as a co-employer of our WSEs, there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment laws and other acts and omissions by our clients or WSEs, who may be deemed to be our agents, even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations. Such laws include, but are not limited to, laws relating to payment of wages, employment discrimination, labor relations and whistleblower protection. Although our client agreements establish the contractual division of responsibilities between us and our clients for various personnel management matters, including compliance with and liability under various governmental regulations, as well as providing for clients to indemnify us for any liability attributable to clients\u2019 or their employees\u2019 conduct, we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect on these contractual obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe maintain employment practices liability insurance coverage (often including coverage for our clients) to manage our and our clients\u2019 exposure for various WSE-related claims and are responsible (often together with our clients) for any deductible layer under such coverage. Furthermore, employment practices liability insurance generally excludes coverage for claims relating to compliance with laws associated with the classification of employees as exempt or non-exempt, such as overtime pay and minimum wage law compliance. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us and for which we are unable to obtain indemnification from our clients. If judgments or settlements or defense costs exceed our insurance coverage, it could harm our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain appropriate types and levels of insurance in the future, that we will be able to replace existing policies on acceptable terms, or at all, or that our insurers will be able to pay all claims that we may make under our policies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is subject to numerous state and federal laws, and uncertainty as to the application of these laws, or adverse applications of these laws, as well as changes in applicable laws, could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are governed by numerous federal, state and local laws relating to labor, tax, employee benefits, insurance and employment matters. However, many of these laws (such as ERISA and federal and state employment tax laws) do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of a professional employer organization providing outsourced HR services in a co-employment relationship, and the definition of employer under these laws is not uniform. In addition, many states have not addressed the co-employment relationship for purposes of compliance with applicable state laws governing the relationship between employers and employees and state insurance laws. We are not able to predict whether broader federal or state regulation governing our business and the co-employment relationship with our WSEs will be implemented, or if it is, how it will affect us, our clients or our WSEs. Any adverse application or interpretation (in courts, agencies or otherwise) of new or existing federal or state laws to the co-employment relationship with our clients and WSEs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If federal, state or local jurisdictions were to change their regulatory framework related to outsourced HR services, or introduce new laws governing our industry that were materially different from existing laws, those changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services, or could require that we make significant changes in our methods of doing business, which could increase our cost of doing business. Changes in regulations could also affect the extent and type of employee benefits employers can or must provide employees, the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay or the time within which employers must remit taxes to the applicable authority. These changes could substantially decrease our revenues and substantially increase our cost of doing business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough some states do not explicitly regulate professional employer organizations, 42 states have passed laws that have licensing, certification or registration requirements applicable to professional employer organizations or recognize the professional employer organization model, and other states may implement such requirements in the future. Laws regulating professional employer organizations vary from state to state, but generally provide for oversight of the fiscal responsibility of professional employer organizations, and in some cases codify and clarify the co-employment relationship for processing unemployment claims, workers compensation and other purposes under state law. We may be required to spend significant time and resources to satisfy licensing requirements or other applicable regulations in some states, and we may not be able to satisfy these requirements or regulations in all states, which could prohibit us from doing business in such states, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not recognized as an employer of worksite employees under federal and state regulations, or are deemed to be an insurance agent or third-party administrator, we and our clients could be adversely impacted.\nIn order for WSEs to receive the full benefit of our employee benefits plan offerings, it is important that we act and qualify as an employer of the WSEs for certain purposes under the Code and ERISA. In addition, our status as an employer is important for purposes of ERISA\u2019s preemption of certain state laws. The definition of employer under various laws is not uniform, and under both the Code and ERISA, the term is defined in part by complex multi-factor tests. We believe that we\nqualify as an employer of our WSEs in the United States for the relevant purpose of both the Code and ERISA, and we implement processes to protect and preserve this status. With passage of the Small Business Efficiency Act in December 2014, the U.S. Congress clarified the employer status of professional employer organizations or PEOs for federal tax purposes under the Code for those PEOs who voluntarily become certified under this law. The IRS is expected to begin accepting applications for certification under the Code in July 2016 and we currently intend to apply for certification. However, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued guidance that certain entities in the HR outsourcing industry may not qualify as employers for ERISA purposes. If we were found not to be an employer under the Code or ERISA, it could affect the manner in which we are able to provide employee benefits to our WSEs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, state regulatory authorities generally require licenses for companies that do business in their states as insurance agents or third-party administrators, such as those that handle health or retirement plan funding and claim processing. Insurance and third-party administrator regulation covers a host of activities, including sales, underwriting, rating, claims payments and record keeping by companies and agents. We do not believe that our services constitute acting as an insurance agent or third-party administrator. If regulatory authorities in any state determine that the nature of our business requires that we be licensed as an insurance agent or as a third-party administrator, we may need to hire additional personnel to manage regulatory compliance and become obligated to pay annual regulatory fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our clients could be adversely impacted by health care reform.\nThe Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, proposes sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2020, and many provisions of the ACA require the issuance of additional guidance from the U.S. Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, the IRS and the states. A number of key provisions of the ACA have begun to take effect over the past several years, including the establishment of state and federal insurance exchanges, insurance market reforms, \u201cplay or pay\u201d penalties on applicable large employers and the imposition and assessment of excise taxes and reinsurance taxes on insurers and third-party administrators. Collectively, these items have the potential to significantly change the insurance marketplace for employers and how employers offer or provide insurance to employees.\nAs a co-employer of our clients\u2019 WSEs, we assume or share certain employer-related responsibilities and legal risks and assist our clients in complying with many employment-related governmental regulations. Generally, the ACA and subsequently issued guidance by the IRS and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have not addressed, or in some instances are unclear, as to their application in the co-employment relationship. In future periods, the changes may result in increased costs to us and our clients and could affect our ability to attract and retain clients. Additionally, we may be limited or delayed in our ability to increase service fees to offset any associated potential increased costs resulting from compliance with the ACA. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding the terms and application of the ACA may delay or inhibit the decisions of potential clients to outsource their HR needs. Any of these developments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to offer competitive health and/or workers compensation insurance rates could harm our business.\nIf we are unable to offer competitive health and/or workers compensation insurance rates to our clients, it could affect our ability to attract and retain clients, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, where we offer our clients and their WSEs group health insurance policies with respect to which our carriers set the premiums and for which we are not responsible for any deductible, the rates set by our carriers on such policies may not be competitive. Further, for policies with respect to which we agree to pay additional amounts to our carriers for any claims that they pay within an agreed-upon deductible layer, we may not be able to control costs through the deductible layer in a way that would make our rates competitive. In addition, broad adoption of our services in certain geographies or industries may make it more difficult for us to obtain competitive health and/or workers compensation insurance rates due to concentration of clients within a particular geography or industry. The inability to offer competitive insurance rates, for the above reasons or any other, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnexpected changes in workers compensation and health insurance claims by worksite employees could harm our business.\nWe maintain health and workers compensation insurance covering our WSEs. Our insurance costs are impacted significantly by our WSEs\u2019 health and workers compensation insurance claims experience. We establish reserves to provide for the estimated costs of reimbursing our workers compensation and health insurance carriers for paying claims within the deductible layer in accordance with their insurance policies. Estimating these reserves involves our consideration of a number\nof factors and requires significant judgment. If there is an unexpected increase in the severity or frequency of claims activity of our WSEs (including activity arising from any of a number of factors that affect claim activity levels, such as changes in general economic conditions, claims differing significantly from expectations for new and existing clients, proposed and enacted regulatory changes, and terrorism, disease outbreaks or other catastrophic events ), or if we subsequently receive updated information indicating insurance claims were higher than previously estimated and reported, our insurance costs could be higher in that period or subsequent periods as we adjust our reserves accordingly. We have also experienced variability in the amount of our insurance costs due to the number and severity of insurance claims being unpredictable. For example, in the three months ended June 30, 2015, we experienced a significant increase in the number of large medical claims, which resulted in a significant increase in insurance costs. In addition, we may be unable to increase our pricing to offset increases in insurance costs either in full or on a timely basis. Incorporating cost increases into what we charge our clients could also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain clients. The occurrence of any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse changes in our relationships with key vendors, particularly our employee benefit carriers, could harm our business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to establish and maintain arrangements and relationships with vendors that supply us with essential components of our services. These service providers include insurance carriers to provide health and workers compensation insurance coverage for WSEs, as well as other vendors such as couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their WSEs. Failure by these service providers, for any reason, to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations, impact client relations, and result in significant penalties or other liabilities to us. If any of these vendors decide to terminate its relationship with us, particularly our employee benefit carriers, we may have difficulty obtaining replacement services at reasonable rates or on a timely basis, if at all. The loss of any one or more of our key vendors, or our inability to partner with certain vendors that are better-known or more desirable to our clients or potential clients, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches could result in the improper disclosure of sensitive company, employee, client and WSE data, including personal information, exposing us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nOur ability to ensure secure electronic processing, maintenance and transmission of payroll, insurance and other sensitive employee, client and WSE information is critical to our operations. This information could include sensitive or confidential data, such as employees\u2019 Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, retirement account information and medical information.\nWe rely on standard internet and other security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. Despite our security measures, it is possible that our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, including attacks by hackers and other malfeasance. Third parties, including vendors that provide services for our operations, could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. Any such security breach could compromise our networks and result in the information stored or transmitted there to be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings leading to liability, including under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to our clients and WSEs, damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, operations and competitive position. In the course of providing our services to our clients, we also rely on certain third-party service providers and products, such as insurance carriers, to process information related to our employees, clients and WSEs. Through contractual provisions, we take steps to require that our service providers protect sensitive information. However, we cannot provide assurances as to the security steps taken by such providers. Any security breach or other disruption of our third-party service providers that results in an inadvertent disclosure or loss of confidential information could adversely affect our reputation and our business.\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nOur quarterly results of operations are likely to fluctuate, and our results in some quarters may be below the expectations of research analysts and our investors, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Some of our significant expenses, such as insurance costs for our WSEs, may require significant lead time to offset or reduce. If we do not achieve our expected revenues targets, we may be unable to adjust our costs quickly enough to offset any revenues shortfall, which could\nharm our results of operations. Some of the important factors that have and may cause our revenues, results of operations and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u2022\nthe number and severity of health and workers compensation insurance claims by WSEs and the timing of claims information provided by our insurance carriers;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our insurance costs, operating expenses and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe number of our new clients initiating service and the number of WSEs employed by each new client;\n\u2022\nthe loss of existing clients;\n\u2022\nreduction in the number of WSEs employed by existing clients;\n\u2022\nthe timing of client payments and payment defaults by clients;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our acquisitions of companies, assets and technologies;\n\u2022\npayments or drawdowns on our credit facility, or any amendments to our obligations under our credit facility;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;\n\u2022\nexpenses we incur for geographic and service expansion;\n\u2022\nour regulatory compliance costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in our effective tax rate; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements.\nMany of the above factors are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and in the section of this report titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Many of these factors are outside our control, and the variability and unpredictability of these factors have in the past and could in the future cause us to fail to meet our expectations for revenues or results of operations for a given period. In addition, the occurrence of one or more of these factors might cause our results of operations to vary widely, which could lead to negative impacts on our margins, short-term liquidity or ability to retain or attract key personnel, and could cause other unanticipated issues. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, results of operations and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nVolatility in the financial and economic environment could harm our business.\nDemand for our services is sensitive to changes in the level of overall economic activity in the markets in which we operate. During periods of weak economic conditions, employment levels tend to decrease, small business failures tend to increase and interest rates may become more volatile. Current or potential clients may also react to weak economic conditions or forecasted weak economic conditions by reducing their employee headcount or by lowering their wage, bonus or benefits levels, any of which would affect our revenues, and may affect our margins, because we may be unable to reduce our operating expenses sufficient to offset the drop in revenues. It is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction, strength and length of economic cycles. These conditions may affect the willingness of our clients and potential clients to pay outside vendors for services like ours, and may impact their ability to pay their obligations to us on time, or at all. In addition, if businesses have difficulty obtaining credit, business growth and new business formation may be impaired, which could also harm our business. Even modest downturns in economic activity or the availability of credit on a regional or national level could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nMost of our clients are concentrated in certain geographies and a relatively small number of industries, making us vulnerable to downturns in those geographies and industries.\nMost of our clients are concentrated in certain geographies and operate in a relatively small number of industries, including the technology, life sciences, not-for-profit, professional services, financial services, real estate, retail, manufacturing, and hospitality industries. As a result, if any of those geographic regions or specific industries suffers a downturn, the portion of our business attributable to clients in that region or industry could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business and operations have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we are unable to effectively manage this growth, our business and results of operations may suffer.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and have significantly expanded our operations in recent periods, which has placed a strain on our management and our administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Managing this growth requires us to further refine our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures.\nOur ability to effectively manage any significant growth of our business will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to do the following:\n\u2022\neffectively recruit, integrate, train and motivate new employees, while retaining our existing employees, maintaining the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture and effectively executing our business plan;\n\u2022\nsatisfy our existing clients and identify and acquire new clients;\n\u2022\nenhance the breadth and quality of our services;\n\u2022\ncontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls; and\n\u2022\nmake sound business decisions in light of the scrutiny associated with operating as a public company.\nThese activities will require significant operating and capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources, and we expect that our growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and on our operational and financial infrastructure.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to execute on our business plan will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in an efficient or timely manner, or at all. In particular, any failure to successfully implement systems enhancements and improvements will likely negatively impact our ability to manage our expected growth, ensure uninterrupted operation of key business systems and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to public companies. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our costs and expenses may increase more than we expect them to, which in turn could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to sustain our profitability or revenue growth rate in the future.\nWhile we have achieved profitability on an annual basis in each of the last four fiscal years, we have not consistently achieved profitability on a quarterly basis during that same period. Our operating expenses could increase substantially in the near term, particularly as we continue to invest in our sales and marketing organization, expand our operations and improve our infrastructure and enhance the breadth and quality of our services. If our revenues do not increase to offset these increases in our operating expenses, we may not be profitable in future periods.\nMoreover, you should not consider our historical revenue growth rate to be indicative of our future performance. As we grow our business, our revenue growth rates may slow in future periods due to a number of reasons, which may include slowing demand for our services, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities, the maturation of our business or the decline in the number of SMBs in our target markets and verticals.\nIf our vertical sales strategy is unsuccessful or if our sales force is otherwise unable to sell our solutions at the rate that we anticipate, we may not be able to maintain our client base or grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have aligned our business based on an industry vertical approach where our sales force, product development, and service teams are increasingly focused on specific business sectors. Our vertical approach gives us an understanding of the HR needs facing SMBs in those industries. This knowledge enables us to provide a bundled solution of services that is tailored to its specific needs of clients in these industries. If our vertical strategy is unsuccessful, our business may not grow at the rate that we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to raise awareness of the benefits of our services and identify and acquire new clients, we have rapidly grown our direct sales force. Competition for skilled sales personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting, training and retaining qualified sales personnel, or that our newly hired sales personnel will function effectively, either individually or as a group. In addition, our newly hired sales personnel are typically not productive for up to a year following their hiring. This results in increased near-term costs to us relative to the sales contributions of these newly hired sales personnel. If we are unable to effectively train our sales force and benefit from greater productivity of our sales\nrepresentatives, or if our sales force is otherwise unable to sell our solutions as we anticipate, our revenues likely will not increase at the rate that we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or improve our results of operations.\nWe face significant competition on a national and regional level from a number of companies purporting to deliver a range of bundled services that are generally similar to the services we provide, including large professional employer organizations such as the TotalSource business unit of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Insperity, Inc., as well as specialized and small professional employer organization service providers. If and to the extent that we and other companies providing these services are successful, we anticipate that future competitors will enter this industry. Some of our current, and any future, competitors have or may have greater marketing and financial resources than we have, and may be better positioned than we are in certain markets. Increased competition in our industry could result in price reductions or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business. We expect that we will continue to experience competitive pricing pressure. If we cannot compete effectively, our market share, business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nIn addition to competition from other professional employer organizations, we also face significant competition in the form of companies serving their HR needs in both traditional and non-traditional manners. These forms of competition include:\n\u2022\nHR and information systems departments and personnel of companies that perform their own administration of employee benefits, payroll and HR;\n\u2022\nproviders of certain endpoint HR services, including payroll, employee benefits and business process outsourcers with high-volume transaction and administrative capabilities, such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Paychex, Inc. and other third-party administrators;\n\u2022\nemployee benefit exchanges that provide benefits administration services over the Internet to companies that otherwise maintain their own employee benefit plans; and\n\u2022\ninsurance brokers who allow third party HR systems to integrate with their platform.\nWe believe that our services are attractive to many SMBs in part because of our ability to provide workers compensation, health care and other benefits programs to them on a cost-effective basis. We compete with insurance brokers and other providers of this coverage in this regard, and our offerings must be priced competitively with those provided by these competitors in order for us to attract and retain our clients.\nWe may not be successful in convincing potential clients that the use of our services is a superior, cost-effective means of satisfying their HR obligations relative to the way in which they currently satisfy these obligations.\nIf we cannot compete effectively against other professional employer organizations or against the alternative means by which companies meet their HR obligations, or if we are unable to convince clients or potential clients of the advantages of our offerings, our market share and business may suffer, resulting in a material , adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to maintain or enhance our reputation or brand identity could harm our business.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation and the TriNet brand identity is critical to maintaining our relationships with our clients and vendors and our ability to attract new clients and vendors. We also believe that our reputation and brand identity will become more important as competition in our industry continues to develop. Our ability to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand identity will be affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain new sales personnel to expand our direct sales force;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain our existing clients and attract new clients;\n\u2022\nthe quality and perceived value of our services;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nactions of our competitors and other third parties;\n\u2022\npositive or negative publicity about us or our industry in general;\n\u2022\ntimeliness of our filings with the SEC,\n\u2022\ninterruptions, delays or attacks on our platform or mobile applications; and\n\u2022\nlitigation or regulatory developments.\nAny brand promotion activities in which we engage may not be successful or yield increased revenues. Furthermore, negative publicity, whether or not justified, relating to events or activities attributed to us, our corporate employees, our WSEs, our vendors, other companies in our industry or others associated with any of these parties, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand identity may reduce demand for our services and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand may be costly and time-consuming, and any such efforts may not ultimately be successful.\nWe are subject to client attrition.\nWe regularly experience significant client attrition due to a variety of factors, including cost, client merger and acquisition activity, increases in administrative fees and insurance costs, client business failure, effects of competition and clients deciding to bring their HR administration in-house. Our standard client service agreement can be cancelled by us or by the client without penalty with 30 days\u2019 prior written notice. Clients who intend to cease doing business with us often elect to do so effective as of the beginning of a calendar year. As a result, we have historically experienced our largest concentration of client attrition in the first quarter of each year. In addition, we experience higher levels of client attrition in connection with renewals of the health insurance we provide for WSEs in the event that such renewals result in increased premiums that we pass on to our clients. If we were to experience client attrition in excess of our projected annual attrition rate of approximately 20% of our installed WSE base, which occurred most recently in 2011, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisition strategy creates risks for our business.\nWe have completed numerous acquisitions of other businesses and technologies, and we expect that we will continue to grow through acquisitions of other businesses, assets or technologies. We may fail to identify attractive acquisition candidates or we may be unable to reach acceptable terms for future acquisitions. If we are unable to complete acquisitions in the future, our ability to grow our business will be impaired.\nAcquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating the operations, systems, technologies, services and personnel of the acquired companies, including the migration of WSEs from an acquired company\u2019s technology platform to ours;\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with establishing or maintaining internal controls, procedures and policies relating to the acquired systems and processes, including the potential for actual or perceived control weaknesses associated with or arising from the acquisitions and integration of acquired systems;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nover-valuation by us of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nlitigation resulting from activities of the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, clients, former stockholders and other third parties;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisitions and unanticipated liabilities of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ninsufficient indemnification or security from the selling parties for legal liabilities that we may assume in connection with our acquisitions;\n\u2022\nentering markets in which we have no prior experience and may not succeed;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with foreign acquisitions, such as communication and integration problems resulting from geographic dispersion and language and cultural differences, compliance with foreign laws and regulations and general economic or political conditions in other countries or regions;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; and\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with clients and employees of the acquired companies or our clients and employees as a result of the integration of acquired operations and new management personnel.\nIf we fail to integrate newly acquired businesses effectively, we might not achieve the growth, service enhancement or operational efficiency objectives of the acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may pay for acquisitions by issuing additional shares of our common stock, which would dilute our stockholders, or by issuing debt, which could include terms that restrict our ability to operate our business or pursue other opportunities and subject us to meaningful debt service obligations. We may also use significant amounts of cash to complete acquisitions. To the extent that we complete acquisitions in the future, we likely will incur future depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the acquired assets. We may also record significant amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill, which could become impaired in the future. Any such impairment charges would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nSignificant judgments and estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows may be impacted if any of our tax positions are challenged and successfully disputed by the tax authorities. In determining the adequacy of our tax provision, we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes that could result if our tax positions were challenged by the IRS and other tax authorities. The tax authorities in the United States regularly examine our income and other tax returns. For example, in connection with an IRS examination of prior federal income tax returns filed by Gevity, a company we acquired in 2009, we received a technical advice memorandum from the IRS taking the position that a total of $10.1 million employment tax credits taken by Gevity, and an additional approximately $2.3 million taken by us after acquiring Gevity, should be reversed, which position we dispute. The ultimate outcome of these examinations and tax disputes cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of these or other examinations, we may be required to record charges to operations that could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our operating flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $499.6 million in outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility, all of which was secured indebtedness of our subsidiary, TriNet HR Corporation, guaranteed on a senior secured basis by us and certain of our subsidiaries. Our level of indebtedness and the limitations imposed on us by our credit facility could affect our business in various ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe will have to use a portion of our cash flows from operating activities for debt service rather than for other operational activities;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to borrow additional funds or obtain additional financing for future working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures or other corporate purposes, or may have to pay more for such financing;\n\u2022\nsome or all of the indebtedness under our current or future credit facilities bears interest at variable interest rates, making us more vulnerable to interest rate increases;\n\u2022\nwe could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions as a result of our inability to reduce our debt service costs in response to reduced revenues.\nBecause borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at a variable rate, our interest expense could increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, exacerbating these risks. Our ability to meet these expenses depends on our future business performance, which will be affected by various factors, including the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We are not able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors. Our operations may provide insufficient cash to pay the principal and interest on our credit facility and to meet our other debt obligations. If so, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing indebtedness or borrow additional funds, which we may not be able to do on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict our ability to take some or all of these responsive actions. If we were unable to pay the principal and interest on our credit facility or meet our other debt obligations, the lenders under our credit facility could\nterminate their commitments to extend further credit to us and accelerate a substantial part of our indebtedness. If that were to happen, we may not be able to repay all of the amounts that would become due under our indebtedness or refinance our debt. If we were unable to repay those amounts or refinance our debt, the lenders under our credit facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If that were to happen, our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed and we might be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.\nThe terms of our credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, which would impair our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our business.\nOur credit facility contains, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restricting our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur, assume or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nincur or assume liens;\n\u2022\nmake loans, investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nengage in sales of assets and subsidiary stock;\n\u2022\nenter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncomplete dividends, loans or asset transfers from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business;\n\u2022\nprepay other indebtedness;\n\u2022\ntransfer all or substantially all of our assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions with another person; and\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures.\nUnder the credit facility, we are required to comply with a financial covenant that requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a maximum leverage ratio so long as there is any indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility (excluding letters of credit issued and outstanding of up to $15.0 million other than letters of credit that have been cash collateralized). Our ability to meet the leverage ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to comply with it. Our failure to comply with this financial covenant or other restrictive covenants under our credit facility and other debt instruments could result in a default under our credit facility and/or other debt instruments, which in turn could result in the termination of the lenders\u2019 commitments to extend further credit to us under our credit facility and acceleration of a substantial portion of our indebtedness then outstanding under our credit facility. If that were to happen, we may not be able to repay all of the amounts that would become due under our indebtedness or refinance our debt. If we were unable to repay those amounts or refinance our debt, the lenders under our credit facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If that were to happen, our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed and we might be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel or fail to attract additional skilled personnel, our business may suffer.\nOur operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our officers and executive management and the performance and productivity of our regional managers and field personnel. Our ability to attract and retain business depends on the quality of our services and the relationships that we maintain with our clients. If we lose key personnel with significant experience in managing our business, this could impair our ability to deliver services effectively or profitably, could divert other senior management time in seeking replacements, and could adversely affect our reputation with our clients and potential clients. Some of our most important client relationships depend on the continued involvement of individual managers or sales personnel, and any loss of those individuals could jeopardize those relationships and in turn adversely affect our operating results.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain highly skilled technical, sales and marketing and support personnel, particularly with expertise in outsourced solutions and the technology platforms that we deploy today and will deploy in the future. Our failure to attract and retain the appropriate personnel may limit the rate at which we can expand our business, including developing new services and attracting new clients, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, we have identified material weaknesses relating to our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2015 due to material weaknesses. Specifically, we identified material weaknesses relating to (i) ineffective information technology general controls, primarily with respect to computer operations, access controls and change management, (ii) ineffective control environment and risk assessment, (iii) ineffective management review controls and controls over system-generated reports, (iv) ineffective controls over payroll operations, (v) ineffective controls over health and workers compensation liabilities and related expenses, (vi) ineffective controls over validating accuracy of payroll tax liabilities, and (vii) ineffective authorization controls over procurement processes. However, giving full consideration to these weaknesses, and the additional analyses and other procedures we performed to ensure that our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with GAAP. While the material weaknesses described above create a reasonable possibility that an error in financial reporting may go undetected, after extensive review and the performance of additional analysis and other procedures, no material adjustments, restatement or other revisions to our previously issued financial statements were required.\nAs further described in Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d below, we are taking specific steps to remediate the material weaknesses that we identified; however, the material weaknesses will not be remediated until the necessary controls have been implemented and we have determined the controls to be operating effectively. Because the reliability of the internal control process requires repeatable execution, the successful remediation of these material weaknesses will require review and evidence of effectiveness prior to concluding that the controls are effective. In addition, we may need to take additional measures to address the material weaknesses or modify the remediation steps, and we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls will be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that the identified material weaknesses will not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees and require material cost to implement new process or modify our existing processes. Moreover, other material weaknesses or deficiencies may develop or be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, lead to delisting, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, privacy, data protection or law enforcement matters, tax matters, labor and employment claims, commercial claims, purported class action lawsuits, and other matters. For example, we are a party to a putative securities class action lawsuit filed by a purported stockholder of our company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in liability, penalties, or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, or requiring a change in our business practices, products or technologies, which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. See Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below for additional information about the legal proceedings we are currently involved in and future proceedings that we may face.\nOur failure to timely file any periodic reports with the SEC may prevent us from complying with the NYSE rules and may make it more difficult for us to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital.\nDespite extensive efforts, we were unable to file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 within the time frame required by the SEC (including the extension permitted by Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act).\nAs a result, we were not in full compliance with the NYSE Listed Company Manual, Section 802.01E, but have cured this deficiency upon filing our Annual Report. We are required to comply with the NYSE Listed Company Manual as a condition for our common stock to continue to be listed on the NYSE. If we are unable to comply with such conditions, then our shares of common stock are subject to delisting from the NYSE. Any delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could have a significant negative effect on the value and liquidity of our securities, may preclude us from using exemptions from certain state and federal securities regulations, and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nIn addition, because we were unable to timely file our Annual Report, we will not be eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to conduct public offerings of our securities until we have timely made our periodic filings with the SEC for a full year. Our inability to use Form S-3 during this time period may have a negative impact on our ability to access the public capital markets in a timely fashion because we would be required to file a long-form registration statement on Form S-1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the SEC. This may limit our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital. Our limited ability to access the public markets could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we believe would be beneficial to our business.\nAny failure in our business systems could reduce the quality of our business services, which could harm our reputation and expose us to liability.\nOur business systems rely on the complex integration of numerous hardware and software subsystems to manage client transactions including the processing of employee, payroll and benefits data. These systems can be disrupted by, among other things, equipment failures, computer server or systems failures, network outages, malicious acts, software errors or defects, vendor performance problems and power failures. Any delay or failure in our systems that impairs our ability to communicate electronically with our clients, employees or vendors or our ability to store or process data could harm our reputation and our business. If we are unable to meet client demands or service expectations, we may lose existing clients and we may have difficulty attracting new clients. In addition, errors in our products and services, such as the erroneous denial of healthcare benefits or delays in making payroll, could expose our clients to liability claims from improperly serviced WSEs, for which we may be contractually obligated to provide indemnification.\nWe have disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our business against a multitude of events, including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, or similar events. Despite our preparations, our plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data, service interruptions, and disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities. The precautions that we have taken to protect ourselves against these types of events may prove to be inadequate. If we suffer damage to our data or operations centers, experience a telecommunications failure or experience a security breach, our operations could be interrupted. Any interruption or other loss may not be covered by our insurance and could harm our reputation.\nIf our systems were to fail for any of these reasons during payroll processing, preventing the proper payment of employees, or the proper remission of payroll taxes, we could be liable for wage payment delay penalties and payroll tax penalties, as well as other contractual penalties. Any inaccuracies in the processing of health insurance benefits could result in our being liable for lapses in insurance. If any of our systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation.\nWe depend on licenses with third-party software in order to provide our services.\nWe license a substantial portion of the software on which we depend to provide services to our clients from third-party vendors. If we are unable to maintain these licenses, or if we are required to make significant changes in the terms and conditions of these licenses, we may need to seek replacement vendors or change our software architecture to address licensing revisions with our current vendors, either of which could increase our expenses and impair the quality of our services. In addition, we cannot assure you that our key vendors will continue to support their technology. Financial or other difficulties experienced by these vendors may adversely affect the technologies we incorporate into our products and services. If this software ceases to be available, we may be unable to find suitable alternatives on reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe must keep pace with rapid technological change in order to succeed.\nOur business depends upon the use of software, hardware and networking technologies that must be frequently and rapidly upgraded in response to technological advances, competitive pressures and consumer expectations. To succeed, we will need to effectively develop or license and integrate these new technologies as they become available to improve our services commensurate with client requirements. In particular, we rely on enterprise software applications licensed from third parties that are upgraded from time to time such as PeopleSoft HR information systems and Oracle databases, which provide the basis\nfor our HR information system platform supporting payroll, benefits and other HR functions. Any difficulties we encounter in adapting applications upgrades to our systems could harm our performance or delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of new services. New products or upgrades may not be released according to schedule, or may contain defects when released. Difficulties in integrating new technologies could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our services, or client claims against us, any of which could harm our business. We could also incur substantial costs in modifying our services or infrastructure to adapt to these changes. In addition, we could lose market share if our competitors develop technologically superior products and services.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our business may be harmed.\nOur success depends in part on intellectual property rights to the services that we develop. We rely on a combination of contractual rights, including non-disclosure agreements, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our names, services, methodologies and related technologies. If we lose intellectual property protection or the ability to secure intellectual property protection on any of our names, confidential information or technology, this could harm our business. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services and methodologies similar to ours, and the steps we take might be inadequate to deter infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, any of which could harm our business. We currently have one pending U.S. patent application covering our technology. We own registered trademarks in the United States, Canada and the European Union that have various expiration dates unless renewed through customary processes. Our trademark registrations may be unenforceable or ineffective in protecting our trademarks. Our trademarks may be unenforceable in countries outside of the United States, which may adversely affect our ability to build our brand outside of the United States.\nAlthough we believe that our conduct of our business does not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, third parties may nevertheless assert infringement claims against us in the future. We may be required to modify our products, services, internal systems or technologies, or obtain a license to permit our continued use of those rights. We may be unable to do so in a timely manner, or upon reasonable terms and conditions, which could harm our business. In addition, future litigation over these matters could result in substantial costs and resource diversion. Adverse determinations in any litigation or proceedings of this type could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and could prevent us from using some of our services, internal systems or technologies.\nOur use of open source software could subject us to possible litigation.\nA portion of our technologies incorporates open source software, and we expect to continue to incorporate open source software into our platform in the future. Few of the licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and their application to the open source software integrated into our proprietary technology platform may be uncertain. If we fail to comply with these licenses, then pursuant to the terms of these licenses, we may be subject to certain requirements, including requirements that we make available the source code for our software that incorporates the open source software. We cannot assure you that we have not incorporated open source software in our software in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of the applicable licenses or our current policies and procedures. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our technology platform.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile for the foreseeable future. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in March 2014 at a price of $16.00 per share, the daily closing price of our common stock has ranged from $16.33 to $37.88 per share through December 31, 2015. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the factors listed below and other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nany financial projections we provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our company;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other business services companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nchanges in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the United States and abroad; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many business services companies. Stock prices of many business services companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. Securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock in one or more transactions and at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were 4,446,149 shares of common stock subject to outstanding options, 956,687 shares of common stock issuable upon settlement of restricted stock units and 173,286 shares of common stock issuable upon settlement of performance-based restricted stock units. We have registered all of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of these outstanding options and settlement of these outstanding restricted stock units, and upon exercise or settlement of any options or other equity incentives we may grant in the future, as well as the shares we have reserved for future issuance under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, for public resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Accordingly, these shares are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent such options are exercised or such restricted stock units settle, or such shares are purchased pursuant to our ESPP, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the holders of 20,091,312 shares of common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of such shares or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for TriNet or our stockholders.\nThe existing ownership of capital stock by our executive officers, directors and their affiliates has the effect of concentrating voting control with our executive officers, directors and their affiliates for the foreseeable future, which limits your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2015, funds affiliated with General Atlantic, our largest stockholder, beneficially own approximately 28.6% of our outstanding common stock, and all of our directors, officers and their affiliates, including the funds affiliated with General Atlantic, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 40.8% of our outstanding common stock. As\na result, these stockholders will be able to determine substantially all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit our board of directors to establish the number of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for our stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any holder of at least 15% of our capital stock for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became a 15% stockholder.", "PERMNO": 14521, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "TNET"}
