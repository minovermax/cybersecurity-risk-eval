{"cik": "895126", "company": "CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThere are numerous factors that affect our business and operating results, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of significant factors that might cause our future results to differ materially from those currently expected. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial position, operating results, cash flows, reserves and/or our ability to pay our debts and other liabilities could suffer, the trading price and liquidity of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our securities.\nOil, natural gas and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur revenues, operating results, profitability, liquidity and ability to grow depend primarily upon the prices we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGL we sell. We incur substantial expenditures to replace reserves, sustain production and fund our business plans. Low oil, natural gas and NGL prices can negatively affect the amount of cash available for capital expenditures, debt service and debt repayment and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves. In addition, periods of low oil and natural gas prices may result in a reduction of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties due to recognizing impairments in proved and unproved properties.\nHistorically, the markets for oil, natural gas and NGL have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. For example, during the period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019, NYMEX WTI oil prices ranged from a high of $107.26 per bbl to a low of $26.21 per bbl and NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas prices ranged from a high of $6.15 per mmbtu to a low of $1.64 per mmbtu. As of February 19, 2020, the NYMEX WTI oil price was $53.29 per bbl and the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price was $1.99 per mmbtu.\nWide fluctuations in oil, natural gas and NGL prices may result from factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide supplies of oil, natural gas and NGL, including U.S. inventories of oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the level of consumer and industrial demand, including impacts from global or national health epidemics and concerns, such as the recent coronavirus;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of worldwide conservation measures;\n\u2022\nthe availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and processing facilities;\n\u2022\nthe level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including by commodity price speculators and others;\n\u2022\nU.S. exports of oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022\nthe price and level of foreign imports;\n\u2022\nthe nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nincreased use of competing energy products, including alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\npolitical instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and global economic conditions.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil, natural gas and NGL price movements. As of February 19, 2020, including January and February derivative contracts that have settled, approximately 70% of our 2020 forecasted oil, natural gas and NGL production revenue was hedged. We had approximately 76% downside oil price protection through swaps and collars at an average price of $59.90 per bbl. We\nhad 39% downside gas price protection through swaps at $2.76 per mcf and 14% under put spread arrangements based on an average bought put NYMEX price of $2.05 per mcf and exposure below an average sold put NYMEX price of $1.80 per mcf. Even with oil, natural gas and NGL derivatives currently in place to mitigate price risks associated with a portion of our 2020 cash flows, we have substantial exposure to oil, natural gas and NGL prices in 2020 and 2021 and beyond. In addition, a prolonged extension of lower prices could reduce the quantities of reserves that we may economically produce.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects, and we may have difficulty paying our debts as they become due.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $8.916 billion in principal amount of debt outstanding (including $301 million of current maturities and $1.590 billion drawn under our senior secured revolving credit facility). As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $59 million of letters of credit issued and borrowing capacity of approximately $1.351 billion under our $3.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility. See Note 5 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our debt obligations, including debt maturities for the next five years and thereafter.\nThe level of and terms and conditions governing our debt:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing debt obligations and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of our business, economic downturns or other adverse developments in our business;\n\u2022\ncould limit our ability to access capital markets, refinance our existing indebtedness, raise capital on favorable terms, or obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, or for other purposes;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under the Chesapeake revolving credit facility, bear interest at floating rates;\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on our ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets and engage in business combinations;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with lower levels of indebtedness in relation to their overall size, or those that have less restrictive terms governing their indebtedness, thereby enabling competitors to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness may prevent us from pursuing;\n\u2022\nlimit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business; and\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing.\nAny of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur ability to pay our expenses and fund our working capital needs and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as commodity prices, other economic conditions and governmental regulation. We have drawn on our $3.0 billion credit facility for liquidity, and the borrowing base is subject to a redetermination in the second quarter of 2020. If our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility decreases as a result of lower prices of oil, natural gas or NGL, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations and growth at current levels. To the extent that the value of the collateral pledged under our credit facility declines as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices, asset dispositions or otherwise, we may be required to pledge additional collateral to maintain the current availability of the commitments thereunder, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain a sufficiently high valuation to maintain the current commitments. In addition, we cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and other obligations, we may be required to restructure or refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, borrow more money or raise equity, some or all of which may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, if at all, or such alternative strategies may yield insufficient funds to make required payments on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness\ncould be affected by our future performance and events or circumstances beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default under such indebtedness, the potential acceleration of our obligation to repay outstanding debt and the potential foreclosure on the collateral securing such debt, and could cause a cross-default under our other outstanding indebtedness. Any of the above risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe have significant capital needs, and our ability to access the capital and credit markets to raise capital on favorable terms is limited by our debt level and industry conditions.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Low commodity prices have caused and may continue to cause lenders to increase the interest rates under our credit facilities, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt around maturity on favorable terms or at all and may reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and our ability to repay or refinance our debt. Additionally, challenges in the economy have led and could further lead to reductions in the demand for oil and gas, or further reductions in the prices of oil and gas, or both, which could have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or are unable to use future borrowings to refinance our indebtedness or fund other capital needs, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, which may have onerous terms or may be unavailable.\nOur earnings and cash flow could vary significantly from year to year due to the volatility of hydrocarbon commodity prices. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments. A range of economic, competitive, business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and service our debt. Factors that may cause us to generate cash flow that is insufficient to meet our debt obligations include the events and risks related to our business, many of which are beyond our control. Any cash flow insufficiency would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and our ability to repay or refinance our debt.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness, or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay or refinance our indebtedness, we may be required to undertake various alternative financing plans, which may include:\n\u2022\nrefinancing or restructuring all or a portion of our debt;\n\u2022\nseeking alternative financing or additional capital investment;\n\u2022\nselling strategic assets;\n\u2022\nreducing or delaying capital investments, including by curtailing our drilling program; or\n\u2022\nrevising or delaying our strategic plans.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of the above alternative financing plans, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to obtain alternative financing, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. Any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could significantly harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Further, if for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our debt, which would allow our creditors under those agreements to declare all outstanding indebtedness thereunder to be due and payable (which would in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights between the relevant agreements), the lenders under our credit facilities could terminate their commitments to extend credit, and the lenders could foreclose against our assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, the lenders under our credit facilities could compel us to apply our available cash to repay our borrowings. If the amounts outstanding under the credit facilities or any of our other significant indebtedness were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the amounts owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan facility bear interest at a variable rate and expose us to interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2019, we had $3.1 billion of variable rate indebtedness outstanding. If interest rates increase and we are unable to hedge our interest rate risk on acceptable terms, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same.\nRestrictive covenants in certain of our debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nOur debt agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake investments or loans;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsummate mergers and similar fundamental changes;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake investments in unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nuse the proceeds of asset sales.\nWe may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under certain of our debt agreements. The restrictions contained in the covenants could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions, to meet capital needs or otherwise to restrict our activities or business plan; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or divestitures to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nAlso, our credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests, including a leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter of not greater than 4.50 to1 through the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021, with step-downs to 4.25 to 1 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022 and to 4.00 to 1 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter, a first lien secured leverage ratio of not greater than 2.50 to 1 as of the end of each fiscal quarter, and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1 as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2019, 2.25 to 1 as of the end of each fiscal quarter ending March 31 and June 30, 2020, and 2.50 to 1 as of the end of each fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2020 and thereafter. Our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition tests may be affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, we may be unable to meet these ratios and financial condition tests. These financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a continued downturn in our business or a downturn in the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. Further declines in oil, NGL and natural gas prices, or a prolonged period of low oil, NGL and natural gas prices could eventually result in our failing to meet one or more of the financial covenants under our credit facility, which could require us to refinance or amend such obligations resulting in the payment of consent fees or higher interest rates, or require us to raise additional capital at an inopportune time or on terms not favorable to us.\nA breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could result in a default under our credit facility that, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder and cross-default rights under our other debt. If that should occur, we may be unable to pay all such debt or to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, in the event of an event of default under the credit facility or other indebtedness, the affected lenders could foreclose on the collateral securing the credit facility and require repayment of all borrowings outstanding thereunder. If the amounts outstanding under the credit facility or any of our\nother indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the amounts owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders.\nIf we cannot meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, the NYSE may delist our common stock, which would have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock and allow holders of our convertible senior notes to require us to repurchase their notes.\nOn December 10, 2019, we were notified by the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) that the average closing price of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d), over a prior 30 consecutive trading day period was below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum average closing price per share required to maintain listing on the NYSE under Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. We have a period of six months following the receipt of the notice to regain compliance with the minimum share price requirement, with the possibility of extension at the discretion of the NYSE. In order to regain compliance, on the last trading day in any calendar month during the cure period, the Common Stock must have: (i) a closing price of at least $1.00 per share; and (ii) an average closing price of at least $1.00 per share over the 30 trading day period ending on the last trading day of such month. If we fail to regain compliance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual by the end of the cure period, the Common Stock will be subject to the NYSE\u2019s suspension and delisting procedures. To regain compliance with NYSE listing standards we intend to implement a reverse stock split, subject to approval of our board of directors and shareholders.\nIf the Common Stock ultimately were to be delisted for any reason, it could negatively impact us as it would likely reduce the liquidity and market price of the Common Stock; reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire the Common Stock; and negatively impact our ability to access equity markets and obtain financing. If the Common Stock were to be removed from listing on the NYSE (and the Common Stock were not to become listed on other specified stock exchanges), holders of our convertible senior notes would have a right to require us to repurchase their notes. As of December 31, 2019, there was $1.06 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes outstanding, and there can be no assurance we would be able to repurchase such notes if required to do so in connection with a delisting.\nOur credit rating could negatively impact our availability and cost of capital and could require us to post more collateral under certain commercial arrangements.\nSome of our counterparties have requested or required us to post collateral as financial assurance of our performance under certain contractual arrangements, such as gathering, transportation, processing and hedging agreements. These collateral requirements depend, in part, on our credit ratings. As of February 24, 2020, we have posted approximately $60 million of collateral related to certain of our marketing and other contracts. We may be requested or required by other counterparties to post additional collateral in an aggregate amount of approximately $220 million, which may be in the form of additional letters of credit, cash or other acceptable collateral. Any downgrade to our credit ratings could impact the posting of collateral consisting of cash or letters of credit, which would reduce availability under our credit facility, and negatively impact our liquidity.\nIf commodity prices remain depressed or drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to record write downs of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nWe have been required to write down the carrying value of certain of our oil and natural gas properties in the past and there is a risk that we will be required to take additional writedowns in the future. Writedowns may occur in the future when oil and natural gas prices are low, or if we have downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of operating or development costs, or due to the anticipated sale of properties.\nThe successful efforts method of accounting requires that we periodically review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment. Impairment is recognized for the excess of book value over fair value when the book value of a proven property is greater than the expected undiscounted future net cash flows from that property and on acreage when conditions indicate the carrying value is not recoverable. We may be required to write down the carrying value of a property based on oil and natural gas prices at the time of the impairment review, or as a result of continuing evaluation of drilling results, production data, economics, divestiture activity, and other factors. A writedown constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings and does not impact cash or cash flows from operating activities; however, it reflects our long-term ability to recover an investment, reduces our reported earnings and increases certain leverage ratios. See Impairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties included in Item 7 of this report for further information.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves and conduct our business.\nOur exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. We intend to fund our capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, and to the extent that is not sufficient, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our ability to generate operating cash flow is subject to a number of risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of oil, natural gas and NGL, our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed herein. Our forecasted 2020 capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized interest, are $1.3 - $1.6 billion compared to our 2019 capital spending level of $2.2 billion. Management continues to review operational plans for 2020 and beyond, which could result in changes to projected capital expenditures and projected revenues from sales of oil, natural gas and NGL. If we are unable to fund our capital expenditures as planned, we could experience a curtailment of our exploration and development activity, a loss of properties and a decline in our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.\nIf we are not able to replace reserves, we may not be able to sustain production.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, exploration or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Thus, our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves.\nThe actual quantities of and future net revenues from our proved reserves may be less than our estimates.\nThe estimates of our proved reserves and the estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves included in this report are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil, natural gas and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil, natural gas and NGL reserves is complex and involves significant decisions and assumptions associated with geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each well. Therefore, these estimates are subject to future revisions.\nActual future production, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil, natural gas and NGL reserves most likely will vary from these estimates. Such variations may be significant and could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our proved reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development drilling, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 46% of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflect our plans to make significant capital expenditures to convert our PUDs into proved developed reserves, including approximately $5 billion during the next five years ending in 2024. You should be aware that the estimated development costs may not equal our actual costs, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop our PUDs, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove them from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC's reserve reporting rules, because PUDs generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any PUDs that are not developed within this five-year time frame.\nYou should not assume that the present values included in this report represent the current market value of our estimated reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimates of our present values are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimates. The price on the date of estimate is calculated as the average oil and natural gas price during the 12 months ending in the current reporting period, determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period. The December 31, 2019 present value is based on a $55.69 per bbl of oil price and a $2.58 per mcf of natural gas price, before considering basis differential adjustments. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of an estimate.\nThe timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. Any changes in demand for oil and natural gas, governmental regulations or taxation will also affect the future net cash flows from our production. In addition, the 10% discount factor that is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor. Interest\nrates in effect from time to time and the risks associated with our business or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the appropriateness of the 10% discount factor.\nOur development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nWe have a substantial inventory of undeveloped properties. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be discovered. We have acquired undeveloped properties that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our initial investments. Additionally, there can be no assurance that undeveloped properties acquired by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive, or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such undeveloped properties or wells.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property. Drilling and completion operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions, title problems, equipment failures or accidents, shortages of midstream transportation, equipment or personnel, environmental issues, state or local bans or moratoriums on hydraulic fracturing and produced water disposal, and a decline in commodity prices, among others. The profitability of wells, particularly in certain of the areas in which we operate, will be reduced or eliminated if commodity prices decline. In addition, wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets, which are dependent upon the current and future market prices for oil, natural gas and NGL, costs associated with producing oil, natural gas and NGL and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost.\nWe rely to a significant extent on seismic data and other technologies in evaluating undeveloped properties and in conducting our exploration activities. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively, prior to acquisition of undeveloped properties, or drilling a well, whether oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. If we incur significant expense in acquiring or developing properties that do not produce as expected or at profitable levels, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our undeveloped properties are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage or the leases are renewed.\nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. If our leases on our undeveloped properties expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Although we seek to actively manage our undeveloped properties, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Low commodity prices may cause us to delay our drilling plans and, as a result, lose our right to develop the related properties.\nOur commodity price risk management activities may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodity prices, may require us to provide collateral for derivative liabilities and involve risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us.\nTo manage our exposure to price volatility, we enter into oil, natural gas and NGL price derivative contracts. Our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative arrangements may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodity prices. The fair value of our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative instruments can fluctuate significantly between periods. Our decision to mitigate cash flow volatility through derivative arrangements, if any, is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions and our desire to stabilize cash flows necessary for the development of our proved reserves. We may choose not to enter into derivatives if the pricing environment for certain time periods is not deemed to be favorable. Additionally, we may choose to liquidate existing derivative positions prior to the expiration of their contractual maturities to monetize gain positions for the purpose of funding our capital program.\nMost of our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts are with counterparties under bi-lateral hedging arrangements. Under a majority of our arrangements, the collateral provided for our obligations is secured by the same hydrocarbon interests that secure our senior secured revolving credit facility. Under other arrangements, our obligations under the bi-lateral hedging arrangements must be secured by cash or letters of credit to the extent that any mark-to-market amounts owed to us or by us exceed defined thresholds. Under certain circumstances, the cash collateral value posted could fall below the coverage designated, and we would be required to post additional cash or letter of credit collateral under our hedging arrangements. Our counterparties\u2019 obligations under the arrangements must be secured by cash or letters of credit to the extent that any mark-to-market amounts owed to us exceed defined thresholds. Collateral requirements are dependent to a large extent on oil and natural gas prices.\nOil, natural gas and NGL derivative transactions expose us to the risk that our counterparties, which are generally financial institutions, may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. During periods of declining commodity prices, the value of our commodity derivative asset positions increase, which increases our counterparty exposure. Although the counterparties to our hedging arrangements are required to secure their obligations to us under certain scenarios, if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the derivative contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future cash flows being exposed to commodity price changes.\nThe ultimate outcome of pending legal and governmental proceedings is uncertain, and there are significant costs associated with these matters.\nWe are defending against claims by royalty owners alleging, among other things, that we used below-market prices, made improper deductions, used improper measurement techniques, entered into arrangements with affiliates that resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with the production and sales of natural gas and NGL and similar theories. Numerous cases are pending. The resolution of disputes regarding past payments could cause our future obligations to royalty owners to increase and would negatively impact our future results of operations.\nIn addition, there are ongoing governmental regulatory investigations and inquiries into various matters such as our royalty practices. The outcome of any pending or future litigation or governmental regulatory matter is uncertain and may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we have incurred substantial legal expenses in the past three years, and such expenses may continue to be significant in the future. Further, attention to these matters by members of our senior management has been required, reducing the time they have available to devote to managing our business.\nWe may continue to incur cash and noncash charges that would negatively impact our future results of operations and liquidity.\nWhile executing our strategic priorities to reduce financial leverage and complexity and to reduce our capital expenditures in the face of lower commodity prices, we have incurred certain cash charges, including contract termination charges, restructuring and other termination costs, financing extinguishment costs and charges for unused natural gas transportation and gathering capacity. As we continue to focus on our strategic priorities, we may incur additional cash and noncash charges in 2020 and in future years. If incurred, these charges could materially adversely impact our future results of operations and liquidity.\nOil and natural gas operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks.\nOur operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. Drilling for oil, gas and NGLs can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs. Substantial costs are required to locate, acquire and develop oil and gas properties, and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted. While both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. In addition, our oil and gas properties can become damaged, our operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions, blowouts, cratering or loss of well control, such as the January 30, 2020 well control incident at a wellsite located in Burleson County, Texas, causing the deaths of three of our contractors\u2019 employees and injuring a fourth;\n\u2022\nthe mishandling or underground migration of fluids and chemicals;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and extreme temperatures;\n\u2022\nissues with title or in receiving governmental permits or approvals;\n\u2022\nrestricted takeaway capacity for our production, including due to inadequate midstream infrastructure or constrained downstream markets;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards or liabilities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions in access to, or disposal of, water used or produced in drilling and completion operations;\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment; and\n\u2022\nunexpected or unforeseen changes in regulatory policy, and political or public opinion.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property, as well as significant liabilities. While we may maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities, and our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. For certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism and piracy, we have limited or no insurance coverage. Also, in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured may expose us to liabilities.\nMoreover, certain of these events could result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties, including persons living in proximity to our operations, our employees and employees of our contractors, leading to possible injuries, death or significant damage to property and natural resources.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which can change and could adversely impact our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal, local and other laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to environmental matters, worker health and safety, wildlife conservation, the gathering and transportation of oil, gas and NGLs, conservation policies, reporting obligations, royalty payments, unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes. Such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling, completion and well operations. If permits are not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. In addition, we may be required to make large, sometimes unexpected, expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, regulations, permits or orders.\nIn addition, changes in public policy have affected, and in the future could further affect, our operations. Regulatory developments could, among other things, restrict production levels, impose price controls, change environmental protection requirements and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to the government. Our operating and compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised, reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. We do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations, size and financial strength. Although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such changes could significantly impact our profitability, financial condition and liquidity. This is particularly true of changes related to pipeline safety, seismic activity and climate change, as discussed below.\nPipeline Safety. The pipeline assets in which we own interests are subject to stringent and complex regulations related to pipeline safety and integrity management. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for gas, NGL and condensate transmission pipelines as well as for certain low stress pipelines and gathering lines transporting hazardous liquids, such as oil, that, in the event of a failure, could affect \u201chigh consequence areas.\u201d In October 2019, PHMSA issued three new final rules, that, among other things, extend certain requirements for integrity assessments and leak detections beyond high consequence areas. At this time, we cannot\npredict the cost of these requirements or other potential new or amended regulations, but they could be significant. Moreover, violations of pipeline safety regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties.\nHydraulic Fracturing. Several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. We cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations, our business and operations could be subject to delays, increased operating and compliance costs and potential bans. Additional regulation could also lead to greater opposition to hydraulic fracturing, including litigation.\nSeismic Activity. Earthquakes in some of our operating areas and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity. Legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to address these concerns may result in additional levels of regulation or other requirements that could lead to operational delays, increase our operating and compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. In addition, we are currently defending against certain third- party lawsuits and could be subject to additional claims, seeking damages or other remedies as a result of alleged induced seismic activity in our areas of operation.\nClimate Change. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative, regulatory and other initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Policy makers at both the U.S. federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories, limitations and/or taxes on greenhouse gas emissions. EPA and the BLM have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions, which also include leak detection and repair requirements, for the oil and gas industry; however, in September 2018, BLM published a final rule to repeal certain requirements of these regulations. Similarly, in September 2019, EPA published a rule proposing to reconsider certain aspects of its regulations for the control of methane emissions. Nevertheless, several states where we operate, including Wyoming, have imposed venting and flaring limitations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities. Legislative and state initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of renewable energy standards and/or cap-and-trade and/or carbon tax programs. A cap-and-trade program generally would cap overall greenhouse gas emissions on an economy- wide basis and require major sources of greenhouse gas emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances. A cap and trade program could impose direct costs on us through the purchase of allowances and could impose indirect costs by incentivizing consumers to shift away from fossil fuels. A carbon tax could directly increase our costs of operation and similarly incentivize consumers to shift away from fossil fuels.\nIn addition, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in an increasing number of financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this would make it more difficult and expensive to secure funding for exploration and production activities. These various legislative, regulatory and other activities addressing greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our business, including by imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations, which could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. Limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for oil and gas, which could lower the value of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for natural gas and oil.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to natural gas and oil, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for natural gas and oil. The impact of the changing demand for natural gas and oil could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and financial position.\nOur ability to produce oil, natural gas and NGL economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\nDevelopment activities, particularly hydraulic fracturing, require the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain areas, there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. Water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site. Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain\nareas. The imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations, such as the OCC\u2019s volume reduction plans for oil and natural gas disposal wells injecting wastewater into the Arbuckle formation and the EPA\u2019s June 2016 pretreatment standards for wastewater, could further restrict our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other materials associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas.\nEnvironmental matters and related costs can be significant.\nAs an owner, lessee or operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations. Environmental laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties, as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas. Any future costs associated with these matters are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. Changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.\nThe taxation of independent producers is subject to change, and changes in tax law could increase our cost of doing business.\nWe are subject to taxation by various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels where we do business. New legislation increasing our tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities. Recently, legislative changes imposing additional taxes or increases to existing taxes were considered in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Wyoming. It is possible that any of these states could enact new tax legislation making it more costly for us to explore for oil and natural gas resources.\nThe oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive, and some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nWe face competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, buying and selling reserves and leases, obtaining goods and services needed to operate our business and marketing oil, natural gas or NGL. Competitors include multinational oil companies, independent production companies and individual producers and operators. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and, due to our debt levels and other factors, may have greater access to the capital and credit markets. As a result, these competitors may be able to address these competitive factors more effectively or weather industry downturns more easily than we can. We also face indirect competition from alternative energy sources, including wind, solar and electric power.\nOur performance depends largely on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals and on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense. If we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining skilled employees and managerial talent, our ability to compete effectively may be diminished. We also compete for the equipment required to explore, develop and operate properties. Typically, during times of rising commodity prices, drilling and operating costs will also increase. During these periods, there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield equipment and services, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget.\nRisks related to potential acquisitions or dispositions may adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate acquisitions and dispositions of assets, businesses and other investments. These transactions may not result in the anticipated benefits or efficiencies. In addition, acquisitions may be financed by borrowings, requiring us to incur more debt, or by the issuance of our common stock. Any such acquisition or disposition involves risks and we cannot assure you that:\n\u2022\nany acquisition would be successfully integrated into our operations and internal controls;\n\u2022\nthe due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition would uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure, such as title defects and potential environmental and other liabilities;\n\u2022\npost-closing purchase price adjustments will be realized in our favor;\n\u2022\nour assumptions about, among other things, reserves, estimated production, revenues, capital expenditures, operating, operating expenses and costs would be accurate;\n\u2022\nany investment, acquisition, disposition or integration would not divert management resources from the operation of our business; and\n\u2022\nany investment, acquisition, or disposition or integration would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reserves.\nIf any of these risks materialize, the benefits of such acquisition or disposition may not be fully realized, if at all, and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves could be negatively impacted.\nA deterioration in general economic, business or industry conditions would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nHistorically, concerns about global economic growth have had a significant impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which we can sell our production, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and materially adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nTerrorist activities could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign attacks, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in commodity prices, or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, seismic activity, climate change, explosions of natural gas transmission lines and the development and operation of pipelines and other midstream facilities may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. Additionally, environmental groups, landowners, local groups and other advocates may oppose our operations through organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations or those of our midstream transportation providers, intervene in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets or those of our midstream transportation providers, or file lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the development or operation of our assets and business or those of our midstream transportation providers. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business. The 2020 presidential and congressional elections may result in a change in administration and control of Congress with the potential consequence of increased restrictions on oil and gas production activities, which could materially adversely affect our industry and our financial condition and results of operations.\nRecently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention towards sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in energy-related activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, trucking and gathering system capacity constraints and may be subject to interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow.\nIn certain resource plays, the capacity of gathering and transportation systems is insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells. We rely heavily on third parties to meet our oil, natural gas and NGL gathering needs. Capital constraints could limit the construction of new pipelines and gathering systems and the providing or expansion of trucking services by third parties. Until this new capacity is available, we may experience delays in producing and selling our oil, natural gas and NGL. In such event, we might have to shut in our wells awaiting\na pipeline connection or capacity or sell oil, natural gas or NGL production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on NYMEX or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our oil, natural gas and NGL production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could materially adversely affect our cash flow.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry and related regulations may adversely impact our operations and, if we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our data, our business may be harmed.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our customers, employees and third-party partners. We have been the subject of cyber-attacks on our internal systems and through those of third parties, but these incidents did not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Nevertheless, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information, customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations or planned business transactions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. If our information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, which may include drilling, completion, production and corporate functions. A cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could result in supply chain disruptions that delay or prevent the transportation and marketing of our production, non-compliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability, and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.\nFurther, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks. In addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) was signed into law on June 28, 2018 and largely took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and enhanced consumer protections for those individuals, and provides for statutory fines for data security breaches or other CCPA violations. Meanwhile, over fifteen other states have considered privacy laws like the CCPA.\nAn interruption in operations at our headquarters could adversely affect our business.\nOur headquarters are located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, an area that experiences severe weather events, including tornadoes and earthquakes. Our information systems and administrative and management processes are primarily provided to our various drilling projects and producing wells throughout the United States from this location, which could be disrupted if a catastrophic event, such as a tornado, power outage or act of terror, destroyed or severely damaged our headquarters. Any such catastrophic event could harm our ability to conduct normal operations and could adversely affect our business.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the near future.\nIn July 2015, our Board of Directors determined to eliminate quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. We do not intend to resume paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any earnings for the future operation and development of our business, including exploration, development and acquisition activities or to retire outstanding debt or preferred stock. Any future dividend payments will require approval by the Board of Directors. In addition, dividends may be restricted by the terms of our debt agreements. Additionally, our Board of Directors may determine to suspend dividend payments on our preferred stock in the future. If we fail to pay dividends on our preferred stock with respect to six or more quarterly periods (whether or not consecutive), the holders of our preferred stock, voting as a single class, will be entitled at the next regular or special meeting of shareholders to elect two additional directors of the Company. We had previously failed to pay dividends on our outstanding preferred stock with respect to four quarterly periods during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, before resuming payment, in arrears, in the first quarter of 2017.\nCertain anti-takeover and other provisions may affect your rights as a shareholder.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to set the terms of and issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. Our Board of Directors could use the preferred stock as a means to delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider to be in our best interest. In addition, our revolving credit facility, term loan facility, preferred stock and certain of our notes contain terms that may restrict our ability to enter into change of control transactions, including requirements to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to offer to purchase our term loan and to offer to repurchase such notes on a change in control. These provisions, along with specified provisions of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, may discourage or impede transactions involving actual or potential changes in our control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the WildHorse Merger.\nThe success of the WildHorse Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our and WildHorse\u2019s businesses, including operational and other synergies that we believe the combined company will achieve. We achieved $250 million of cost savings in 2019 and we expect that the WildHorse Merger will provide substantial cost savings with $200 million to $280 million in projected average annual savings, totaling $1 billion to $1.5 billion by 2023, due to operational and capital efficiencies as a result of Chesapeake\u2019s significant expertise with unconventional assets and technical and operational excellence. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of the WildHorse Merger may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Some of the assumptions that we have made, such as the achievement of operational cost savings, may not be realized. The integration process may, for us and WildHorse, result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. There could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the WildHorse Merger that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence. The integration will require significant time and focus from management following the acquisition.\nThe issuance of our common stock to shareholders of WildHorse as well as other stock transactions could lead to a limitation on the utilization of our loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforwards and possibly other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income and federal income tax is subject to various limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The utilization of such attributes may be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code should transactions involving our equity, including issuances of our stock or the sale or exchange of our stock by certain shareholders, result in a cumulative shift of more than 50% in the beneficial ownership of our stock during any three-year testing period (an \u201cOwnership Change\u201d). The annual limitation is generally equal to the product of (a) the fair market value of our equity multiplied by (b) the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect for the month in which an Ownership Change occurs. If we are in a net unrealized built-in gain position at the time of an Ownership Change, then the limitation is increased by recognized built-in gains occurring within a five-year period following the Ownership Change, but only to the extent of the net unrealized built-in gain which existed at the time of the Ownership Change. However, proposed regulations issued on September 10, 2019, and on January 14, 2020, under Section 382(h) of the Code (the \u201cProposed Regulations\u201d) would, if finalized in their current form, limit the potential increases to the annual limitation amount for certain built-in gains existing at the time of an Ownership Change, (unless the transition relief provisions of the Proposed Regulations are applicable), thereby significantly reducing the ability to utilize tax attributes. If we are in a net unrealized built-in loss position at the\ntime of an Ownership Change, then the limitation may apply to tax attributes other than just NOL carryforwards and disallowed business interest carryforwards, such as depreciable basis of tangible equipment. Some states impose similar limitations on tax attribute utilization upon experiencing an Ownership Change.\nWe believe that based on information currently available neither the WildHorse Merger, the exchanges of our common stock for certain outstanding senior notes that occurred during 2019 nor the exchange of our common stock for certain Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock that also occurred during 2019 resulted in an Ownership Change. Therefore, with the exception of the NOL carryforwards and disallowed business interest carryforwards acquired upon the WildHorse Merger, we do not believe we have a limitation on the ability to utilize our carryforwards and other tax attributes under Section 382 of the Code as of December 31, 2019. However, issuances, sales or exchanges of our stock (including, potentially, relatively small transactions and transactions beyond our control) occurring after December 31, 2019, taken together with other prior transactions with respect to our stock, could trigger an Ownership Change and therefore a limitation on our ability to utilize our carryforwards and other tax attributes. Furthermore, if such an Ownership Change were to occur and the Proposed Regulations are finalized in their current form, the severity of the limitation may worsen due to the inability to consider certain recognized built-in gains in the calculation of the annual limitation amount. Any such limitation could result in a significant portion of our NOL carryforwards expiring before we would be able to utilize them to reduce taxable income in future periods. Based on the foregoing, certain NOL carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforwards and other tax attributes may need to be written off or have a valuation allowance maintained against them which may result in a material charge to income tax expense.", "PERMNO": 78877, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CHKAQ"}
