The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the risks and uncertainties described below, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe experienced a net loss of $26.5 million, $7.3 million and $10.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We cannot predict if we will achieve profitability in the near future or at all. We expect to make significant future expenditures to develop and expand our business. Our prior growth in revenue may not return or be sustainable, and we might not achieve sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Information on our going concern and management\u2019s plan to continue to support its operations and meet its obligations is included in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8: \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe market for health insurance exchanges in the United States is relatively undeveloped, rapidly evolving and volatile, which makes it difficult to forecast adoption rates and demand for our solutions. If the market does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, or if individuals, brokers or health plans select more traditional or alternative channels for the purchase and sale of health insurance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe market for health insurance exchanges in the United States is relatively undeveloped, rapidly evolving and volatile. Accordingly, our future financial performance will depend in part on growth in this market and on our ability to adapt to emerging demands and trends in this market. Demand for our exchange solutions has been driven in large part by recent regulatory changes, broader use of the Internet, shifts from group plans to the purchase of individual plans and advances in technology. It is difficult to predict, with any precision, adoption rates or the future growth rate and size of our target market. The market for health insurance sales automation software is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. The volatility and rapidly evolving nature of the market in which we operate, as well as other factors that are beyond our control, reduces our ability to accurately evaluate our long-term outlook and forecast annual performance.\nAdditionally, our success depends in part upon widespread individual and health plan acceptance of the Internet as a shopping platform and marketplace for the purchase and sale of health insurance. Individuals, employers, employees and health plans may choose to depend on more traditional sources, such as individual agents, or alternative sources may develop, including as a result of significant reforms to healthcare legislation through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or HCERA, which we refer to collectively as Healthcare Reform.\nA reduction or slowdown in demand for health insurance exchanges caused by shifts in the marketplace, lack of acceptance, technological challenges, and competing solutions, or as a result of individuals, brokers, or health plans determining that other distribution channels for health insurance are superior to ours, would have a material adverse effect on our business, future growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur history of incurring substantial levels of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting obligations on our indebtedness.\nWe have a history of incurring substantial amounts of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was $32.5 million. Our indebtedness, combined with our other existing and any future financial obligations and contractual commitments, including the requirement that the holders of our outstanding Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d) consent before we incur any additional indebtedness outside of the ordinary course of business, could have important adverse consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including making interest payments on our debt obligations, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, selling and marketing efforts, research and development and other purposes;\n\u2022\ncause us to incur substantial fees from time to time in connection with debt amendments or refinancing;\n\u2022\nincrease our exposure to rising interest rates because a portion of our borrowings is at variable interest rates;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to pursue acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the health insurance industry;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, selling and marketing efforts, research and development and other corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have relatively less indebtedness.\nSee the section titled \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources-Senior Credit Facility\u201d for a description of our bank credit facility.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, and may dilute the ownership of our common stock.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth strategy and might require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new products and services or enhance our existing services, enhance our operating infrastructure, and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we might need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Our ability to raise additional capital may be impaired by the requirement that the holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) and the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock consent to the issuance of senior equity and that the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock consent to the incurrence of additional indebtedness outside of the ordinary course of business. If we raise additional funds through new issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which might make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we might not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. Similarly, upon the occurrence of certain fundamental events, the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock (which we refer to collectively as our \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) will have the right to require us to repurchase any or all of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, respectively. It is possible that we would not have sufficient funds at the time that we are required to make any such purchase of Preferred Stock. We cannot assure the holders of our Preferred Stock that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the repurchase price in cash with respect to any such Preferred Stock that holders have requested to be repurchased upon the occurrence of such an event. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nIf our existing customers do not continue or renew their agreements with us, renew at lower fee levels, decline to license additional software or purchase additional applications and services from us, or if customers with variable usage fees are unable to effectively increase their transaction volumes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, including cash flows from operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewal of existing customer agreements and sales of additional software and services to existing customers and expect to continue to do so. As a result, achieving a high renewal rate of our customer agreements and selling additional software and services is critical to our future operating results and cash flow.\nWe generally sell our software and services pursuant to agreements for terms of multiple years. Our customers may choose not to renew these contracts after the initial contract period expires. Additionally, some of our customers are able to terminate their respective contracts without cause or for convenience at any time. We may not be able to accurately predict future trends in customer renewals, and our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate. Without the continuance or renewal of our customer contracts our business and operating results may suffer.\nFactors that may affect the renewal rate for our existing contracts, and our ability to sell additional applications and services, include:\n\u2022\nthe price, performance and functionality of our offering;\n\u2022\nthe availability, price, performance and functionality of competing solutions;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop complementary applications and services;\n\u2022\nour continued ability to access the pricing and other data necessary to enable us to deliver reliable offerings to customers;\n\u2022\nthe stability, performance and security of our hosting infrastructure and hosting services;\n\u2022\nchanges in healthcare laws, regulations or trends; and\n\u2022\nthe business environment of our customers.\nIf any of our customers terminate or do not renew their contracts for our services, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality or software, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our profitability and gross margins may be harmed.\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from arrangements having variable usage and commission revenue dependent on actual customer usage and consumer enrollments in health and ancillary insurance policies. Our customers may not be successful at maintaining or increasing transaction volumes processed through our web-based software solutions. As a result, we may not be able to achieve desired business and operating results from such variable usage and commission transaction arrangements.\nA significant amount of our revenue is derived from a limited number of customers, and any reduction in revenue from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ten largest customers by revenue accounted for 52.2% of our consolidated revenue in 2016. If any of our key customers decides not to renew its contracts with us, or to renew on less favorable terms, our business, revenue, reputation, and our ability to obtain new customers could be materially and adversely affected. Except for one customer, none of our customers accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in 2016.\nFailure to manage our anticipated long-term growth effectively could increase our expenses, decrease our revenue and prevent us from implementing our business strategy.\nTo manage our anticipated future growth effectively, we must continue to maintain and enhance our information technology infrastructure, financial and accounting systems and controls. We also must attract, train and retain qualified software engineers, technical and management personnel, sales and marketing personnel, customer support personnel and professional services personnel. Failure to effectively manage our growth could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in development and operations, result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems or controls, give rise to operational mistakes, losses, loss of productivity or business opportunities and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees. Our anticipated growth could require significant capital expenditures and might divert financial resources from other projects such as the development of new products and services. If our management is unable to effectively manage our anticipated growth, our expenses might increase more than expected, our revenue could decline or might grow more slowly than expected, and we might be unable to implement our business strategy. The quality of our products and services might suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers.\nWe have experienced quarterly fluctuations, and expect to continue to experience quarterly fluctuations, in our operating results, including cash flows from operations, due to a number of factors, including the seasonality of our revenue, the sales and implementation cycles for our products and services, dependence on variable customer usage and marketplace transaction volumes, and other factors, that make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and our operating results are traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each year as a result of the open enrollment period established by PPACA and other requirements and regulations with respect to the sales and marketing of Medicare plans. Therefore, our stock price might be based on expectations of future performance that we might not meet and, if our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nThe sales cycle for our products and services can vary from, on average, two to 12 or more months, from initial contact to contract execution, depending on the client and complexity of the solution. After a customer contract is signed, we provide an implementation process for the customer which typically ranges from two to four months for our cloud-based implementations and from three to 15 months for complex enterprise implementations, each from contract execution to completion of implementation. As a result, the period of time between contract signing and recognition of associated revenue may be lengthy, and we are not able to predict with certainty the period in which implementation will be completed.\nDuring the sales and implementation cycles for our enterprise segments, we expend substantial time and effort, and incur significant additional operating expenses, but accounting principles do not allow us to recognize the resulting revenue until implementation is complete and the services are available for use by our customers, at which time we begin recognition of implementation revenue over the life of the contract or the estimated period of customer benefit, whichever is longer. Unanticipated difficulties and delays in implementation might arise as a result of failure by us or our customers to complete one or more of our or their respective responsibilities and, if implementation periods are extended or implementations are cancelled, revenue recognition could be delayed or fail to occur.\nOur operating results have varied in the past. In addition to the other risk factors listed in this section, some of the important factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results include:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of cash payments received from the delivery of our software solutions;\n\u2022\nour increasing dependency on marketplace transaction volumes to generate variable usage and commission revenue;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our products and services achieve or maintain market acceptance;\n\u2022\nour ability to introduce new products and services and enhancements to our existing products and services on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nnew competitors and the introduction of enhanced products and services from competitors;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of our current and potential customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer budgets and procurement policies;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our investment in research and development activities;\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties with our products or interruptions in our services;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, including our sales force;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment related to benefits and healthcare;\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance costs;\n\u2022\nthe timing, size and ability to successfully integrate potential future acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs.\nIn addition, a significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue. Accordingly, unexpected revenue shortfalls might decrease our gross margins and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.\nWe operate in the highly competitive software industry. If we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nThe software market is highly competitive and is likely to attract increased competition, which could make it hard for us to succeed. Small, specialized providers continue to become more sophisticated and effective. In addition, large, well-financed, and technologically sophisticated software companies might focus more on our market. The size and financial strength of these entities is increasing as a result of continued consolidation in both the IT and health insurance industries. We expect large integrated software companies to become more active in our market, both through acquisitions and internal investment. As costs fall and technology improves, increased market saturation might change the competitive landscape in favor of our competitors.\nSome of our current competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and significantly greater resources than we do. As a result, our competitors might be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements. In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and might in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies, or services to increase the availability of their products in the marketplace. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances might emerge that have greater market share, a larger customer base, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Further, in light of these advantages, even if our products and services are more effective than those of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitive offerings in lieu of purchasing our offerings. Increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability or market share. In addition to new niche vendors, who offer stand-alone products and services, we face competition from existing enterprise vendors, including those currently focused on software solutions that have information systems in place with potential customers in our target market. These existing enterprise vendors might promise products or services that offer ease of integration with existing systems and which leverage existing vendor relationships. In addition, large health plans often have internal technology staffs and proprietary software for benefits and distribution management, making them less likely to buy our solutions.\nIf our transition from our current technology platforms to new platforms does not occur rapidly or as efficiently as anticipated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are expanding our software-as-a-service, or SaaS, and other cloud based and hosted offerings, including building new shared capabilities such as consumer shopping and personalization. Our ability to (i) complete that development and (ii) efficiently transition existing enterprise-platform customers to updated components is important to our future operating results. We are also investing in platform delivery improvements that will lower our cost of implementation and configuration and improve competitiveness. Our SaaS business model depends heavily on achieving economies of scale because the initial upfront investment is costly and the associated revenue is recognized on a ratable basis. If we fail to achieve efficient transitions, improvements to our capabilities, appropriate economies of scale or if we fail to manage or anticipate the evolution and demand of the SaaS pricing model, then our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn the event that our proprietary software does not operate properly, our reputation would suffer, claims would likely be asserted against us, and we would likely be required to divert our resources from other purposes, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProprietary software development is time-consuming, expensive and complex. We may experience difficulties with software development, industry standards, design or marketing that could delay or prevent the development, introduction, or implementation of new solutions and enhancements. If our solutions do not function reliably or fail to achieve customer expectations in terms of performance, customers could assert liability claims against us and/or attempt to cancel their contracts with us. This could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain customers.\nMoreover, software as complex as ours has in the past contained, and may in the future contain, or develop, undetected defects or errors. Material performance problems or defects in our products and services might arise in the future. Errors might result from the interface of our services with legacy systems and data, which we did not develop and the function of which is outside of our control. Defects or errors might arise in our existing or new software or service processes. Because changes in health plan and legal requirements and practices relating to health insurance are frequent, we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices. These defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of enrollment by our customers, loss of revenue or market share, liability to customers or others, failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion, diversion of development and other resources, injury to our reputation, and increased service and maintenance costs. Defects or errors in our product or service processes might discourage existing or potential customers from purchasing services from us. Correcting defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable. The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability might be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur customers might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect, error, or other failure of our product or service processes. A claim could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of such claim.\nIf we do not continue to provide innovative products and services, along with high quality support services, that are useful to our customers and consumers of insurance products, we might not remain competitive and our newer solutions may not be adopted by new and existing customers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to successfully develop and sell innovative products and services that health insurance plans and brokers and their customers will utilize. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing products and services and introduce new high quality products and services that customers will want. If we are unable to predict preferences of our customers or consumers or industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our products and services on a timely basis, we might lose customers. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our customers, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market. As technology continues to develop, our competitors might be able to offer results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than those generated by us. This would force us to compete on additional product and service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.\nOur success also depends on providing high quality support services to resolve any issues related to our products and services. High quality education and customer support are important for the successful marketing and sale of our products and services and for the renewal of existing customers. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers would be harmed.\nFailure to adequately develop and deploy our direct sales force could impede our growth.\nWe believe that our future growth will depend on the continued development of our direct sales force and its ability to obtain new customers and sell additional products and services to existing customers. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our software requires significant time, expense, and attention. It can take up to nine months or longer before a new sales representative is fully trained and productive. Our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to retain, attract, and train our direct sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue. In particular, if we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel or if new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, sales of our products and services will suffer and our growth will be impeded.\nWe rely on data center providers, Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, third-party computer hardware and software, other third parties, and our own systems for providing services to our customers, and any failure of or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and may negatively impact our relationships with customers, adversely affecting our brand and our business.\nWe currently serve our customers from two primary data centers, one located in Atlanta, Georgia and the other located in El Segundo, California. While we control and have access to our servers, we do not control the operation of these facilities. The owners of our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. With respect to the provision of core services, our two data center agreements provide for either automatic renewal or routine renewal unless terminated by one of the parties. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. Problems faced by our third-party data center locations, with the telecommunications network providers with whom we or they contract, or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our customers. Our third-party data centers operators could decide to close their facilities without adequate notice. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy faced by our third-party data centers operators or any of the service providers with whom we or they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict.\nIn addition, our ability to deliver our web-based services depends on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, bandwidth capacity and security. Our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments. However, we have experienced and expect that we will experience future interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of our systems, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with customers. To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:\n\u2022\ndamage from fire, power loss, natural disasters and other force majeure events outside our control;\n\u2022\ncommunications failures;\n\u2022\nsoftware and hardware errors, failures and crashes;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches, computer viruses, hacking, denial-of-service attacks and similar disruptive problems; and\n\u2022\nother potential interruptions.\nWe also rely on purchased or leased computer hardware and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services. These licenses are generally commercially available on varying terms. However, it is possible that this hardware and software might not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated.\nWe exercise limited control over third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with technology and information services they provide. Interruptions in our network access and services might in connection with third-party technology and information services reduce our revenue, cause us to issue refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services, subject us to potential liability, or adversely affect our renewal rates. Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. In addition, we might not be able to continue to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost, if at all.\nIf our security measures are breached or fail, and unauthorized persons gain access to customers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 data, our products and services might be perceived as being unsecure, customers and consumers might curtail or stop using our products and services, and we might incur significant liabilities.\nOur products and services involve the collection, processing, storage and transmission of customers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 confidential information, which may include sensitive individually identifiable information that is subject to stringent statutory and regulatory obligations. Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of our software and applications are very important. From time to time we may detect vulnerabilities in our systems, which, even if they do not result in a security breach, may reduce customer confidence and require substantial resources to address. If our security measures or those of our third-party service providers are breached or fail and/or are bypassed as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, someone might be able to obtain unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 confidential information and/or patient data. As a result, our reputation could be damaged, our business might suffer, and we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and significant costs for remediation efforts to prevent future occurrences.\nIn addition, we rely on various third parties, including health plans, brokers and other third-party service providers and consumers themselves, as users of our system, for key activities to protect and promote the security of our systems and the data and information accessible within them, such as enrollment information, consumer status changes and payment. On occasion, certain individuals have failed to perform these activities. For example, authorized users have failed to administer and use the login/password appropriately, which may allow the system to be accessed by unauthorized third parties. When we become aware of such breaches or incidents, we work with our customers to remedy the issue, terminate inappropriate access as necessary, and provide additional instruction in order to avoid the reoccurrence of such problems. Although to date these breaches have not resulted in claims against us or in material harm to our business, failures to perform these activities might result in claims against us, which could expose us to significant expense, legal liability, and harm to our reputation, which might result in loss of business.\nOur security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain, including payment card systems which may subject us to fines or higher transaction fees or limit or terminate our access to certain payment methods. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we and our hosting service providers might not be able to detect or prevent these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures until after the techniques or other attacks\nhave already been launched. If an actual or perceived breach of our security or that of our hosting service providers occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. In addition, our customers might authorize or enable third parties to access their information and data that is stored on our systems. Because we do not control such access, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such data in our systems.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the risks associated with a failure by us to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy, identity theft prevention and detection and data security, see the risk factor below under \u201c-Risks Related to Regulation-The healthcare and health insurance industries are heavily regulated. Our failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business.\u201d\nVarious events could interrupt customers\u2019 access to our platform, exposing us to significant costs.\nThe ability to access our platform is critical to our customers. Our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (i) power loss and telecommunications failures, (ii) fire, flood, hurricane, and other natural disasters, (iii) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes in our own systems or in other systems, (iv) computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, hacking and similar disruptive problems in our own systems and in other systems, and (v) civil unrest, war, and/or terrorism. We have implemented various measures to protect against interruptions of customers\u2019 access to our platform. If customers\u2019 access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims by customers. Our plans for disaster recovery and business continuity rely on third-party providers of related services. If those vendors fail us at a time when our systems are not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our obligations. Any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to retain customers and sell our services, which would adversely impact our revenue.\nBecause we recognize revenue and expense relating to delivery of software, transaction fees and professional services over varying periods, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nWe recognize recurring revenue monthly over the term of our contracts and recognize the majority of our professional services revenue ratably over the contract term or the estimated period of customer benefit, whichever is longer. As a result, a portion of the revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from contracts we entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a shortfall in demand for our software solutions and professional services or a decline in new or renewed contracts in any one quarter might not significantly reduce our revenue for that quarter, but could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our products and services is not reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods. Our revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, because revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable term of the contracts or the estimated period of customer benefit, whichever is longer. An increasing number of our client arrangements include variable transaction based fees that are dependent on market conditions and our customers\u2019 success in using our software services to transact annual insurance enrollments. The amount of revenue from such arrangements largely occurs in the fourth quarter of each calendar year in conjunction with the traditional annual health insurance renewal cycles of our customers. In addition, we recognize professional services expenses as incurred, which could cause professional services gross margin to be negative.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and deferred implementation costs. We may need to record write-downs from future impairments of these assets, which could adversely affect our costs and business operations.\nOur consolidated balance sheet includes significant goodwill, intangible assets and deferred implementation costs, including $31.1 million in goodwill, $9.2 million in other intangible assets and $23.3 million of deferred implementation costs, together representing approximately 77.0% of our total assets as of December 31, 2016. The determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments and our ability to accurately predict future cash flows related to these intangible assets may not be accurate. We test our goodwill for impairment each fiscal year, but we also test goodwill, other intangible assets and deferred implementation costs for impairment at any time when there is a change in circumstances that indicates that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired. Any future determination that these assets are carried at greater than their fair value could result in substantial non-cash impairment charges, which could significantly impact our reported operating results.\nOur estimate of the market size for our solutions may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market size is accurate, we cannot assure you that our business will serve a significant portion of the market.\nOur estimate of the market size for our solutions is subject to significant uncertainty and is based on assumptions and estimates, including our internal analysis and industry experience, which may not prove to be accurate. Our ability to serve a significant portion of this estimated market is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to\nmany risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, even if our estimate of the market size is accurate, we cannot assure you that our business will serve a significant portion of this estimated market for our solutions.\nWe might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or other tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our future operating cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2020. These carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our future operating cash flows.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their collective ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules might apply under state tax laws. As a result of prior equity issuances and other transactions in our stock, we have experienced \u201cownership changes\u201d under Section 382 which limit the amount of net operating losses available to us. Future issuances and other transactions in our stock may cause an additional \u201cownership change.\u201d Accordingly, the application of Section 382 could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our future operating cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards, because we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of these deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOur government business relies on working effectively with the prime contractors that hold the contract with the government customers and those contracts being renewed or extended, as applicable. To the extent those relationships are not positively maintained or such contracts, such as our subcontract in connection with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, contract, are not renewed or extended, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn our government business to date, we have primarily worked as a subcontractor to prime contractors that contract directly with the federal or state government customer. In the scope of these relationships, we have provided specified components of the applicable government entity\u2019s overall request. Based on our risk analysis of multiple factors, including the scope of the government entity\u2019s request, the total potential contract value and the terms and conditions of the applicable contract, we have determined that operating in a subcontractor role has been most appropriate for our government business. It may or may not be more beneficial for us to contract directly with the government due to various factors including insurance, risk and liability issues. In order to secure government business, it is important that we identify and market our capabilities to the prime contractor community, participate on joint requests for proposals, and maintain effective working relationships throughout the term of the contract.\nIn many cases, payment for our products and services is dependent upon the prime contractor getting paid by the government customer. As such, we may not be paid on a timely basis or at all if the prime contractor or other subcontractors have not completed their work.\nWe use staff contracting firms located internationally or that source their resources from outside the United States to augment our employee base and assist in the development, distribution and delivery of our solutions. Future work with these firms might expose us to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe use staff contracting firms (both onshore and offshore) to scale up or down based on customer needs, work across various time zones to meet speed to market requirements, and lower our total cost of delivery. For over ten years, we have used staff contracting firms with employees located internationally. Associated risks include:\n\u2022\noperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and might subject us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those in the United States, including data privacy and security considerations;\n\u2022\nability of our vendor firms to continue to identify and staff local talent that meets our quality and turnaround requirements;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations which raises the price of offshore labor and does not allow us to obtain cost efficiencies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in working with firms that staff and manage foreign operations;\n\u2022\nweaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nunstable regional economic and political conditions.\nIn addition, our customers may require us to staff projects with only employed or domestically-based staff. That requirement could increase our cost of delivery, which in turn could decrease our competiveness and lower our overall profitability.\nAny future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes or employment claims made by our current or former employees. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results. We generally intend to defend ourselves vigorously; however, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance, which could reduce the trading price of our stock. Additionally, certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured and adversely impact our ability to attract officers and directors.\nWe might be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, and intellectual property claims against us could result in the loss of significant rights. Even if we are successful in enforcing our intellectual property rights, we may incur significant costs in doing so, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights, as well as customary contractual protections. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technologies and software applications. We also rely on intellectual property licensed from third parties. Our attempts to protect our intellectual property might be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products or services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours, each of which could materially harm our business.\nFrom time to time, third parties have alleged, and may allege in the future that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are forced to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, regardless of the merit or ultimate result of such claims, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel, limitations on our ability to market or provide our products and services. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to:\n\u2022\ndevelop non-infringing technology;\n\u2022\npay damages or refund fees;\n\u2022\nenter into or modify royalty or licensing agreements;\n\u2022\ncease providing certain products or services; or\n\u2022\ntake other actions to resolve the claims.\nMoreover, if we are unable to implement one or more of the remedial actions described above, we may be prevented from continuing to offer, and our customers may be prevented from continuing to use, any of our affected products or services.\nThe use of open source software in our products and solutions may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights.\nSome of our products and solutions use or incorporate software that is subject to one or more open source licenses. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable, and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user\u2019s software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user\u2019s software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on potentially unfavorable terms or at no cost.\nThe terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by United States or foreign courts. Accordingly, there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. In that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products or solutions, to re-develop our products or solutions, to discontinue sales of our products or solutions, or to release our proprietary software code under the terms of an open source license, any of which could harm our business. Further, given the nature of open source software, it may be more likely that third parties might assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of these open source software programs.\nWhile we monitor the use of all open source software in our products, solutions, processes, and technology and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product or solution when we do not wish to do so, it is possible that such use may have inadvertently occurred in deploying our proprietary solutions. In addition, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our products and solutions without our knowledge, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our products and solutions. This could harm our intellectual property position and our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur confidentiality arrangements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, and any such disclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have devoted substantial resources to the development of our technology, business operations and business plans. In order to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, we rely in significant part on confidentiality arrangements with our employees, independent contractors, advisers and customers. These arrangements may not be effective to prevent disclosure of confidential information, including trade secrets, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we would not be able to assert trade secret rights against such parties. The loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products and services by copying functionality. In addition, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade secret and other intellectual property laws may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we acquire companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock.\nAs part of our business strategy, we might acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or make investments in complementary companies, services, and technologies in the future. For example, in 2016, we acquired ConnectedHealth, LLC. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in identifying and acquiring products, technologies or businesses that will help our business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nrisk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience; and\n\u2022\ndelays in customer purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses.\nIf we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, we might incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention might be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nConsolidation in the health insurance industry in which our customers operate could cause us to lose customers or could reduce the volume of services purchased by consolidated customers following an acquisition or merger, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nConsolidation in the health insurance industry has accelerated in recent years, and this trend could continue. We may lose customers due to industry consolidation, and we may not be able to expand sales of our solutions and services to new customers to replace lost customers. In addition, new companies or organizations that result from such consolidation may decide that our solutions are no longer needed because of their own internal processes or the use of alternative solutions. As these entities consolidate, competition to provide solutions and services to industry participants will become more intense and the importance of establishing relationships with large industry participants will become greater. These industry participants may try to use their market power to\nnegotiate price reductions for our solutions. Also, if consolidation of larger current customers occurs, the combined company may represent a larger percentage of business for us and, as a result, we are likely to rely more significantly on the combined company\u2019s revenue to achieve growth. As a result, industry consolidation or consolidation among current customers or potential customers could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more key personnel or an inability to attract hire, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of key personnel. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, marketing, services, and general and administrative functions, and on mission-critical individual contributors in research and development. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could have a serious adverse effect on our business. The replacement of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees would involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nTo continue to execute our strategy, we also must identify, hire and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition is intense for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services. We might not be successful in maintaining our unique culture and continuing to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled personnel with appropriate qualifications. The pool of qualified personnel is limited overall and specifically in the geographic regions in which our principal offices are located. Failure to identify, hire and retain necessary key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumers of health insurance are increasingly relying on mobile devices as part of their decision-making process. If we are unsuccessful in expanding the capabilities of our shopping tools for mobile platforms, it could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that consumers of health insurance are increasingly relying on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, in connection with their health insurance purchasing decisions. Traditionally, our solutions have been designed for desktop platforms, and we must develop new capabilities to deliver compelling user experiences via mobile devices. To deliver high quality mobile offerings, it is important that our solutions integrate with a wide range of other mobile technologies, systems, networks and standards that we do not control. We may not be successful in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks or standards. Further, our success on mobile platforms will be dependent on our interoperability with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as Android, iOS and Windows Mobile, and any change in such systems that degrade our functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect usage of our solutions through mobile devices. If we fail to achieve success with our mobile offerings, our ability to deliver compelling user experiences to consumers as they increasingly rely on mobile devices in connection with their health insurance purchasing decisions will be constrained and our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot maintain or enhance our corporate culture, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success has been our corporate culture. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. We may find it difficult to maintain the innovation, teamwork, passion and focus on execution that we believe are important aspects of our corporate culture. Failure to enhance or preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nFailure by our customers to obtain proper permissions and waivers might result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe require our customers to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of information on our platform, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so. If, however, despite these requirements and contractual obligations, our customers do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf might be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws. This could impair our functions, processes and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and might prevent use of such data. In addition, this could interfere with, or prevent creation or use of, rules, analyses, or other data-driven activities that benefit us and our business. Moreover, we might be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notices, agreements, permissions or waivers. These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are required to collect sales and use taxes in additional jurisdictions, we might be subject to liability for additional sales and use taxes and our future sales may decrease.\nWe might incur significant expenses, and, as a result, lose sales, if states successfully impose broader guidelines on state sales and use taxes or successfully argue that current guidelines apply to us. We currently collect sales and use tax in a limited number of states. A successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect sales or other taxes on the licensing of our software or sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past transactions and otherwise harm our business. Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that change over time. We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe we are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, voluntarily engage with state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related interest and penalties for past sales or use taxes in states where we currently believe no such taxes are required.\nVendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes. If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we might be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward. Liability for past taxes might also include substantial interest and penalty charges. Our customer contracts typically provide that our customers must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes. Nevertheless, our customers might be reluctant to pay back taxes and might refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our customers fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts (or if we decline to seek reimbursement from our clients), we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on us going forward will effectively increase the cost of our software and services to our customers and might adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new customers in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nThe healthcare and health insurance industries are heavily regulated. Our failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business.\nThe healthcare and health insurance industries are highly regulated and are subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Existing and new laws and regulations could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs and restrict our operations. These laws and regulations are complex and their application to specific services and relationships are not clear. In particular, many existing laws and regulations affecting healthcare and health insurance and related benefits or products when enacted, did not anticipate the services that we provide, and these laws and regulations might be applied to our services in ways that we do not anticipate. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply, could require us to change our operations or cease using certain datasets, create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business. Some of the risks we face from the regulation of healthcare and health insurance are as follows:\n\u2022\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Numerous lawsuits have challenged and continue to challenge the constitutionality and other aspects of PPACA, and regulations and regulatory guidance continue to be issued on various aspects of PPACA. Additionally, administrative changes as a result of the 2016 fall elections could impact aspects of PPACA, and in turn may affect our business. While many of the provisions of PPACA are not directly applicable to us, PPACA, as enacted, affects the business of many of our customers. Our customers might experience changes in the numbers of individuals they insure as a result of Medicaid expansion and the creation of state and national exchanges. Although we are unable to predict with any reasonable certainty or otherwise quantify the likely impact of PPACA on our business model, financial condition, or results of operations, changes in the business of our customers and the number of individuals they insure may negatively impact our business.\n\u2022\nHIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements. There are numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal health information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, established privacy and security standards, or Privacy Standards and Security Standards, that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and most providers are considered by the HIPAA regulations to be \u201cCovered Entities.\u201d With respect to our operations, we are a Business Associate of our health plan customers and we are directly subject to the privacy and security regulations established under HIPAA. We enter into written Business Associate Agreements with our health plan customers, under which we are required to safeguard individually identifiable health information and comply with restrictions how we may use and disclose such information. Effective February 2010, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, and effective March 2013, the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rules extended the direct application of certain provisions of the Privacy Standards and Security Standards to us when we are functioning as a\nBusiness Associate of our health plan customers. ARRA and the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule also subject Business Associates to direct oversight and audit by the HHS.\nViolations of the Privacy Standards and Security Standards might result in civil and criminal penalties, and ARRA increased the penalties for HIPAA violations and strengthened the enforcement provisions of HIPAA. For example, ARRA authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of Privacy Standards and Security Standards that threaten the privacy of state residents. Additionally, some health plans interpret HIPAA requirements differently than we do, and as our customers are the Covered Entity under HIPAA we may be required to comply with their interpretations.\nWe might not be able to adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA implementation. Furthermore, we are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance.\nIn addition to the Privacy Standards and Security Standards, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical and/or health information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements. Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements and we are required to comply with them. Additionally, other laws or standards may apply to our operations, including requirements related to handling certain financial information, federal tax information, or FTI, and payment card association operating rules with respect to credit card data.\nFailure by us to comply with any state standards regarding patient privacy may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties. Such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain customers and attract new customers.\n\u2022\nInsurance Broker Laws. Insurance laws in the United States are often complex, and states have broad authority to adopt regulations regarding brokerage activities. These regulations typically include the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and govern the handling and investment of customer funds held in a fiduciary capacity. We and our broker/agency customers may be subject to some of these regulations, and may not be able to fully comply.\n\u2022\nMedicare and Medicaid Regulatory Requirements. We have contracts with health plans that offer Medicare Managed Care (also known as Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part C). We also have contracts with health plans that offer Medicare prescription drug benefits (also known as Medicare Part D) plans. The activities of the Medicare plans are regulated by CMS. Though our health plan customers remain responsible to comply with CMS requirements, we operate as a First Tier, Downstream & Related Entity, or FDR, in support of our customers. Some of the activities that we might perform, such as the enrollment of beneficiaries, may be subject to CMS and/or state regulation, and such regulations may force us to change the way we do business or otherwise restrict our ability to provide services to such plans. Moreover, the regulatory environment with respect to these programs has become, and will likely continue to become, increasingly complex.\n\u2022\nFinancial Services-Related Laws and Rules. Financial services and electronic payment processing services are subject to numerous laws, regulations and industry standards, some of which might impact our operations and subject us, our vendors, and our customers to liability as a result of the payment distribution and processing solutions we offer. In addition, payment distribution and processing solutions might be impacted by payment card association operating rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. If we fail to comply with applicable payment processing rules or requirements, we might be subject to fines and changes in transaction fees and may lose our ability to process credit and debit card transactions or facilitate other types of billing and payment solutions. Moreover, payment transactions processed using the Automated Clearing House Network, or ACH, are subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association and to various federal laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic funds transfers, and these rules and laws might impact our billing and payment solutions. Further, our solutions might impact the ability of our payer customers to comply with state prompt payment laws. These laws require payers to pay healthcare claims meeting the statutory or regulatory definition of a \u201cclean claim\u201d within a specified time frame.\n\u2022\nFalse or Fraudulent Claim Laws. There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information or the failure to disclose information in connection with submission and payment of claims for reimbursement from the government. In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse of existing systems for such submission and payment. Any contract we have with a government entity or in support of a government entity requires us to comply with these laws and regulations. Any failure of our services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability, including but not limited to criminal liability, could adversely affect demand for our services, and could force us to expend significant capital, research and development, and other resources to address the failure. Any determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services with government customers violate these laws and regulations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our government customer contracts, require us to\nchange or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving not only government customers but also all customers doing business with government payers, and have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022\nERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, regulates how employee benefits are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefits plans. ERISA is a set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the United States Department of Labor as well as the federal courts. In some circumstances, and under certain customer contracts, we might be deemed to have assumed duties that make us an ERISA fiduciary, and thus be required to carry out our operations in a manner that complies with ERISA in all material respects. Our current operations may render us subject to ERISA fiduciary obligations, and while we believe we are in compliance with ERISA and that any such compliance does not currently have a material adverse effect on our operations, there can be no assurance that continuing ERISA compliance efforts or any future changes to ERISA will not have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nThird-Party Administrator Laws. Numerous states in which we do business have adopted regulations governing entities engaged in third-party administrator, or TPA, activities. TPA regulations typically impose requirements regarding enrollment into benefits plans, claims processing and payments, and the handling of customer funds. Additions to our service offerings and/or changes in state regulations could result in us being obligated to comply with such regulations, which might require us to obtain licenses to provide TPA services in such states.\nThe growth in the Medicare plan market is important to the overall growth rate of our business. The marketing and sale of Medicare plans are subject to numerous, complex and frequently changing laws and regulations, and the impact of changes in laws related to Medicare or any failure to comply with them could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe number of people eligible for Medicare is one of the most significant drivers in the growth of Medicare plans. Any changes in the eligibility requirements for Medicare such as raising the age of eligibility would decrease the available pool of recipients and lower our growth expectations.\nThe marketing and sale of Medicare plans are subject to numerous laws, regulations and guidelines at both the Federal and state level. The marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans are principally regulated by CMS, which is a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and the marketing and sale of Medicare supplement plans is principally regulated on a state- by- state basis by state departments of insurance. The laws and regulations applicable to the marketing and sale of Medicare plans lack clarity, are numerous and complex, were not drafted to contemplate health insurance exchanges, and change frequently, particularly with respect to regulations and guidance issued by CMS for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans and by the various state departments of insurance for Medicare supplement plans.\nAs a result of these laws, regulations and guidelines, we have altered, and will need to continue to alter, our business operations and procedures, including without limitation, to comply with these changing requirements. Though our health plan customers remain responsible to comply with CMS requirements, we operate as an FDR, in support of our customers. Changes to the laws, regulations and guidelines relating to Medicare plans, the scope of their application to our business, their interpretation by regulators or our health plan customers, or the manner in which they are enforced could be incompatible with our business model. As a result, our business could be slowed or we could be prevented from operating portions of our business altogether, either of which would materially harm our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if this occurred during the Medicare annual enrollment period, which is when the vast majority of Medicare plans are sold.\nHealth plans may adjust their commission rates to comply with regulatory guidelines, such as those published by CMS with respect to the marketing of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. If these contractual changes result in reduced commissions, our revenue may decline. Because insurance rates may vary between health plans, plans and enrollment dates, changes in enrollment mix may impact our commission revenue. Future changes in health plan pricing practices could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn March 2010, the Federal government enacted significant reforms to healthcare legislation through the PPACA and the HCERA, which we refer to collectively as Healthcare Reform. In addition, one of the elements of the Budget Control Act of 2011 is the creation of a joint select committee on deficit reduction to develop recommendations, including changes to entitlement programs such as Medicare, to reduce the national debt by at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years. In connection with the United Sates Congress\u2019s failure to agree on a proposal to lower the national deficit, the Budget Control Act mandates automatic cuts to domestic and defense spending, including a significant reduction in Medicare spending. The impact that Healthcare Reform and the Budget Control Act will have on the market for Medicare plans could change the demand for Medicare plans, the way these plans are delivered, or the commissions that health plans pay to us in connection with their sale or otherwise adversely impact us.\nIn the event that these laws and regulations or changes in these laws and regulations, or other laws and regulations that impact the marketing and sale of Medicare plans, adversely impact our ability or our customers\u2019 ability to market any type of Medicare plan on an exchange platform or the commissions that we receive for selling these plans, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.\nAdditional regulatory requirements placed on our software, services, and content could impose increased costs on us, delay or prevent our introduction of new service types, and impair the function or value of our existing service types.\nOur products and services are and are likely to continue to be subject to increasing regulatory requirements in a number of ways. As these requirements proliferate, we must change or adapt our products and services to comply. Changing regulatory requirements might render our services obsolete or might prevent us from pursuing our business objective or developing new services. This might in turn impose additional costs upon us to comply or to further develop our products and services. It might also make introduction of new product or service types more costly or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate. It might even prevent introduction by us of new products or services or cause the continuation of our existing products or services to become unprofitable or impossible.\nPotential government subsidy of services similar to ours, or creation of a single-payer system, might reduce customer demand.\nRecently, entities including brokers and United States federal and state governments have offered to subsidize adoption of online benefits platforms or clearinghouses. In addition, prior proposals regarding healthcare reform have included the concept of creation of a single payer for health insurance. This kind of consolidation of critical benefits activity could negatively impact the demand for our services.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the risk factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other factors which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, business plans, or commercial relationships;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations relating to the sale of health insurance;\n\u2022\nany major change in our Board of Directors or management;\n\u2022\nthe significant ownership position controlled by a limited number of stockholders;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports or news stories about us, our competitors, or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nlarge volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFrancisco Partners controls a majority of our voting securities, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to influence corporate matters and may give rise to conflicts of interest.\nOn May 2, 2016, we completed the sale of 52,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Financing\u201d) pursuant to an Investment Agreement, dated March 11, 2016, as amended, by and among the Company, Francisco Partners IV, L.P. and Francisco Partners IV-A, L.P. (together, \u201cFrancisco Partners\u201d) and Chrysalis Ventures II, L.P. (\u201cChrysalis\u201d). As of December 31, 2016, Francisco Partners beneficially owned approximately 43% of our outstanding capital stock on an as-converted basis by virtue of\nits ownership of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and shares of our common stock it purchased in market transactions. On March 10, 2017, we completed the sale of 17,500 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Financing\u201d) pursuant to an Investment Agreement, dated March 10, 2017, by and among the Company, Francisco Partners and Chrysalis. As a result of that purchase, Francisco Partners owned, as of the closing of the Series B Financing, approximately 56% of our outstanding capital stock on an as-converted basis. Subject to certain protective provisions applicable to our Preferred Stock, shares of our outstanding common stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock vote together on an as-converted basis, meaning that Francisco Partners controlled approximately 56% of our voting securities as of March 10, 2017. In addition, under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement entered into with Francisco Partners in connection with the closing of the Series B Financing, for so long as Francisco Partners owns at least 10% of the aggregate shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and common stock that it held as of March 10, 2017, it can: (i) for so long as it holds at least 5% of the aggregate outstanding securities of the Company (on an as-converted basis), designate a proportionate share of our Board of Directors based upon its percentage ownership of the Company\u2019s outstanding securities on an as-converted basis, rounded up to the nearest whole director, which designees are entitled to serve on each committee of the Board, subject to applicable legal and NASDAQ requirements, and (ii) if no director designated by Francisco Partners is serving on the Board, designate one Board observer. As of the closing of the Series B Financing, Francisco Partners had one designee serving on our Board of Directors and one vacancy existed, which vacancy will be filled by Francisco Partners.\nIn addition, Francisco Partners, as the controlling shareholder of both our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock, must consent before we take certain corporate actions, including:\n\u2022\namending our organizational documents in a manner that would have an adverse effect on the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nissuing securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock; and\n\u2022\nincurring indebtedness other than in the ordinary course of business or from our existing senior secured lender, Wells Fargo, up to the maximum amount authorized as of March 10, 2017.\nAccordingly, Francisco Partners may be able to exert significant influence over us and any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock, including the election of directors, the amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. Furthermore, the interests of Francisco Partners may not be aligned with our other stockholders, which could lead to actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders. Francisco Partners and its affiliates are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business, and they may have interests that diverge from, or even conflict with, those of our other stockholders. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Francisco Partner\u2019s significant ownership in us may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from making a significant equity investment in us, or could discourage, delay or prevent transactions involving a change in control, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market price. Likewise, Francisco Partners\u2019 ability to prevent our acceptance of any senior equity or indebtedness other than in the ordinary course of business or from Wells Fargo under our existing credit facility, may make it more difficult for us to secure additional capital in the future if needed, which could significantly limit our ability to continue to support our business and to respond to business challenges.\nIn addition, as of March 10, 2017, Chrysalis beneficially owned approximately 11% of our outstanding capital stock on an as-converted basis. Chrysalis has a representative, David A. Jones, Jr., that serves on our Board of Directors as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Collectively, as of March 10, 2017, our directors, executive officers, and their affiliated entities beneficially owned approximately 68% of our outstanding capital stock on an as-converted basis. These stockholders, if they act together, could exert substantial influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions, which may further discourage, delay or prevent a third party from making a significant equity investment in us, or could discourage, delay or prevent transactions involving a change in control, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market price.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, qualify for, and may rely on certain of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemptions from certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, which could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nUnder NASDAQ rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements. As a result of its purchase of Series B Preferred Stock, Francisco Partners holds approximately 56% of the voting power of our outstanding securities. As such we are eligible to take advantage of this \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption and intend to elect to\ndo so. A \u201ccontrolled company\u201d may elect not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that (i) a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (ii) compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and (iii) director nominees be selected or recommended by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. We intend to take advantage of certain of these \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemptions, particularly with respect the compensation of our officers and the election of director nominees. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements and as a result, our common stock may be less attractive to some investors or otherwise harmed. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nThe issuance of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, dilutes the ownership of such holders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 7.5% per annum (subject to adjustment), payable quarterly in arrears. The dividends are to be paid in-kind, through an increase in the number of shares of common stock into which shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible, through at least May 2, 2018, and thereafter in cash or in-kind at our option. Upon the occurrence of certain events, the dividend rate will increase. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 15% per annum (subject to adjustment), payable quarterly in arrears. The dividends are to be paid in-kind, through an increase in the number of shares of common stock into which shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible, through at least March 10, 2019, and thereafter in cash or in-kind at our option. Upon the occurrence of certain events, the dividend rate will increase.\nAs of the closing of the Series B Financing, the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock represented approximately 20% of our outstanding capital stock, on an as-converted basis and the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented approximately 31% of our outstanding capital stock, on an as-converted basis (which includes the effect of an adjustment to the conversion ratio of the Series A Preferred Stock that occurred as a result of the Series B Financing and pursuant to the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock). Francisco Partners holds approximately 95% of such shares of Preferred Stock. As holders of our Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, the issuance of the Preferred Stock, and the subsequent increase in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock through the payment of dividends, effectively reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock.\nIn addition, the conversion of the Preferred Stock to common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We granted the holders of the Preferred Stock customary registration rights in respect of their shares of Preferred Stock, and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. We registered all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the number of shares of common stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be convertible as of May 3, 2018 on a Registration Statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on September 23, 2016. A registration statement with respect to the registration of the Series B Preferred Stock will be filed with the SEC within 120 days of the closing of the Series B Financing. The registration statements for the Preferred Stock will facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales by the holders of our Preferred Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and may result in the interests of the holders of our Preferred Stock differing from those of our common stockholders.\nThe holders of Preferred Stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets available for distribution to stockholders before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock, an amount equal to the greater of the stated value of such holder\u2019s shares of Preferred Stock or the amount that such holder would have been entitled to receive upon our liquidation, dissolution and winding up if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, plus accrued but unpaid dividends.\nIn addition, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock accrue and are cumulative at the rate of 7.5% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears and on the Series B Preferred Stock at the rate of 15% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. Upon the occurrence of certain events, the dividend rate for each series of Preferred Stock will increase. The dividends are to be paid in-kind,\nthrough an increase in the number of shares of common stock into which shares of Preferred Stock are convertible, until May 2, 2018 with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and March 10, 2019 with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, and thereafter in cash or in-kind at our option. The holders of our Preferred Stock also have certain redemption rights, including the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain events.\nThese dividend and share repurchase obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of Preferred Stock, including the requirement that we obtain the consent of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock prior to incurring additional indebtedness other than in the ordinary course or pursuant to our current arrangements with Wells Fargo, could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the holders of shares of Preferred Stock and holders of our common stock. In addition to Ezra Perlman, who serves as a director at the designation of Francisco Partners, David A. Jones, Jr., the chairman of our Board of Directors, is affiliated with Chrysalis, which in addition to holding shares of our common stock, also holds shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the fact that all directors are subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law, the interests of the directors designated by Francisco Partners and of Mr. Jones may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock, to some extent, depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or change their opinion of our common stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth strategy. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon future appreciation in its value, if any. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders purchased their shares.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions might also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to cumulate votes at any election of directors;\n\u2022\nthe classification of our Board of Directors into three classes with only one class, representing approximately one-third of our directors, standing for election at each annual meeting; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.\nOur Board of Directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or\nwithin the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nWe currently qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, and exemptions from the requirements of auditor attestation reports on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(B)(1), which will allow us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) ending December 31, 2019, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we become a large accelerated filer, which means that we have been public for at least 12 months, have filed at least one annual report and the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our then most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.", "PERMNO": 15126, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CNXR"}
