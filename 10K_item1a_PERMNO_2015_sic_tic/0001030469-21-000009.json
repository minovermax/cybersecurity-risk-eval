RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as updated by other filings Oriental makes with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us at this time or that Oriental currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect Oriental\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS RISK\nMost of our business is conducted in Puerto Rico, whose economic and government fiscal and liquidity challenges, as well as the impact of two major hurricanes in 2017 and earthquakes and a pandemic in 2020, have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us.\nOur business is directly affected by economic conditions within Puerto Rico. A significant portion of our credit risk exposure on our loan portfolio is concentrated in Puerto Rico. Such, our profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected by an extended economic recession, adverse political, fiscal or economic developments in Puerto Rico, or the effects of natural disasters, all of which could result in a reduction in loan originations, an increase in credit losses and a reduction in the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio.\nIn the past decades, Puerto Rico has experienced a significant economic contraction that began in 2006; a government fiscal crisis that led to the appointment of a federal oversight board in 2016 and a bankruptcy type restructuring process of the government\u2019s finances; and various significant natural disasters, hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017 and a series of earthquakes primarily affecting the southwest region of the island in January 2020, and the Covid-19 pandemic throughout 2020 and in 2021. Although federal assistance for recovering from the natural disasters and insurance recoveries are expected to drive economic growth in the short term, there is no guarantee that funds set aside for these purposes will not be repurposed by the federal government or that their disbursement will not be unreasonably conditioned or delayed. In addition, there is no assurance that the government will be able to satisfy its obligations as they may be restructured. Puerto Rico also continues to be vulnerable to hurricanes and earthquakes and may be impacted by future natural disasters. Furthermore, the government fiscal crisis may limit the ability of the Puerto Rico government to respond effectively to future disasters.\nDeterioration in local economic conditions or in the financial condition of an industry on which the local market depends could adversely affect factors such as unemployment rates and real estate vacancy and values. This could result in, among other things, a reduction of creditworthy borrowers seeking loans, an increase in loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, an increase in classified and non-accrual loans, a decrease in the value of collateral for loans, and a decrease in core deposits. Any of these factors could materially impact our business.\nPuerto Rico and the USVI are susceptible to earthquakes, hurricanes and major storms, which could further deteriorate their economy and infrastructure.\nOur branch network and business is concentrated in Puerto Rico and the USVI, which are susceptible to earthquakes, hurricanes and major storms that affect the local economy and the demand for our loans and financial services, as well as the ability of our customers to repay their loans. Any such natural disasters may further adversely affect Puerto Rico\u2019s and the USVI\u2019s critical infrastructure, which are generally weak. This makes us vulnerable to downturns in Puerto Rico\u2019s and the USVI\u2019s economy as a result of natural disasters, such as recent earthquakes in 2020 and hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. Any subsequent earthquakes, hurricanes, major storms or other disasters, such as pandemics, could further deteriorate Puerto Rico\u2019s and USVI\u2019s economy and infrastructure and negatively affect or disrupt our operations and customer base.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business and financial results, and the extent to which the pandemic and measures taken in response to the pandemic could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\nGlobal health concerns relating to the Covid-19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have impacted the macroeconomic environment, significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. The pandemic has also caused governmental authorities to implement numerous measures to try to contain the virus, including travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. These measures have negatively impacted and may further negatively impact consumer and business payment and spending patterns.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition, capital and results of operations. The extent of these impacts depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and magnitude of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, the effectiveness of economic stimulus measures in Puerto Rico and the United States, and how quickly and to what extent economic and operating conditions and consumer and business spending can return to their pre-pandemic levels. Until vaccine is widely distributed, we expect business conditions to remain challenging. As a result, our loan growth and the overall demand for our products and services may be significantly impacted, which could adversely affect our revenue and other results of operations. In addition, we could experience higher credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses. For example, as a result of the significant uncertainty due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we realized a substantial build in our allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020. Oriental\u2019s interest income could also be reduced due to Covid-19. Interest and fees still accrue on amounts that are deemed collectible during the deferral period; however, should Oriental later determine that collection of payments is not expected and eventual credit losses on these deferred payments emerge, accrued and unpaid interest income and fees will need to be reversed. In such a scenario, interest income in future periods could be negatively impacted. At December 31, 2020, Oriental has established an allowance for credit losses on this accrued interest receivable amounting to $711 thousand. We could also experience impairments of other financial assets and other negative impacts on our financial position, including possible constraints on liquidity and capital, as well as higher costs of capital. Even after the Covid-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business and results of operations, which could be material, as a result of the macroeconomic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThe spread of Covid-19 has caused us to modify our business practices and operations, including providing forbearance options to our customers in certain circumstances. We may need to further modify our practices and operations as this event unfolds. We have also implemented work-from-home policies for approximately 50% of our employees, and social distancing plans for our employees who are working from Oriental\u2019s facilities. These measures could impair our ability to perform critical functions and may adversely impact our results of operations. We may take further actions as required by government authorities or that we otherwise determine are in the best interests of our customers, employees and business partners.\nFederal, state, and local governmental authorities have enacted, and may enact in the future, legislation, regulations and protocols in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including governmental programs intended to provide economic relief to businesses and individuals. Our participation in and execution of any such programs may cause operational, compliance, reputational and credit risks, which could result in litigation, governmental action or other forms of loss. The extent of these impacts, which may be substantial, will depend on the degree of our participation in these programs. There remains significant uncertainty regarding the measures that authorities will enact in the future and the ultimate impact of the legislation, regulations and protocols that have been and will be enacted.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce Oriental\u2019s net interest income\nMarket risk refers to the probability of variations in the net interest income or the fair value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or equity prices.\nChanges in interest rates are one of the principal market risks affecting us. Our earnings are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans, investment securities and cash, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Depending on the duration and repricing characteristics of the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, changes in interest rates could either increase or decrease the level of net interest income. For any given period, the pricing structure of the assets and liabilities is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities mature or reprice in that period. Like all financial institutions, our financial position is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Volatility in interest rates can also result in the flow of funds away from financial institutions. We may suffer losses or experience lower spreads than anticipated if we are not effective in managing our interest rate risk.\nOur business is susceptible to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. Reforms to and uncertainty regarding the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next several years.\nOn April 3, 2018, the Federal Reserve began publishing three new reference rates, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) has recommended SOFR as the alternative to USD LIBOR and published fallback interest rate consultations for public comment as well as a Paced Transition Plan to SOFR use. The Financial Stability Board has taken an interest in LIBOR and possible replacement indices as a matter of risk management. The International Organization of Securities Commissions, or IOSCO, has been active in this area and is expected to call on market participants to have backup options if a reference rate, such as LIBOR, ceases publication. The International Swap Dealers Association has published guidance on interest rate benchmarks and alternatives in July and August 2018.\nOn November 30th, 2020 the federal banking regulatory agencies issued an Interagency Statement on LIBOR Transition to encourage banks to transition away from U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR as soon as practicable. The Statement exposes that the LIBOR transition is a significant event that banks should closely manage and further explains that new financial contracts should either utilize a reference rate other than LIBOR or have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after LIBOR\u2019s discontinuation. Separately, the agencies recently issued a statement that says a bank may use any reference rate for its loans that the bank determines to be appropriate for its funding model and customer needs.\nThe key aspect of such Statement is that the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. This extension allows most USD LIBOR contracts to mature before LIBOR experiences disruptions. Failure to prepare for disruptions to USD LIBOR, including operating with insufficiently robust fallback language, could undermine financial stability and banks\u2019 safety and soundness. The statement does go on to clearly specify that it should not be read as announcing that the LIBOR benchmark has ceased, or will cease, to be provided permanently or indefinitely or that it is not, or no longer will be, representative for the purposes of language adopted by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (\u201cISDA\u201d). Recently, ISDA launched the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement and IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, marking a major step in reducing the systemic impact of a key interbank offered rate becoming unavailable while market participants continue to have exposure to that rate. The supplement amends ISDA\u2019s standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to incorporate robust fallbacks for derivatives linked to certain IBORs, changes went into effect on January 25, 2021.\nThe replacement of LIBOR creates operational and market risks that will become clearer as replacement choices are developed. Oriental\u2019s LIBOR exposure is mainly concentrated within its commercial loan portfolio. Oriental has identified its LIBOR-based contracts that will be impacted by the cessation of LIBOR and is incorporating fallback language in negotiated contracts and incorporating a non-LIBOR reference rate and/or fallback language in new contracts to prepare for these changes. Furthermore, management has established a LIBOR transition team to lead Oriental in the execution of its project plan. Uncertainty as to the nature of replacement choices potential changes or other reforms may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCREDIT RISK\nWe are exposed to credit risk in connection with our loans to certain government agencies and municipalities of Puerto Rico, and the restructuring of Puerto Rico government\u2019s debt could adversely affect the value of such loans.\nAt December 31, 2020, we have approximately $99.1 million of direct credit exposure to four municipalities and a Puerto Rico public corporation, a $34.9 million decrease from December 31, 2019. Mainly, the credit exposure consists of collateralized loans or obligations that have special additional property tax revenues pledged for their repayment.\nThe Puerto Rico government faces a number of severe economic and fiscal challenges that are expected to require a significant government restructuring, as well as severe austerity measures to close its significant budget deficit.\nIf the government restructuring affects the ability of the municipalities to pay their obligations to us as they become due, or under certain other circumstances, we may be required to adversely classify such loans and increase the provision for loan losses in connection therewith. Such provision may significantly impact our earnings.\nHeightened credit risk could require us to increase our provision for credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nMaking loans is an essential element of our business, and there is a risk that the loans will not be repaid. This default risk is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\uf0b7 the duration of the loan;\n\uf0b7 credit risks of a particular borrower;\n\uf0b7 changes in economic or industry conditions; and\n\uf0b7 in the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nOur customers might not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans might be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. Hence, we may experience significant loan losses, which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we rely on loan quality reviews, past loss experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be enough to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nOur emphasis on the origination of business and retail loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating our allowance for credit losses. As we continue to increase the amount of these loans, additional or increased provisions for credit losses may be necessary and as a result would decrease our earnings.\nWe strive to maintain an appropriate allowance for credit losses to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We periodically determine the amount of the allowance based on consideration of several factors such as default frequency, internal loan grades, expected future cash collections, loss recovery rates and general economic factors, among others. Our methodology for measuring the adequacy of the allowance relies on several key elements, which include a specific allowance for identified problem loans and a general systematic allowance.\nWe believe our allowance for credit losses is currently sufficient given the constant monitoring of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio. However, there is no precise method of predicting loan losses and therefore we always face the risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed the allowance for credit losses and that additional increases in the allowance for credit losses will be required. In addition, the FDIC as well as the OCFI may require us to establish additional reserves. Additions to the allowance for credit losses would result in a decrease of net earnings and capital and could hinder our ability to pay dividends.\nGiven the economic conditions in Puerto Rico, we may continue to experience increased credit costs or need to take greater than anticipated markdowns and make greater than anticipated provisions to increase the allowances for loan losses that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nBank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe are subject to default and other risks in connection with mortgage loan originations.\nFrom the time that we fund the mortgage loans originated to the time that they are sold, we are generally at risk for any mortgage loan defaults. Once we sell the mortgage loans, the risk of loss from mortgage loan defaults and foreclosures passes to the purchaser or insurer of the mortgage loans. However, in the ordinary course of business, we make representations and warranties to the purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans relating to the validity of such loans. If there is a breach of any of these representations or warranties, we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan. We also may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event that there was improper underwriting or fraud or in the event that the loans become delinquent shortly after they are originated. Any such repurchases in the future may negatively impact our liquidity and operating results. Termination of our ability to sell mortgage products to U.S government-sponsored entities would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur in the event of breaches of our representations and warranties and in various other circumstances, including securities fraud claims, and the amount of such losses could exceed the purchase amount of the related loans. Consequently, we may be exposed to credit risk associated with sold loans. In addition, we incur higher liquidity risk with respect to mortgage loans not eligible to be purchased or insured by FNMA, GNMA or FHLMC, due to a lack of secondary market in which to sell these loans. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased $27.9 million of loans from GNMA and FNMA.\nWe have established reserves in our consolidated financial statements for potential losses that are considered to be both probable and reasonably estimable related to the mortgage loans sold by us. The adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred will depend on, among other things, the actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests, the actual success rate of claimants, developments in litigation related to us and the industry, actual recoveries on the collateral, and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). Due to uncertainties relating to these factors, there can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate or that the total amount of losses incurred will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. For additional information related to our allowance for credit losses, see \u201cNote 7-Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nA continuing decline in the real estate market would likely result in an increase in delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures and in a reduction in loan origination activity, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nThe residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoying periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of lower volumes and industry-wide losses. Even though the market for residential mortgage loan originations in Puerto Rico is currently increasing, the level of mortgage loans that we may originate in the future may decline and adversely impact our business. In addition, the residential mortgage loan origination business is impacted by home values. There is a risk that a reduction in housing values could negatively impact our loss levels on the mortgage loan portfolio because the value of the homes underlying the loans is a primary source of repayment in the event of foreclosure.\nThe decline in Puerto Rico\u2019s economy has had an adverse effect in the credit quality of our loan portfolios. Among other things, during the ongoing recession, we have experienced an increase in the level of non-performing assets and loan loss provision, which adversely affected our profitability. Although the delinquency rates and non-performing assets have decreased recently, they may increase if the recession continues or worsens. If there is another decline in economic activity, additional increases in the allowance for credit losses could be necessary with further adverse effects on our profitability.\nAny sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could harm our ability to sell loans, the price received on the sale of such loans, and the value of the mortgage loan portfolio, all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any material decline in real estate values would weaken our collateral loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower default.\nLoans that we acquired in the Scotiabank transaction may be subject to greater than anticipated impairment.\nWe have made fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities in recording the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition. Actual values of these assets and liabilities could differ from our estimates, which could result in us not achieving the anticipated benefits of the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition. In addition, Scotiabank\u2019s loan scoring system was different than ours, and as we continue to evaluate their loan portfolio using our systems, we may have to make additional adjustments.\nGiven the economic conditions in Puerto Rico, we may continue to experience increased credit costs or need to take greater than anticipated markdowns and make greater than anticipated provisions to increase the allowances for credit losses on the loans acquired that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nOPERATIONS AND BUSINESS RISK\nWe may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition.\nOur future growth and profitability depend, in part, on the ability to successfully manage the combined operations. The success of the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition will depend on, among other things, our ability to assess the quality of assets acquired, to realize anticipated cost savings and to integrate the acquired companies in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt our or the acquired business\u2019s existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenue resulting from any loss of customers. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe may experience losses related to fraud and theft.\nOriental has experienced, and may experience in the future, losses incurred due to customer or employee fraud and theft. These losses may be material and negatively affect Oriental\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or prospects. These losses could also lead to significant reputational risks and other effects. The sophistication of external fraud actors continues to increase, and in some cases includes large criminal rings, which increases the resources and infrastructure needed to thwart these attacks. The industry fraud threat continues to evolve, including but not limited to card fraud, check fraud, social engineering and phishing attacks for identity theft and account takeover. Oriental continues to invest in fraud prevention in the forms of people and systems designed to prevent, detect and mitigate the customer and financial impacts.\nWe are subject to security and operational risks related to our use of technology, including the risk of cyber-attack or cyber theft.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks regarding our customers and their accounts. To provide these products and services, we use information systems and infrastructure that we and third-party service providers operate. As a financial institution, we are also subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection laws, regulations and guidance, as well as to our own internal privacy and information security policies and programs.\nSuch incidents may include unauthorized access to our digital systems for purposes of misappropriation of assets, gaining access to sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Although our information technology structure continues to be subject to cyber attacks, we have not, to our knowledge, experience a breach of cyber-security. Such an event could compromise our confidential information, as well as that of our customers and third parties with whom we interact with and may result in negative consequences.\nWhile we have policies and procedures designated to prevent or limit the effects of a possible security breach of our information systems, if unauthorized persons were somehow to get access to confidential information in our possession or to our proprietary information, it could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems that could adversely affect our business. Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services and systems essential to the operation of our business, and any failure, interruption or termination of such services or systems could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business relies on the secure, successful and uninterrupted functioning of our core banking platform, information technology, telecommunications, and loan servicing. We outsource some of our major systems, such as customer data and deposit processing, part of our mortgage loan servicing, internet and mobile banking, and electronic fund transfer systems. The failure or interruption of such systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or any service agreement on which any of these systems or services is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such systems fail or experience interruptions. In addition, replacing third party service providers could also entail significant delay and expense.\nIf sustained or repeated, a failure, denial or termination of such systems or services could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new loans, service existing loans, gather deposits and/or provide customer service. It could also compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-Compliance with the USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines and other sanctions.\nFinancial institutions are generally required under the USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act to develop programs to prevent such financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist financing activities. Financial institutions are generally also required to file suspicious activity reports with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Treasury Department if such activities are detected. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. We have developed a compliance program reasonably designed to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations. Our failure or the inability to comply with these regulations could result in enforcement actions, fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, intervention or sanctions by regulators, costly litigation, or expensive additional internal controls and systems.\nOur risk management policies, procedures and systems may be inadequate to mitigate all risks inherent in our various businesses.\nA comprehensive risk management function is essential to the financial and operational success of our business. The types of risk we monitor and seek to manage include, but are not limited to, operational, technological, organizational, market, fiduciary, legal, compliance, liquidity and credit risks. We have adopted various policies, procedures and systems to monitor and manage these risks. There can be no assurance that those policies, procedures and systems are adequate to identify and mitigate all risks inherent in our various businesses. Our businesses and the markets in which we operate are also continuously evolving. If we fail to fully understand the implications of changes in our business or the financial markets and to adequately or timely enhance the risk framework to address those changes, we could incur losses. In addition, in a difficult or less liquid market environment, our risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for us to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants.\nLIQUIDITY RISK\nOur business could be adversely affected if we cannot maintain access to stable funding sources.\nOur business requires continuous access to various funding sources. We are able to fund our operations through deposits as well as through advances from the FHLB-NY and FRB-NY; however, our business may need to access other wholesale funding sources, such as repurchase agreements and brokered deposits, which consisted of approximately 1% of our total interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2020.\nBrokered deposits are typically sold through an intermediary to small retail investors. Our ability to continue to attract brokered deposits is subject to variability based upon a number of factors, including volume and volatility in the global securities markets, our credit rating and the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities. Brokered deposits are generally considered a less stable source of funding than core deposits obtained through retail bank branches. Investors in brokered deposits are generally more sensitive to interest rates and will generally move funds from one depository institution to another based on small differences in interest rates offered on deposits.\nWe expect to have continued access to credit from the foregoing sources of funds. However, there can be no assurance that such financing sources will continue to be available or will be available on favorable terms. In a period of financial disruption, or if negative developments occur with respect to us, the availability and cost of funding sources could be adversely affected. In that event, our cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing the net interest income, or we may need to dispose of a portion of the investment portfolio, which, depending upon market conditions, could result in realizing a loss or experiencing other adverse accounting consequences upon such dispositions. The interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by, among other things, applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful to deal with dramatic or unanticipated changes in the global securities markets or other reductions in liquidity driven by us or market-related events. In the event that such sources of funds are reduced or eliminated, and we are not able to replace them on a cost-effective basis, we may be forced to curtail or cease our loan origination business and treasury activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries. Dividends to us from our subsidiaries have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock, make payments on corporate debt securities and meet other obligations. There are various U.S. federal and Puerto Rico law limitations on the extent to which Oriental Bank, our main subsidiary, can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans. These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements, U.S. federal and Puerto Rico banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Board governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. Further, under the Basel III capital rules adopted by the federal banking regulatory agencies, a banking organization will need to hold a capital conservation buffer (composed of common equity tier 1 capital) greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Compliance with the capital conservation buffer is determined as of the end of the calendar quarter prior to any such capital distribution or discretionary bonus payment.\nIf our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments while maintaining adequate capital levels, our liquidity may be affected, and we may not be able to make dividend payments to our holders of common and preferred stock or payments on outstanding corporate debt securities or meet other obligations, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or perception of financial health.\nIn addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\nCOMPETITIVE AND STRATEGIC RISK\nCompetition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits and assets to manage. The competition in originating loans and attracting assets comes principally from other Puerto Rico, U.S., and foreign banks, investment advisors, securities broker-dealers, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance companies, and other institutional lenders and purchasers of loans. We will encounter greater competition as we expand our operations. Increased competition may require us to increase the rates paid on deposits or lower the rates charged on loans which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and local laws and regulations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on all or part of our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act has a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes, as discussed under the subheading \u201cDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\u201d in Item 1of this annual report. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe may be required to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors.\nReputational risk and social factors may impact our results.\nOur ability to originate loans and to attract deposits and assets is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer, commercial and funding markets of our business practices and our financial health. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including lending practices, regulatory compliance, inadequate protection of customer information, or sales and marketing, and from actions taken by regulators in response to such conduct. Adverse perceptions regarding us could lead to difficulties in originating loans and generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them.\nIn addition, a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity, including credit card use, payment patterns and the rate of defaults by account holders and borrowers. If consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt, or if consumption trends decline, our business and financial results will be negatively affected.\nACCOUNTING AND TAX RISK\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by FASB. Market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to promulgate new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments, structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. See \u201cNote 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of any accounting developments that have been issued but not yet implemented. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, the effects on our consolidated financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that applies to the consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets could be determined to be impaired in the future and could decrease Oriental\u2019s earnings.\nWe are required to test our goodwill, core deposit intangible, customer relationship intangible and other intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common shares, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities, and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our common shares or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly restrict Oriental\u2019s ability to make dividend payments without prior regulatory approval.\nBased on our annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that no impairment charges were necessary. As of December 31, 2020, we had on our consolidated balance sheet $86.1 million of goodwill in connection with the BBVAPR Acquisition and the FDIC-assisted Eurobank acquisition, $35.0 million of core deposit intangible in connection with the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition and the FDIC-assisted Eurobank acquisition and the BBVAPR Acquisition, a $10.6 million of customer relationship intangible in connection with the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition and the BBVAPR Acquisition, and a $0.3 million of other intangibles in connection with the Scotiabank PR & USVI Acquisition. There can be no assurance that future evaluations of such goodwill or intangibles will not result in any impairment charges. Among other factors, further declines in our common stock as a result of macroeconomic conditions and the general weakness of the Puerto Rico economy, could lead to an impairment of such assets. If such assets become impaired, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nLegislative and other measures that may be taken by Puerto Rico governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nLegislative changes, particularly changes in local tax laws, could adversely impact our results of operations. In an effort to address the Commonwealth\u2019s ongoing fiscal problems, the Puerto Rico government has enacted tax reforms in the past providing, among other things, for changes in income tax rates and the expansion of certain taxes, such as the sales and use tax, and may do so again in the future.\nWe operate two IBE units and an IBE subsidiary pursuant to the IBE Act which provides significant tax advantages. The IBEs have an exemption from Puerto Rico income taxes on interest earned on, or gain realized from the sale of, non-Puerto Rico assets, including U.S. government obligations and certain mortgage-backed securities. This exemption has allowed us to have an effective tax rate below the maximum statutory tax rate. In the past, the Legislature of Puerto Rico has considered proposals to curb the tax benefits afforded to IBEs. For example, Puerto Rico enacted legislation in 2012 under which no new IBEs may be organized and newly organized \u201cinternational financial entities\u201d are generally subject to a 4% Puerto Rico income tax rate. In the event other legislation is enacted by the Puerto Rico government to eliminate or modify the tax exemption provided to IBEs, the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results, including an increase in income tax expense and consequently our effective tax rate, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 11208, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "OFG"}
