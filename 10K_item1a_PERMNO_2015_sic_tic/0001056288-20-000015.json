{"cik": "1056288", "company": "FEDERATED HERMES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nAs an investment manager, risk is an inherent part of Federated's business. U.S., UK and other global financial markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. If any of the following risks actually occur, Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only risks involved in Federated's business. Additional risks not presently known to Federated or that Federated currently considers to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of a Material Concentration in Revenue. At any point in time, a meaningful or significant portion of Federated's total AUM or revenue may be attributable to one or more products or strategies, or asset classes, offered by Federated, or one or more clients or customer intermediaries with whom Federated has a relationship. See Note (5) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on material concentrations in Federated's revenue. A significant and prolonged decline in the AUM of a strategy, asset class or fund with a material concentration could have a material adverse effect on Federated's future revenues and, to a lesser extent, net income, due to a related reduction in distribution expenses associated with these funds. Likewise, significant negative changes in Federated's relationship with a customer with a material concentration could have a material adverse effect on Federated's future revenues and, to a lesser extent, net income due to a related reduction in distribution expenses associated with this customer. A significant change in Federated's investment management business or a significant reduction in AUM due to regulatory changes or developments, changes in the financial markets, such as significant and rapid increases in interest rates over a short period of time causing certain investors to prefer direct investments in interest-bearing securities, non-competitive performance, the availability, supply and/or market interest in repurchase agreements and other investments, significant deterioration in investor confidence, a return to declining or prolonged periods of low short-term interest rates or negative yields and resulting fee waivers, investor preferences for deposit products or other Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured products, or exchange-traded funds, index funds or other passive investment products, changes in product fee structures, changes in relationships with financial intermediaries, or other circumstances, could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Low Short-Term Interest Rates. After raising the federal funds target rate by 0.25% four times during 2018 (the ninth such increase since December 2015), the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board (FOMC) decreased the federal funds target rate by 0.25% three times during 2019 to its current target of 1.50-1.75%. The federal funds target rate, which drives short-term interest rates, had been close to zero for nearly seven years prior to the December 2015 increase. The long-term low interest-rate environment resulted in the gross yield earned by certain money market funds not being sufficient to cover all of the fund's operating expenses. As a result, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, Federated implemented voluntary waivers (either through fee waivers or reimbursements or assumptions of expenses) in order for certain money market funds to maintain positive or zero net yields (Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers). These waivers were partially offset by related reductions in distribution expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of Federated's mutual understanding and agreement with third-party intermediaries to share the impact of the Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers.\nDuring periods of a low interest-rate environment, Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers are calculated as a percentage of AUM in certain money market funds and thus can vary depending upon the asset levels and mix in such funds. While increases in short-term interest rates generally have the effect of decreasing, and have decreased, these fee waivers for certain money market funds, the corresponding increases in yields and the resulting decrease in fee waivers are neither certain nor directly proportional. In addition, the level of waivers are dependent on several other factors including, but not limited to, yields on instruments available for purchase by, and changes in expenses of, the money market funds. In any given period, a combination of these factors impacts the amount of Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. As an isolated variable, an increase in yields on instruments held by the money market funds would cause the pre-tax impact of fee waivers to decrease. Conversely, as an isolated variable, an increase in expenses of the money market funds would cause the pre-tax impact of fee waivers to increase.\nWith regard to asset mix, changes in the relative amount of money market fund assets in prime and government money market funds (or between such funds and other money market funds or other products) as well as the mix among certain share classes that vary in pricing structure can impact the level of fee waivers. Generally, prime money market funds will waive less than government money market funds as a result of higher gross yields on the underlying investments. As such, as an isolated variable, an increase in the relative proportion of average managed assets invested in prime money market funds as compared to total average money market fund assets should typically result in lower Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. The opposite would also be true.\nThe FOMC increased the federal funds target rate range by 0.25% on nine occasions between December 2015 and December 2018. The interest rate increase in December 2017 eliminated the need to continue the Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers. The\nFOMC decreased the federal funds target rate range by 0.25% in August, September and October 2019. Despite the FOMC reducing interest rates three times in 2019, there were no Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers in 2019. See Potential Adverse Effects of Increased Competition in the Investment Management Business in this section for information on competitive waivers currently being implemented by Federated, other than the Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers discussed above.\nThere is no guarantee that the FOMC will continue to maintain the federal funds rate at its current level. Federated is unable to predict when, or to what extent, the FOMC will maintain or further decrease or increase their target for the federal funds rate. Assuming asset levels and mix remain constant and based on recent market conditions, management estimates that Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers will remain at or near zero.\nThe actual amount of future fee waivers, if any, the resulting negative impact of any waivers and Federated's ability to recover the net pre-tax impact of such waivers (that is, the ability to capture the pre-tax impact going forward, not re-capture previously waived amounts) could vary significantly from prior years as they are contingent on a number of variables including, but not limited to, changes in asset levels and mix within the money market funds or among customer assets, yields on instruments available for purchase by the money market funds, actions by the Governors, the FOMC, the Treasury Department, the SEC, the DOL, the FSOC and other governmental entities, changes in fees and expenses of the money market funds, changes in customer relationships, changes in money market product structures and offerings, demand for competing products, changes in distribution models, changes in the distribution fee arrangements with third parties, Federated's willingness to continue the fee waivers and changes in the extent to which the impact of the waivers is shared by any one or more third parties. The duration, level and impact of a further decline in interest rates and/or future Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers, if any, as well as Federated's ability to recover the net pre-tax impact of such waivers (that is, the ability to capture the pre-tax income going forward, not re-capture previously waived amounts) could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Rising Interest Rates. Increases in interest rates could also have an adverse effect on Federated's revenue from money market, fixed-income, alternative/private markets and other products and strategies. The value of equity securities (such as dividend paying equity securities) also may rise and fall in response to changes in interest rates. In a rising short-term interest rate environment, certain investors using money market products and strategies or other short-duration fixed-income products and strategies for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other products or strategies holding lower-yielding instruments. In addition, rising interest rates will tend to reduce the fair value of securities held in various investment products and strategies. Rising interest rates also may impact demand for and cost to finance real estate and impact the value of real estate or returns on real estate and other alternative products and strategies. Among other potential adverse effects, rising interest rates may result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility in financial markets and could negatively impact the performance of Federated's products and strategies and Federated's revenue. Management cannot estimate the impact of rising interest rates (including, for example on Federated's revenue), but such impact could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of a Decline or Disruption in the Economy or Financial Markets. Economic or financial market (including securities, real estate, credit and other markets) downturns, disruptions or other conditions (domestic or international) may cause volatility, illiquidity and other potential adverse effects in the financial markets and adversely affect, potentially in a material way, the supply of investments, such as money market or municipal (tax-exempt) securities and the profitability and performance of, demand for and investor confidence in Federated's investment products, strategies and services. Such economic or financial market downturns, disruptions or other conditions may include, for example, disruptions in the securities, real estate and credit markets, defaults or poor performance in certain sectors of the economy, unemployment, excessive corporate debt levels, the commencement, continuation or ending of government policies and reforms (including those of new administrations or otherwise), stimulus programs, and other market-related actions, quantitative easing or tightening or other changes in monetary policy, central bank activism through continued ownership, exchange, cancellation or issuance of debt or other means, increased regulation or a slower pace for new regulation or deregulation, increases or decreases in interest rates, changes in oil prices or other changes in commodity markets or prices, changes in currency values, changes in property values and financial costs, or exchange rates or currency abandonment, inflation or deflation, index changes, widening bid/ask spreads, changes in the allocation of capital to market-making, restructuring of government-sponsored entities, imposition of economic sanctions, trade friction or trade wars and increased trade tariffs, economic or political weakness, geopolitical tensions or military escalation or other instability in certain countries or regions, technology-related or cyber-attacks or incidents, terrorism, the prospects for or concerns about any of the foregoing factors or events, or other factors or events that affect the financial markets. For example, regarding currency abandonment and political instability, there remains uncertainty regarding the final arrangements that will apply to the UK's relationship with the EU and other countries post-Brexit. This uncertainty may affect other countries in the EU and elsewhere. The UK's departure from the EU also may cause volatility within the EU, triggering prolonged economic downturns in certain European countries or sparking additional\nMember States to depart, or contemplate departing, from the EU. In addition, Brexit creates the possibility of additional economic stresses for the UK, including potential decreased trade, difficulty in, or increased expenses relating to, marketing and selling UK funds and other financial products in the EU and EU funds and other financial products in the UK, capital outflows, devaluation of the British pound sterling, wider corporate bond spreads due to uncertainty, worker dislocation or restrictions, and declines in business and consumer spending as well as foreign direct investment. See Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters for additional information on Brexit. Each of the above factors, among others, may cause or contribute to economic or financial market downturns, disruptions or other conditions and their potentially adverse effects. In addition, Federated's products and strategies may be adversely affected, potentially in a material way, by changes in U.S., UK, EU or other markets, downgrades of U.S., UK or other countries' credit ratings, the U.S. debt ceiling or other developments in the U.S., UK and other countries as well as by actual or potential deterioration in international sovereign, commodity or currency market conditions.\nAt December 31, 2019, Federated's liquid assets of $359.1 million included investments in certain money market and fluctuating-value Federated Funds that may have direct and/or indirect exposures to international sovereign debt and currency risks. Federated and the money market and other fluctuating NAV funds managed or distributed by Federated also interact with various other financial industry participants, such as counterparties, broker/dealers, banks, clearing organizations, other investment products and customers, as a result of operations, trading, distribution and other relationships. As a result, Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows could be adversely affected by the creditworthiness or financial soundness of other financial industry participants, particularly in times of economic or financial stress or disruption. There can be no assurance that potential losses that may be realized as a result of these exposures will not have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe ability of Federated to compete and sustain asset and revenue growth is dependent, in part, on the relative attractiveness of the types of investment products and strategies Federated offers and its investment performance under prevailing market conditions. Adverse market conditions or other events also could impact Federated's customers. In the event of extreme circumstances, such as economic, political, or business crises, Federated's products and strategies may suffer significant net redemptions in AUM causing severe liquidity issues in its short-term, fixed-income or certain other sponsored investment products and strategies and declines in the value of and returns on AUM, all of which could cause material adverse effects on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nCustody, depository and portfolio accounting services for the Federated Funds generally are outsourced to third-party financial institutions that are leading providers of such fund services. Accounting records for the Federated Funds are maintained by these service providers (or vendors). These service providers, or other service providers of Federated and its products or customers, could also be adversely affected by the adverse market conditions described above. It is not possible to predict the extent to which the services or products Federated receives from such service providers would be interrupted or affected by such situations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a potential service interruption or Federated's ability to find a suitable replacement would not have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Changes in Laws, Regulations and Other Rules on Federated's Investment Management Business. Federated and its investment management business are (and any new business line commenced or acquired by Federated would be) subject to extensive regulation both in and outside the U.S. Federated and its products, such as the Federated Funds, and strategies are subject to: federal securities laws, principally the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act; state laws regarding securities fraud and registration; and regulations or other rules, promulgated by various regulatory authorities, self-regulatory organizations or exchanges, both domestically and abroad, including, but not limited to, the SEC, FINRA, FCA, CBI and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). From time to time, the federal securities laws have been or may be augmented or amended substantially. For example, among other measures, Federated and its products and strategies have been impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Patriot Act of 2001 and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.\nFederated and its domestic products (such as the Federated Funds) and strategies, and any non-U.S. products (such as non-U.S. Federated Funds) and strategies to the extent offered in the U.S., continue to be primarily regulated by the SEC. Federated, and certain Federated Funds, are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA) due to their investment in futures, swaps or certain other commodity interests in more than de minimis amounts. In addition, during the past several years, regulators, self-regulatory organizations or exchanges such as the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, NFA, NYSE and state or local governments and regulators, have adopted, and may continue to adopt, other regulations, rules and amendments that have increased Federated's operating expenses and affected the conduct of its business, as well as Federated's AUM, revenues and operating income, and may continue to do so. Federated's business is affected by laws, regulations, and regulatory authorities that impact the manner in which Federated's products are structured,\ndistributed, provided or sold. Federated and its products and strategies also are affected by certain other laws and regulations governing banks and other financial institutions or intermediaries. While the pace of regulation has slowed in 2018 and 2019, the results of the 2020 presidential election may result in increased regulation, which could further increase the cost of compliance for Federated.\nFederated's and its products' operations outside of the U.S. are subject to foreign laws and regulation, which are promulgated or amended from time to time, by foreign regulatory or other authorities, such as the FCA for London-based operations, the CBI for Dublin-based operations, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority for Frankfurt-based operations, the Cayman Island Monetary Authority for Cayman Island products, and the Ontario (and certain other provincial) Securities Commission for Canadian products. For example, Federated's stewardship services may be impacted by proxy advisor regulations, including the Proxy Advisors (Shareholders' Rights) Regulations 2019 passed by the UK Parliament. (See Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters for additional information on laws and regulations applicable to Federated's business.) In addition to existing and potential future regulation, a FTT, particularly if enacted with broad application in the UK or EU, or even the U.S. (as proposed by certain Democratic candidates for the 2020 Presidential election), would be detrimental to Federated's business. Regulatory reforms stemming from Brexit, as well as the potential political and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit or other initiatives also may increase volatility in the UK and EU and could be detrimental to Federated's business. Additionally, Federated's acquisition of Hermes increases the potential impact that Brexit, and resulting changes, may have on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provided for a systemic risk regulation regime under which it is possible that Federated, and/or any one or more of its products (such as the Federated Funds), could be subject to designation as a systemically important financial institution by the FSOC. Similarly, it is possible that the FSB could designate Federated, and/or one of its products (such as the non-U.S. Federated Funds), as a non-bank, non-insurance company global systemically important financial institution. Among other potential impacts, any such designation would result in Federated and/or its products being subject to additional banking regulation and bank-oriented measures, including, for example, capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limitations, enhanced public disclosures and risk management requirements, as well as oversight by the Governors or FSB, in addition to being subject to primary regulation by securities regulators such as the SEC, FCA and CBI.\nAs Federated's business grows (whether organically or through acquisition or whether through new products, strategies or services being offered or through growth of existing products, strategies and services, or otherwise), Federated's products, strategies and operations need to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, interpretations and government policies, which increases compliance risk and operating expenses, including the costs associated with compliance. Compliance risk and operating expenses also can increase when Federated expands its use of ESG, sustainability, stewardship or other data inputs or investment techniques in providing its investment products, strategies and services, enters new countries or markets, and/or financial products and other investments, as well as when markets and technology increase in complexity.\nRegulators, such as the SEC, FCA and CBI, also have undertaken or may undertake examination, investigations, and/or enforcement actions involving investment management industry participants, such as Federated and its products. Federated expends internal and external resources to respond to examinations and investigations, and defend enforcement actions, which increases operating expenses, including professional fees and costs associated with compliance.\nManagement continues to monitor and evaluate the impact of the Regulatory Developments discussed above (and in Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters) on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. These Regulatory Developments include, among others, stress testing requirements, fund of funds rules, Regulation Best Interest, a new SEC derivatives rule, Brexit-related regulation, a potential FTT, new EU regulatory requirements, liquidity rules, and EU money market fund regulation. Among other potential impacts, these Regulatory Developments have increased, and may continue to increase, in addition to compliance risks and compliance costs, the costs associated with technology, legal, operations and other efforts to address regulatory-related matters. These regulatory requirements and developments also have caused, and may continue to cause, certain product line-up, structure, pricing and product development changes, changes in the ability to utilize \"soft dollars\" to pay for certain research and brokerage services (rather than Federated paying for such services directly), money market, equity, fixed-income, alternative/private markets and multi-asset products to be less attractive to institutional and other investors, reductions in the number of Federated Funds offered by intermediaries, changes in the fees Federated, retirement plan advisors and intermediaries will be able to earn on investment products and services sold to retirement plan clients, and reductions in AUM, revenues and operating profits, as well as changes in asset flows, levels and mix and customer relationships. As examples, it became necessary for Hermes to establish offices in Ireland, Germany and Denmark, as Brexit may result in it becoming more difficult to passport products between the UK and EU Member States. In addition, certain money market funds or other products or strategies may become less attractive to institutional or other investors, which could result in changes in asset mix and reductions in AUM, revenues and operating income.\nOn a cumulative basis, Federated's regulatory, product development and restructuring, and other efforts in response to the Regulatory Developments discussed above, including the internal and external resources dedicated to such efforts, have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Federated's expenses and, in turn, financial performance. The floating NAV for institutional and municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds, and redemption fees and liquidity gates, required by the 2014 Money Fund Rules and Guidance, effective October 14, 2016, resulted in a shift in asset mix from institutional prime and municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds to stable NAV government money market funds across the investment management industry and at Federated, which impacted its AUM, revenues and operating income. While 2018 and 2019 saw a shift in asset mix back toward institutional prime and municipal (tax-exempt) money market funds, there is no guarantee such shift will continue and return asset mix between institutional prime, municipal (or tax-exempt) and government money market funds to pre-October 2016 levels. The regulatory changes and developments in the current regulatory environment, and Federated's efforts in responding to them, could have a material and adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. While the FSOC's change in focus and continuing transparency efforts have reduced the possibility of any Federated products being designated a systemically important non-bank financial company, management also believes that the designation of Federated and/or one or more products as a systemically important financial institution or a non-bank, non-insurance company global systemically important financial institution by the FSB, and/or the issuance of final regulations or reforms relating to such designations, would be detrimental to Federated's money market fund business and could materially and adversely affect Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Given the current regulatory environment and the potential for a slower pace for new regulation or future additional or modified regulation or guidance, Federated is unable to fully assess the degree of the impact of adopted or proposed regulations and other Regulatory Developments, and Federated's efforts related thereto, on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nChanges in laws, regulations, rules, interpretations or governmental policies, domestically and abroad, also impact the financial intermediaries, service providers (or vendors), customers and other third-parties with whom Federated, and its products (such as the Federated Funds), conduct business. For example, the DOL is expected to issue a new fiduciary rule in early 2020. Additionally, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act or Regulation Best Interest, may affect intermediaries' sale or use of Federated's products or strategies. Among other potential impacts, these changes are affecting, and may continue to affect, Federated's arrangements with these intermediaries, and may continue to increase fee pressure, reduce the number of Federated products and strategies offered by intermediaries, cause certain clients or intermediaries to favor passive products over actively managed products, increase respective operating expenses and distribution costs, result in lower AUM, change asset flows, levels and mix, and otherwise affect the conduct of Federated's or such intermediaries' respective businesses. This resulted, and will likely continue to result, in Federated or one or more of these third parties seeking to restructure or alter their compensation or other terms of the business arrangements between Federated or its products (including the Federated Funds) and one or more of these third parties. The above factors could have a material adverse impact on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nFor a further discussion of U.S. and international Regulatory Developments that can impact Federated and its business, products, strategies and services, see Item 1 - Business under the caption Regulatory Matters.\nFinally, Federated's business also has been, and will continue to be, impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act), signed into law on December 22, 2017. See Note (16) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, various service industries, including, for example, mutual fund service providers, have been, and continue to be, the subject of changes in tax policy that impact their state and local tax liability. Changes that have been adopted or proposed include (1) an expansion of the nature of a service company's activities that subject it to tax in a jurisdiction, (2) a change in the methodology by which multi-state companies apportion their income between jurisdictions, and (3) a requirement that affiliated companies calculate their state tax as one combined entity. As adopted changes become effective and additional jurisdictions enact similar changes, among other potential impacts, there could be a material adverse effect on Federated's tax liability and effective tax rate and, as a result, net income. Various investment products also may be impacted by tax changes, which could have an adverse effect on the products and Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effect of Providing Financial Support to Investment Products. Federated may, from time to time, elect to provide financial support to its sponsored investment products (such as the Federated Funds). Providing such support utilizes capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses resulting from such support, or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products, could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRisk of Federated's Money Market Products' Ability to Maintain a Stable Net Asset Value. Approximately 40% of Federated's total revenue for 2019 was attributable to money market assets. An investment in money market funds is neither insured nor guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Federated's retail and government/public debt money market funds, as well as its private and collective money market funds, seek to maintain a stable or constant NAV. Federated\nalso offers non-U.S. low volatility money market funds that seek to maintain a constant NAV, but will move to a four-digit NAV if such fund's net asset value falls outside of a twenty basis point collar. Although stable or constant NAV money market funds seek to maintain an NAV of $1.00 per share, it is possible for an investor to lose money by investing in these funds. Federated also offers institutional prime or municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds which transact at a fluctuating NAV that uses four-decimal-place precision ($1.0000). Federated also offers a short-term variable NAV non-U.S. money market fund. It is possible for an investor to lose money by investing in these funds. Federated devotes substantial resources, such as significant credit analysis and attention to security valuation in connection with the management of its products and strategies. However, the NAV of an institutional prime or municipal (or tax-exempt) money market fund, or variable NAV fund or, if the above described conditions are met, a low-volatility NAV fund, can fluctuate, and there is no guarantee that a government/public debt or retail (i.e. stable or constant NAV) money market fund, or a low-volatility money market fund, will be able to preserve a stable or constant NAV in the future. Market conditions could lead to a limited supply of money market securities and severe liquidity issues and/or declines in interest rates or additional prolonged periods of low yields in money market products or strategies, and regulatory changes or developments could lead to shifts in asset levels and mix, which could impact money market fund NAVs and performance. If the NAV of a Federated stable or constant NAV money market fund were to decline to less than $1.00 per share, such Federated money market fund would likely experience significant redemptions, resulting in reductions in AUM, loss of shareholder confidence and reputational harm, all of which could cause material adverse effects on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. It is also possible that, if the fluctuating NAV of an institutional prime or municipal (or tax-exempt) money market fund, or variable NAV money market fund or low-volatility money market fund consistently or significantly declines to less than $1.0000 per share, such Federated money market fund could experience significant redemptions, resulting in reductions in AUM, loss of shareholder confidence and reputational harm, all of which could cause material adverse effects on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nNo Assurance of Access to Sufficient Liquidity. From time to time, Federated's operations may require more cash than is available from operations. In these circumstances, it may be necessary to borrow from lending facilities or to raise capital by securing new debt or by selling shares of Federated equity or debt securities. Federated's ability to raise additional capital in the future will be affected by several factors including, for example, Federated's creditworthiness and the market value of Federated's common stock, as well as general market conditions. There can be no assurance that Federated will be able to obtain these funds and financing on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if Federated cannot obtain such funds, it could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. If a Federated Fund requires liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions or for other reasons, there also can be no assurance that such Federated Fund will be able to access any available line of credit, rely on inter-fund lending arrangements or access other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms, if any at all, and, if such a Federated Fund cannot obtain sufficient liquidity, it could have a material adverse effect on such Federated Fund, result in redemptions and a corresponding reduction in Federated's AUM and Federated's revenue, and Federated may decide to provide credit support to such Federated Fund. These factors could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRecruiting and Retaining Key Personnel. Federated's ability to attract or acquire, and motivate and retain, quality personnel has contributed significantly to its growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining customers. The market for qualified executives, portfolio managers, analysts, traders, sales representatives and other key personnel is extremely competitive. There can be no assurance that Federated will be successful in its efforts to recruit or acquire, and motivate and retain, the required personnel. In addition to competing opportunities, personnel elect to pursue other interests for business, personal and other reasons or retire from time to time. Federated has encouraged the continued retention of its executives and other key personnel through measures such as providing competitive compensation arrangements and, in certain cases, employment agreements. The loss of any such personnel could have an adverse effect on Federated. In certain circumstances, the departure of key employees could cause higher redemption rates for certain AUM or the loss of customer accounts or relationships. Moreover, since certain of Federated's products and strategies, or customer relationships, contribute significantly to its revenues and earnings, the loss of even a small number of key personnel associated with these products or strategies, or customer relationships, could have a disproportionate adverse impact, potentially in a material way, on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Increased Competition in the Investment Management Business. The investment management business is highly competitive. Federated competes in the management and distribution of investment products and strategies (such as mutual funds and Separate Accounts) and stewardship services with other fund management companies and investment advisors, national and regional broker/dealers, commercial banks, insurance companies and other institutions. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and brand recognition than Federated. Competition is based on various factors, including, among others, business reputation, investment performance, quality of service, the strength and continuity of management and selling relationships, distribution services offered, technological innovation (e.g., the use of financial technology or artificial intelligence in providing investment advice), the type (e.g., passive versus actively managed, fund\nversus FDIC-insured deposits) and range of products and strategies offered and fees charged. As with any highly competitive market, competitive pricing structures are important. If competitors charge lower fees for similar products or strategies, Federated has reduced, or may decide to further reduce, the fees on its own products or strategies (either directly on a gross basis or on a net basis through fee waivers) for competitive purposes in order to retain or attract customers. Increased competition also may require changes in Federated's business model, products (e.g., launching ETFs) or strategies to respond to competition from existing and new market innovations and competitors, which can increase expenses and creates the risk that such changes will not be successful or Federated will not achieve its long-term strategic objectives. Such fee reductions, changes in business models or strategies, or other effects of competition, could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nMany of Federated's products and strategies are designed for use by institutions such as banks, insurance companies and other corporations. A large portion of Federated's managed assets, particularly money market, fixed-income and alternative/private markets assets, are held by institutional investors. If or when the structure of institutional investment products, such as money market funds, changes or becomes disfavored by institutions, whether due to regulatory or market changes, competing products (such as insured deposit products or non-transparent actively managed ETFs) or otherwise, Federated may be unable to retain or grow its share of this market and this could adversely affect Federated's future profitability and have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Certain of Federated's products and strategies also may be impact oriented and may not be suitable investments for certain fiduciary customers without obtaining appropriate consent. This may limit Federated's ability to market or grow assets in such products and this could adversely affect Federated's future profitability and affect, potentially in a material way, Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nA significant portion of Federated's revenue is derived from providing products (such as mutual funds) and strategies to the U.S. Financial Intermediary market, comprising over 7,700 national, regional and independent broker/dealers, banks and registered investment advisors. The future profitability of Federated will be adversely affected if it is unable to retain or grow its share of this market, and could also be adversely affected by consolidations in the banking and securities industries, as well as regulatory changes or developments impacting its customers.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Changes in Federated's Distribution Channels. Federated acts as a wholesaler of investment products and strategies to financial intermediaries, including, for example, banks, broker/dealers, registered investment advisors and other financial planners. Federated also sells investment products and strategies, and stewardship services, directly to corporations, institutions and other customers. There can be no assurance that any product diversification efforts (whether to Federated's fund line-up or geographically), ESG positioning or investments in data and analytics to bolster Federated's distribution efforts will be successful. There also can be no assurance that Federated will continue to have access to any financial intermediary or financial intermediaries that currently distribute Federated products and strategies, that Federated's relationship with any one or more financial intermediaries or other customers will continue over time or on existing economic terms, or that Federated's sales or distribution efforts will achieve any particular level of success. The impact of Voluntary Yield-related Fee Waivers, other waivers for competitive purposes, and related reductions in distribution expense can vary depending upon, among other variables, changes in distribution models, changes in the distribution fee arrangements with one or more financial intermediaries, changes in customer relationships and changes in the extent to which the impact of the waivers is shared by one or more financial intermediaries. In addition, exclusive of the impacts of waivers and related reductions in distribution expense, Federated has experienced increases in the cost of distribution as a percentage of total fund revenue from 25% in 2018 to 26% in 2019. Federated expects such costs to continue to increase in total due to asset growth, and per dollar of revenue earned due to the competitive pressures of the investment management business. Higher distribution costs reduce Federated's operating and net income.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Declines in the Amount of or Changes in the Mix of Assets under Management. A significant portion of Federated's revenue is derived from investment advisory fees, which are typically based on the value of managed assets and vary with the type of asset being managed, with higher fees generally earned on equity and multi-asset products and strategies than on fixed-income, alternative/private markets and money market products and strategies. Federated also may earn performance fees or carried interest on certain products and types of assets. Mutual fund and other fund products generally have a higher management-fee rate than Separate Accounts. Additionally, certain components of distribution expense can vary depending upon the asset class, distribution channel and/or the size or structure of the customer relationship. Consequently, significant fluctuations in the value of securities held by, or the level of redemptions from, the products (such as the Federated Funds) or strategies advised by Federated, and overall asset mix among products and strategies, may materially affect the amount of managed assets and thus Federated's revenue, profitability and growth. Similarly, changes in Federated's average asset mix across both asset and product or strategy types have a direct impact on Federated's revenue and profitability. Federated generally pays out a larger portion of the revenue earned from managed assets in money market and multi-asset funds than the revenue earned from managed assets in equity, fixed-income and alternative/private markets funds. A significant\nportion of Federated's managed assets is in investment products or strategies that permit investors to redeem or withdraw their investment at any time. Capacity constraints, where the size of AUM in a particular product, strategy or asset class make it more difficult to trade efficiently in the market, can result in certain products, strategies, or asset classes being closed to new investment, which may result in redemptions or a reallocation of assets to other products, strategies or asset classes. Additionally, changing market conditions may cause a shift in Federated's asset mix towards money market and fixed-income products or strategies, and regulatory changes or developments may cause a shift between money fund products or from money market funds to other products. Each of the above factors may cause a decline in or otherwise affect, potentially in a material way, Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Poor Investment Performance. Success in the investment management business is largely dependent on investment performance relative to market conditions and the performance of competing products and strategies. Good performance generally assists retention and growth of managed assets, resulting in additional revenues. Good performance can also result in performance fees or carried interest being earned on certain products. Conversely, poor performance, or the failure to meet product or strategy investment objectives and policies, tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions, and failure to earn performance fees, carried interest and/or other fees. A product or strategy being, or becoming, an unsuitable product or strategy for a customer, whether due to changes in customer investment objectives or otherwise, also tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions, and failure to earn performance fees, carried interest and/or other fees. For certain products or strategies, failure to integrate and apply acceptable environmental, societal, or governance standards, sustainability or responsible investment may be considered, or result in, poor performance, and result in decreased sales and increased redemptions, and failure to earn performance fees, carried interest and/or other fees. The failure to earn performance fees, carried interest and/or other fees results in a corresponding decrease in revenues and non-operating income to Federated. Poor performance could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Market conditions, such as volatility, illiquidity and rising interest rates, among other conditions, can adversely affect the performance of certain quantitative or other investment strategies or certain products, asset classes or sectors. The effects of poor performance on Federated could be magnified where assets or customers are concentrated in certain strategies, products, asset classes or sectors. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and poor performance of investments made by Federated, or derivatives (including, for example, hedges or forward contracts) or other financial transactions entered into by Federated, can result in investment or capital losses and also can materially adversely affect Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nOperational Risks. Federated's products, business and operations are supported internally and through management of relationships, including, for example, outsourcing relationships with various third party service providers (or vendors), both domestically and internationally. In turn, service providers' operations rely on additional relationships with other third parties. Operational risks include, but are not limited to, improper, inefficient, or unauthorized execution, processing, pricing and/or monitoring of transactions, inadequate, inefficient, inflexible, deficient or non-scalable technology, operating systems or other infrastructure, poor performance by internal resources or third party service providers, failure to appropriately supervise internal resources or third party service providers, business disruptions, inadequacies or breaches in Federated's, its products' or a service provider's internal control processes, unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of, or access to, confidential, proprietary or non-public personal information and noncompliance with regulatory requirements, investment mandates and related investment parameters, or customer-imposed restrictions. As Federated's and its relevant service providers' businesses expand and require additional scalability, operational risk increases. There is a risk that changes in operational systems and business processes are not completed correctly, in a controlled manner, in a timely manner or in a manner that achieves intended results. Management relies on its employees, systems and business continuity plans, and those of relevant service providers, to comply with established procedures, controls, regulatory requirements, investment parameters or customer-imposed restrictions. Breakdown or improper use of systems, human error or improper action by employees or service providers, or noncompliance with regulations or other rules, investment parameters or customer-imposed restrictions, could cause material adverse effects on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nNo Assurance of Successful Acquisitions. Federated's business strategy contemplates seeking acquisition candidates, including acquisitions of other investment management companies and investment assets, both domestically and internationally. There can be no assurance that Federated will find suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and with an aligned business culture and vision, have sufficient capital resources to realize its acquisition strategy, be successful in entering into definitive agreements for or consummating desired acquisitions, or successfully collaborating with acquired companies or integrating acquired companies or assets into Federated, or its products or strategies. There also can be no assurance that any such acquisitions, if consummated, will not increase organizational stress to unacceptable levels or cause process failures, or that any such acquisition, if consummated, will increase value or otherwise prove to be advantageous to Federated. On the other hand, successful collaboration with acquired companies or integration of acquired companies or assets may increase the value\nof such acquired companies or assets and result in increased contingent deferred payments or other payment obligations for Federated, which can affect Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nImpairment Risk. At December 31, 2019, Federated had intangible assets including goodwill totaling $1.2 billion on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, the vast majority of which represents assets capitalized in connection with Federated's acquisitions and business combinations. Federated may not realize the value of these assets. Management performs an annual review of the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and periodic reviews of the carrying values of all other assets to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that an impairment in value may have occurred. A variety of factors could cause the carrying value of an asset to become impaired. Should a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the asset would occur, resulting in a noncash charge which would adversely affect Federated's financial position and results of operations for the period.\nSystems, Technology and Cybersecurity Risks. Federated utilizes software and related technologies throughout its business (both domestically and internationally) including, for example, both proprietary systems and those provided by outside service providers (or vendors). Service providers to, and customers of, Federated and its products, and third parties on which such service providers and customers rely, also utilize software and related technologies in their businesses. Federated continues to increase its investment in systems and technology, including externally hosted systems and technology, for investment management and trading operations, information and data management, disaster recovery, compliance and other areas of its business, and is exploring innovative technological solutions and products involving artificial intelligence and financial technology. Unanticipated issues could occur with any software, system or other technology and it is not possible to predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from a failure of Federated or a third party to address technology or computer system problems. Along with cyber incidents described more fully below, data or model imprecision, software or other technology malfunctions, human error, programming inaccuracies and similar or other circumstances or events may impair the performance of systems and technology. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that potential system interruptions, other technology-related issues or the cost necessary to rectify the problems would not have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation and business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, like other companies in the investment management industry and elsewhere, Federated's business relies on the security and reliability of information and communications technology, systems and networks. Federated uses digital technology, including, for example, networked systems, email and the Internet, to conduct business operations and engage clients, customers, employees, products, accounts, shareholders and relevant service providers, among others. The use of the Internet and other electronic media, computers and technology exposes Federated, its business, its products and strategies and services, customers, and relevant service providers, and their respective operations, to potential risks from frequent cybersecurity attacks, events or incidents (cyber incidents). For example, Federated and relevant service providers collect, maintain and transmit confidential, proprietary and non-public personal customer and employee information (such as in connection with online account access and performing investment, reconciliation, transfer agent, custodian and other recordkeeping and related functions) that can be targeted by cyber incidents. Federated, as well as its products and certain service providers, also generate, compile and process information for purposes of preparing and making filings or reports to governmental agencies, and a cyber incident that impacts that information, or the generation and filing processes, may prevent required regulatory filings and reports from being made. Cyber incidents involving Federated or its products or service providers, regulators or exchanges to which confidential, personally identifiable or other information is reported or filed also may result in unauthorized disclosure or compromise of, or access to, such information.\nCyber incidents can result from intentional (or deliberate) attacks or unintentional events by insiders or third parties, including cybercriminals, competitors, nation-states and \"hacktivists,\" among others. Cyber incidents may include, for example, phishing, use of stolen access credentials, unauthorized access to systems, networks or devices (for example, through hacking activity), structured query language attacks, infection from or spread of malware, ransomware, computer viruses or other malicious software code, corruption of data, and attacks (including, but not limited to, denial-of-service attacks on websites) which shut down, disable, slow, impair or otherwise disrupt operations, business processes, technology, connectivity or website or internet access, functionality or performance. In addition to intentional cyber incidents, unintentional cyber incidents can occur (for example, the inadvertent release of confidential or non-public personal information).\nLike other companies, Federated has experienced, and will continue to experience, cyber incidents on a daily basis. As of December 31, 2019, cyber incidents have not had a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Cyber incidents can affect, potentially in a material way, Federated's relationships with its customers, employees, products, accounts, shareholders and relevant service providers. A cyber incident may cause Federated, its business, products or services, employees, customers, or relevant service providers, to lose proprietary, sensitive, confidential or non-public business, customer, employee or personal information, or intellectual property, suffer data corruption or business interruption, lose operational capacity (for example, the loss of the ability to process transactions, calculate NAVs,\nor allow the transaction of business, or other disruptions to operations), and/or fail to comply with applicable privacy and other laws. Among other potentially harmful effects, cyber incidents also may result in theft, unauthorized monitoring and failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems. Any cyber incident could cause lost revenues, the occurrence of other financial losses, diminished future cash flows, significant increases in compliance or other costs or expenses (such as costs associated with compliance with cybersecurity laws and regulations and with protection, detection, remediation and corrective measures), exposure to increased litigation and legal risks (such as regulatory actions and penalties, and breach of contract or other litigation-related fees and expenses), reputational damage, damage to competitiveness, stock price and shareholder value, and other negative or adverse impacts. Cyber incidents affecting issuers in which Federated's or its customers' assets are invested also could cause such investments to lose value. Any of these cyber incidents may become incrementally worse if they were to remain undetected for an extended period of time. The operating systems of Federated, its products, its customers and relevant service providers are dependent on the effectiveness of information security policies and procedures which seek to ensure that such systems are protected from cyber incidents. Federated has established a committee to oversee Federated's information security and data governance efforts, and updates on cyber incidents and risks are reviewed with relevant committees, as well as Federated's Board of Directors (or a committee thereof), on a periodic (generally quarterly) basis (and more frequently when circumstances warrant) as part of risk management oversight responsibilities. Federated has, and believes its products and its service providers have, established risk management systems that are reasonably designed to seek to reduce the risks associated with cyber incidents. Federated employs various measures aimed at mitigating cyber risk, including, among others, use of firewalls, system segmentation, system monitoring, virus scanning, periodic penetration testing, employee phishing training and an employee cybersecurity awareness campaign. Among other vendor management efforts, Federated also conducts due diligence on key service providers (or vendors) relating to cybersecurity. However, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful, either entirely or partially, as there are limits on Federated's ability to prevent, detect or mitigate cyber incidents. Among other reasons, the cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving, the nature of malicious cyber incidents is becoming increasingly sophisticated and Federated, and its relevant affiliates and products, cannot control the systems and cybersecurity systems and practices of issuers, relevant service providers or other third parties. Federated's risk from cyber incidents also can increase as a result of expansion into new markets, domestic or international acquisitions, new technology, or previously unexploited vulnerabilities in software or related patches becoming activated (or \"weaponized\") by hackers. While Federated has obtained cyber-insurance, there is no guarantee that a particular incident would be covered by such insurance. In certain circumstances, insurance coverage may not be available or deductible amounts may not be exceeded, and Federated or the Federated Funds may have to bear the costs related to claims or any losses or other liabilities resulting from a cyber incident. While Federated cannot predict the financial or reputational impact to its business resulting from any cyber incident, depending upon the nature, magnitude and severity of a cyber incident, the occurrence of a cyber incident, or a similar situation or incident, could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, its reputation), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. The internal and external resources and efforts necessary to implement system and technology upgrades, data governance and cybersecurity policies, procedures and measures, including, for example, technology, systems, skilled personnel and service providers (or vendors), as well as vendor management, have, and will continue to, increase Federated's operating expenses, and can adversely affect, potentially in a material way, Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Reputational Harm. Any material losses in customer (including shareholder) confidence in Federated, its products or strategies or in the mutual fund industry as a result of actual or potential regulatory proceedings or litigation, economic or financial market downturns or disruptions, material errors in public news reports, allegations of trade name, trade mark or other intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, allegations of breaches of fiduciary duty, misconduct or unprofessional, unethical or illegal behavior, abuse of authority, a cyber incident, rumors on the Internet or other matters could increase redemptions from and/or reduce sales of Federated's products (such as the Federated Funds) and strategies and other investment management products and services and/or negatively impact Federated's brand, culture, trusted status, reputation and/or stock price. If such losses were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. There also is no guarantee that Federated's rebranding efforts will be successful. With increased focus from shareholders on sustainability, environmental, social, and governance matters by shareholders, any perceived deficiency in Federated's policies and practices on these matters may impact Federated's brand, reputation or stock price, as well as investor preference for Federated's securities, products, strategies and services, and, accordingly, adversely affect, potentially in a material way, Federated's stock price and business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Termination or Failure to Renew Advisory Agreements. A substantial majority of Federated's revenues are derived from investment advisory agreements with Federated Funds (and to a lesser extent, sub-advised mutual funds) registered under the 1940 Act that, as required by law, are terminable upon 60 days' notice. In addition, each such investment advisory agreement must be approved and renewed annually by each mutual fund's board of directors or trustees,\nincluding independent members of the board, or its shareholders, as required by law. Failure to renew, changes resulting in lower fees under, or termination of, certain or a significant number of, these agreements could have a material adverse impact on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. As required by the 1940 Act, each investment advisory agreement with a mutual fund automatically terminates upon its assignment, although new investment advisory agreements may be approved by the mutual fund's directors or trustees and shareholders. A sale or other transfer of a sufficient number of shares of Federated's voting securities to transfer control of Federated could be deemed an assignment in certain circumstances. An assignment, actual or constructive, will trigger these termination provisions and may adversely affect Federated's ability to realize the value of these agreements. Federated's investment advisory agreements for Separate Accounts that are not investment companies subject to the 1940 Act are generally terminable upon notice to Federated (or, in certain cases, after a 30 day, 60 day or similar notice period). As required by the Advisers Act, investment advisory agreements for Separate Accounts that are not investment companies subject to the 1940 Act also provide that consent is required from Federated's customers before the agreements may be assigned and an assignment, actual or constructive, also will trigger these consent requirements and may adversely affect Federated's ability to realize the value of these agreements. Regarding the investment advisory agreements with non-U.S. registered Federated Funds, shareholder notice or consent can be required if, after an investment advisory agreement is entered into, there are changes to fees, and such investment advisory agreements are generally terminable for any reason, without cause, after a 30-day to 90-day notice period. Customer consent to amend investment advisory agreements for non-U.S. Separate Accounts can be required for amendments to such agreements, and such agreements also are generally terminable for any reason, without cause, after a 30-day to 90-day notice period.\nUnder the terms of a 2005 settlement agreement with the SEC and New York State Attorney General, as amended, a Federated investment advisory subsidiary may not serve as investment advisor to any registered investment company unless: (1) at least 75% of the fund's directors are independent of Federated; (2) the chairman of each such fund is independent of Federated; and (3) no action may be taken by the fund's board of directors or trustees or any committee thereof unless approved by a majority of the independent board members of the fund or committee, respectively.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Unpredictable Events or Consequences. Unpredictable events, such as a natural disaster, pandemic (e.g., the coronavirus outbreak), war, terrorist attack or other business continuity event, or unexpected market, economic or political developments, could adversely impact Federated's, its products', its customers' and their respective service providers' (or vendors') ability to conduct business. Such events or consequences could cause disruptions in economic conditions and financial markets, governmental processes, system interruption, loss of life, unavailability of personnel, an inability to provide information or services, either at all or in accordance with applicable requirements, standards, or restrictions, and/or additional costs. For example, the current outbreak of the coronavirus, which was impossible to predict, has affected travel to China and led to global economic uncertainty which has impacted markets negatively. Given that the region is an important component of Federated's global distribution strategy, any scenario whereby the current situation persists for any significant period of time may adversely affect the potential business and, in turn, returns of Federated. Among other effects, market disruptions and the other events can cause a decline in the value of investments and a decline in the value of Federated's AUM, which tends to result in lower revenue for Federated. There also may be times when industry databases or other third parties publish or distribute information regarding Federated, or its products or services (including Federated Fund asset levels), that may be inaccurate or incomplete, and there can be no assurance that a third party will interpret or report information accurately. Unpredictable consequences, or side effects, of certain known or planned events, such as the planned phase-out of the LIBOR to SOFR, SONIA or another alternative interest rate expected to occur in 2021, also could adversely impact Federated's, its products', its customers', and their respective service providers' (or vendors') ability to conduct business. The SEC staff has indicated that the expected discontinuation of LIBOR could have a significant impact on the financial markets and may present a material risk for certain market participants, including public companies, investment advisers, investment companies and broker dealers. The phase-out of LIBOR may cause the renegotiation or re-pricing of certain credit facilities, derivatives or other financial transactions to which Federated, its products, customers or service providers are parties, alter the accounting treatment of certain instruments or transactions, or have other unintended consequences, which, among other effects, could require additional internal and external resources to address these effects thereby increasing operating expenses. While it is expected that market participants will amend financial instruments referencing LIBOR to include fallback provisions and/or other measures that contemplate the discontinuation of LIBOR or other similar market disruption events, neither the effect of the transition process nor the viability of such measures is known. While market participants have begun transitioning away from LIBOR, there are obstacles to converting certain longer term securities and transactions to a new benchmark or benchmarks. The effectiveness of multiple alternative reference rates as opposed to one primary reference rate has not been determined, nor has the effectiveness of alternative reference rates used in new or existing financial instruments and products. As market participants transition away from LIBOR, LIBOR's usefulness may deteriorate, which could occur prior to the end of 2021. The transition process may lead to increased volatility and illiquidity in markets that currently rely on LIBOR to determine interest rates. LIBOR's deterioration may adversely affect the liquidity and/or market value of securities that use LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate, including securities and other financial instruments held by Federated or the Federated\nFunds. Further, the utilization of an alternative reference rate, or the transition process to an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect Federated's or the Federated Funds' performance. As such, there can be no assurance that unpredictable or unexpected events, reports or consequences, or the costs to address such events, inaccurate reports or consequences, would not have a material adverse effect on Federated's business (including, but not limited to, business prospects), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Auditor Independence. Public companies, such as Federated, utilize the audit services of a registered public accounting firm (Accounting Firm) to audit or review their financial statements included in certain public filings, such as their Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The Accounting Firm is required to make a determination that such firm satisfies certain independence requirements under the federal securities laws. Like other public companies, there is a risk that activities or relationships of the Accounting Firm engaged by Federated, or such firm's partners or employees, can prevent a determination from being made that such firm satisfies such independence requirements with respect to Federated, which could render such firm ineligible to serve as Federated's independent Accounting Firm. Since Federated's independent Accounting Firm, like the Accounting Firms of many other public companies that sponsor and advise investment funds, acts in a similar capacity to several Federated Funds sponsored and advised by Federated, if a determination cannot be made that the Accounting Firm satisfies the independence requirements with respect to an applicable Federated Fund, the Accounting Firm also could be prevented from making a determination that it satisfies the independence requirements with respect to Federated, since Federated is an affiliate (i.e., the ultimate parent company) of the investment advisor to the relevant Federated Fund.\nFor example, Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (Loan Rule) prohibits Accounting Firms, or covered person professionals within the firms, from having certain financial relationships with their audit clients and affiliated entities. Federated's independent Accounting Firm, Ernst & Young LLP (EY), has advised Federated that under the then existing version of the Loan Rule (and may in the future advise Federated that under the amended Loan Rule discussed below) EY or covered person professionals within the firm have lending relationships with certain lenders where the lenders, or their affiliates that control them, own beneficially or of record greater than 10% of the equity securities of certain Federated Funds which could prevent a determination that the firm satisfies the independence requirements.\nOn June 18, 2019, the SEC adopted amendments to the Loan Rule relating to the analysis that must be conducted to determine whether an Accounting Firm is independent when the Accounting Firm (or covered person professionals within the firm) has a lending relationship with certain shareholders of an audit client, such as Federated or the Federated Funds. The amendments focus the analysis on beneficial ownership rather than on both record and beneficial ownership; replace the existing 10% bright-line shareholder ownership test with a significant influence test; add a known-through-reasonable-inquiry standard with respect to identifying beneficial owners of the audit client's equity securities; and exclude from the definition of audit client, for a fund under audit, any other funds that otherwise would be considered affiliates of the audit client under the rules for certain lending relationships. Under the Loan Rule amendments, a beneficial owner with whom an Accounting Firm (or a covered person professional within the firm) has a lending relationship would only have significant influence with respect to Federated or a Federated Fund (when Federated or the Federated Fund is an audit client of the Accounting Firm) if the beneficial owner has the ability to exert significant influence over Federated's or the Federated Fund's operating and financial policies, based on the totality of the facts and circumstances. In the case of a Federated Fund, the beneficial owner would have to have the ability to influence the Federated Fund's investment policies and day-to-day portfolio management processes, including those governing the selection, purchase and sale, and valuation of investments, and the distribution of income and capital gains (collectively, investment processes). Given Federated's dual-class structure, under which the entire voting power of Federated is generally vested in the holder of the outstanding shares of the Class A Common Stock and its publicly listed Class B Common Stock generally do not have voting power except in limited circumstances, the Loan Rule amendments make it less likely that a beneficial owner of its publicly traded Class B Common Stock would have significant influence over its operating and financial policies. Given that a majority of the members of the Federated Funds' Board of Directors/Trustees are independent and the Federated Funds delegate investment discretion over their portfolios to registered advisory subsidiaries of Federated which act as the primary investment advisers to the Federated Funds, the Loan Rule amendments make it less likely that a beneficial owner of a Federated Funds' equity securities would have significant influence over a Federated Fund's investment processes. Federated believes the Loan Rule amendments are an improvement on the Loan Rule and mitigate (but not entirely eliminate) the risk that Federated's or the Federated Funds' auditors will inadvertently implicate the auditor independence rules.\nAmong other sources of potential violations of the auditor independence requirements, Rule 2-01(c)(1)(i)(A) of Regulation S-X (Investment Rule) prohibits the Accounting Firm, or covered person professionals and their immediate family members, from having certain direct investments in audit clients and affiliated entities. Due to acquisitions that result in inadvertent investments in the auditing client or funds or other products that it or its affiliates manage, or other circumstances, an Accounting Firm may violate the Investment Rule and be required to timely and appropriately remedy such violation such that the audit client can make a determination that it continues to believe that the Accounting Firm has the ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the Accounting Firm's audit and review services.\nThere can be no assurance that the circumstances in any particular case will satisfy applicable independence requirements under the federal securities laws such that EY will remain eligible to serve as the independent Accounting Firm to Federated. If it were to be determined that the independence requirements under the federal securities laws were not complied with regarding Federated, its previously filed Annual Reports on Form 10-K (including financial statements audited by EY) and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (including financial statements reviewed by EY) may not be considered compliant with the applicable federal securities laws. If it were to be determined that EY did not comply with the independence requirements, among other things, the financial statements audited by EY and the interim financial statements reviewed by EY may have to be audited and reviewed, respectively, by another independent Accounting Firm, Federated's eligibility to issue securities under its existing registration statements may be impacted and certain financial reporting and/or other covenants with, and representations and warranties to, Federated's lenders may be impacted. Similar issues would arise for a Federated Fund for which EY (or another Accounting Firm) serves as such Federated Fund's independent Accounting Firm if it were to be determined that EY (or such other Accounting Firm) was not in compliance with the independence requirements under the federal securities laws, with respect to such Federated Fund. In either case, such events could have a material adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nPotential Adverse Effects of Litigation, Investigations, Proceedings and Other Claims. Federated and the Federated Funds can be subject to routine, sweep and other examinations, inquiries, investigations, proceedings (administrative, regulatory, civil or otherwise) and other claims by its regulators (regulatory claims). Federated and the Federated Funds also can be subject to employee, former employee, customer, and other third-party, complaints, proceedings (such as civil litigation) and other claims (business-related claims). Among other factors, as Federated's business grows (whether organically or through acquisition or whether through new products, strategies or services being offered or through growth of existing products, strategies and services, or otherwise), the attention and resources devoted to compliance, and the possibility of noncompliance, also can increase. The attention and resources devoted to compliance, and the possibility of noncompliance, also can increase when Federated expands its use of ESG, sustainability, stewardship or other data inputs or investment techniques in providing its investment products, strategies and services, enters new countries or markets, and financial products and other investments, as well as when markets and technology increase in complexity. Federated has business-related claims asserted and threatened against it, and Federated and the Federated Funds are subject to certain regulatory claims (such as routine and sweep examinations and other inquiries), in the ordinary course of business. In addition, Federated and the Federated Funds may be subject to business-related claims, claims related to Federated sponsorship or management of, or inclusion of proprietary Federated Funds in, its 401(k) plan or other benefit plans, and administrative, regulatory or civil investigations and proceedings or other regulatory claims, outside of the ordinary course of business. Federated cannot assess or predict whether, when or what types of business-related claims, fiduciary claims or regulatory claims (collectively, claims) may be threatened or asserted, the types or amounts of damages or other remedies that may be sought (which may be material when threatened or asserted), whether claims that have been threatened will become formal asserted pending investigations, proceedings or litigation, or whether claims ultimately may be successful (whether through settlement or adjudication), entirely or in part, whether or not any such claims are threatened or asserted in or outside the ordinary course of business. Federated may be initially unable to accurately assess a claim's impact. Given that the outcome of any claim is inherently unpredictable and uncertain, a result may arise from time to time that adversely impacts, potentially in a material way, Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. In certain circumstances, insurance coverage may not be available or deductible amounts may not be exceeded, and Federated, the Federated Funds or Separate Accounts managed by Federated may have to bear the costs related to claims or any losses or other liabilities resulting from any such matters, or from the operation of Federated's business, products and services.\nFederated's Status as a Controlled Company. Federated has two classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock, which has voting power, and Class B Common Stock, which is non-voting except in certain limited circumstances. All of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock are held by the Voting Shares Irrevocable Trust for the benefit of certain members of the Donahue family. The three trustees of this trust are Federated's President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, J. Christopher Donahue, his brother, Thomas R. Donahue, Federated's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer and a director, and their mother, Rhodora J. Donahue. Accordingly, Federated qualifies as a \"controlled company\" under Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. As a controlled company, Federated qualifies for and relies upon exemptions from several NYSE corporate governance requirements, including requirements that: (1) a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors; and (2) the entity maintains a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities. As a result, Federated's board does not have a majority of independent directors nor does it maintain a nominating/corporate governance committee. Federated is also exempt as a \"controlled company\" from certain additional independence requirements and responsibilities regarding compensation advisors applicable to Compensation Committee members.
