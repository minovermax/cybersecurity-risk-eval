RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to invest in the shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the case of such an event, the trading price of our common stock may decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe may not be able to execute our opportunistic buying, adequately manage our supply of inventory or anticipate customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to strategically source a sufficient volume and variety of brand name merchandise at opportunistic pricing. We do not have significant control over the supply, design, function, cost or availability of many of the products that we offer for sale in our stores. Additionally, because a substantial amount of our store products are sourced by us from suppliers on a closeout basis or with significantly reduced prices for specific reasons, we are not always able to purchase specific merchandise on a recurring basis. We do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers and therefore, we have no contractual assurances of pricing or access to products, and any supplier could discontinue sales to us at any time or offer us less favorable terms on future transactions. We generally make individual purchase decisions for products that become available, and these purchases may be for large quantities that we may not be able to sell on a timely or cost-effective basis. Due to economic uncertainties, some of our suppliers may cease operations or may otherwise become unable to continue supplying discounted or closeout merchandise on terms or in quantities acceptable to us.\nWe also compete with other retailers, wholesalers and jobbers for discounted or closeout merchandise to sell in our stores. Although we work with a range of suppliers, to the extent that certain of our suppliers are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory, the amount of discount or closeout merchandise available to us could also be materially reduced, potentially compromising profit margin goals for procured merchandise.\nShortages or disruptions in the availability of brand name or unbranded products of a quality acceptable to our customers and us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and also may result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, we may significantly overstock products that prove to be undesirable and be forced to take significant markdowns. We cannot assure that our merchant team will continue to identify the appropriate customer demand and take advantage of appropriate buying opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to generate revenues is dependent on consumer confidence and spending, which may be subject to factors beyond our control, including changes in economic and political conditions.\nThe success of our business depends, to a significant extent, upon the level of consumer confidence and spending. A number of factors beyond our control affect the level of customer confidence and spending on merchandise that we offer, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nenergy and gasoline prices;\n\u2022\ndisposable income of our customers;\n\u2022\ndiscounts, promotions and merchandise offered by our competitors;\n\u2022\npersonal debt levels of our customers;\n\u2022\nnegative reports and publicity about the discount retail industry;\n\u2022\nunemployment levels;\n\u2022\nminimum wages;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nfood prices;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\nthe state of the housing market;\n\u2022\ncustomer confidence in future economic conditions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the financial markets;\n\u2022\ntax rates and policies;\n\u2022\noutbreak of viruses or widespread illness; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, war, terrorism and other hostilities.\nReduced customer confidence and spending cut backs may result in reduced demand for our merchandise, including discretionary items, and may force us to take inventory markdowns. Reduced demand also may require increased selling and promotional expenses. Adverse economic conditions and any related decrease in customer demand for our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of the factors identified above also affect commodity rates, transportation costs, costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, the strength of the U.S. dollar, lease costs, measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors, all of which may impact our cost of goods sold and our selling, general and administrative expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition which could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our financial performance.\nWe compete with a highly fragmented group of competitors including discount, closeout, mass merchant, department, grocery, drug, convenience, hardware, variety, online and other specialty stores. We compete with these retailers with respect to price, store location, supply and quality of merchandise, assortment and presentation and customer service. This competitive environment subjects us to the risk of an adverse impact to our financial performance because of the lower prices, and thus the lower margins, that are required to maintain our competitive position. A number of different competitive factors outside of our control could impact our ability to compete effectively, including:\n\u2022\nentry of new competitors in our markets;\n\u2022\nincreased operational efficiencies of competitors;\n\u2022\nonline retail capabilities by our competitors;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing strategies, including deep discount pricing by a broad range of retailers during periods of poor customer confidence, low discretionary income or economic uncertainty;\n\u2022\ncontinued and prolonged promotional activity by our competitors;\n\u2022\nliquidation sales by our competitors that have filed or may file in the future for bankruptcy;\n\u2022\ngeographic expansion by competitors into markets in which we currently operate; and\n\u2022\nadoption by existing competitors of innovative store formats or retail sales methods.\nA number of our competitors also have greater financial and operational resources, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories and broader geographic presences than us. We remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of customer recognition of these larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could attract our customer base, including members of Ollie\u2019s Army.\nIn addition, if any of our competitors were to consolidate their operations, such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions, as well as result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by these consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to successfully compete against existing or future competitors. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, improved performance by our competitors and changes in the retail markets could result in lost market share and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to retain the loyalty of our customers, particularly Ollie\u2019s Army members, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our loyal customer base, particularly members of Ollie\u2019s Army, for our consistent sales and sales growth. Competition for customers has intensified as competitors have moved into, or increased their presence in, our geographic markets and from the use of mobile and web-based technology that facilitates online shopping and real-time product and price comparisons. We expect this competition to continue to increase. Our competitors may be able to offer consumers promotions or loyalty program incentives that could attract Ollie\u2019s Army members or divide their loyalty among several retailers. If we are unable to retain the loyalty of our customers, our net sales could decrease and we may not be able to grow our store base as planned, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to open new profitable stores on a timely basis or successfully enter new markets, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nOur primary growth strategy is to open new profitable stores and expand our operations into new geographic regions. We opened 27 and 22 net new stores in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively, as we continue to backfill in existing markets and expand into contiguous geographies. Our ability to timely open new stores depends in part on several factors, including the availability of attractive rents and store locations; the absence of occupancy delays; the ability to negotiate acceptable lease terms; our ability to obtain permits and licenses; our ability to hire and train new personnel, especially store managers, in a cost effective manner; our ability to adapt our distribution and other operational and management systems to a changing network of stores; the availability of capital funding for expansion; our ability to respond to demographic shifts in areas where our stores are located and general economic conditions.\nWe may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations into new geographic markets. Some new stores may be located in areas with different competitive and market conditions, customer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. We may face a higher cost of entry, alternative customer demands, reduced brand recognition and minimal operating experience in these areas. Although we are extremely sensitive to cannibalizing existing stores, opening new stores in our established markets may also result in inadvertent oversaturation, sales volume transfer from existing stores to new stores and reduced comparable store sales, thus adversely affecting our overall financial performance. We may not manage our expansion effectively, and our failure to achieve or properly execute our expansion plans could limit our growth or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our executive officers, our merchant team and other key personnel. If we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers, our merchant team and other key personnel. The loss of services of any of our executive officers, particularly Mark Butler, our co-founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, could materially adversely affect our business and operations. Competition for skilled and experienced management in the retail industry is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including our merchant team who is responsible for purchasing and negotiating the terms of our merchandise. Failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFactors such as inflation, cost increases and energy prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture increases in costs, such as the cost of merchandise, shipping rates, freight costs and store occupancy costs, may reduce our profitability, given our pricing model. These cost increases may be the result of inflationary pressures which could further reduce our sales or profitability. Increases in other operating costs, including changes in energy prices, wage rates and lease and utility costs, may increase our cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses. Our low price model and competitive pressures in our industry may have the effect of inhibiting our ability to reflect these increased costs in the prices of our products and therefore reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not successful in managing our inventory balances, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inventory balance represented approximately 71.4% of our total assets exclusive of goodwill, trade name and other intangible assets, net, as of January 30, 2016. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our profitability and ability to generate revenue. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet our customers\u2019 demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods adversely impact our results of operations. If our buying decisions do not accurately correspond to customer preferences, if we inappropriately price products or if our expectations about customer spending levels are inaccurate, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of any excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our inventory management. If we are not successful in managing our inventory balances, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in the implementation of our long-term business strategy, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur success depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy. Our ability to successfully implement our business strategies depends upon a significant number of factors, including but not limited to our ability to:\n\u2022\nexpand our store base and increase our customers;\n\u2022\naccess an adequate supply of quality brand name and closeout merchandise from suppliers at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nachieve profitable sales and to make adjustments as market conditions change;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of our marketing and merchandise strategies;\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressures in our industry;\n\u2022\nattract and retain store-level and management-level associates;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our management team can properly respond to the dynamics and demands of our market;\n\u2022\nmaintain our relationships with our suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nachieve positive cash flow, particularly during our peak inventory build-ups in advance of the holiday sales season; and\n\u2022\nadapt to any revised or new strategic initiatives and organizational structure.\nAny failure to achieve any or all of our business strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain highly qualified managerial personnel and sales associates in our stores and our distribution centers, our sales, financial performance and business operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe focus on providing our customers with a memorable and engaging shopping experience. To grow our operations and meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified store management personnel and sales associates, while controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, governmental bodies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations Board, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, the impact of legislation governing labor and employee relations or benefits, such as the Affordable Care Act, health insurance costs and our ability to maintain good relations with our associates. We compete with other retail businesses for many of our store management personnel and sales associates in hourly and part-time positions. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. We also rely on associates in our distribution centers to ensure the efficient processing and delivery of products from our suppliers to our stores. If we are unable to attract and retain quality sales associates and management personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business requires that we lease substantial amounts of space and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to lease space on terms as favorable as the leases negotiated in the past.\nWe do not own any real estate. We lease all of our store locations, our corporate headquarters and our distribution facilities in York, PA and Commerce, GA. Our stores are leased from third parties, with typical initial lease terms of five to seven years with options to renew for three successive five-year periods. We believe that we have been able to negotiate favorable rental rates over the last few years due in large part to the general state of the economy, the increased availability of vacant big box retail sites and our careful identification of favorable lease opportunities. While we will continue to seek out advantageous lease opportunities, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to find low-cost second generation sites or obtain favorable lease terms. Many of our lease agreements have defined escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions. Increases in our occupancy costs and difficulty in identifying economically suitable new store locations could have significant negative consequences, which include:\n\u2022\nrequiring that a greater portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes and reducing profitability;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business or in the industry in which we compete.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses and needs and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which could harm our business. Additional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancelable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under that lease. In addition, if we are not able to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of, or disruption in the operations of, our centralized distribution centers could materially adversely affect our business and operations.\nWith few exceptions, our entire inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our two distribution centers in York, PA, and Commerce, GA, where the inventory is then processed, sorted and shipped to our stores. We depend in large part on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of our distribution centers. Increases in transportation costs (including increases in fuel costs), supplier-side delays, reductions in the capacity of carriers, changes in shipping companies, labor strikes or shortages in the transportation industry and unexpected delivery interruptions also have the potential to derail our orderly distribution process. We also may not anticipate changing demands on our distribution system, including the effect of expanding operations in our distribution center in Commerce, GA. In addition, events beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events or labor disagreements, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores. While we maintain business interruption insurance, in the event our distribution centers are shut down for any reason, such insurance may not be sufficient, and any related insurance proceeds may not be timely paid to us. In addition, our new store locations receiving shipments may be further away from our distribution centers which may increase transportation costs and may create transportation scheduling strains. Any repeated, intermittent, or long-term disruption in the operations of our distribution centers would hinder our ability to provide merchandise to our stores and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur new store growth is dependent upon our ability to successfully expand our distribution network capacity, and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect our performance adversely.\nWe maintain distribution centers in York, PA and Commerce, GA to support our existing stores and our growth objectives. We continuously assess ways to maximize the productivity and efficiency of our existing distribution facilities and evaluate opportunities for additional distribution centers. Should we open additional distribution centers, delays in such openings could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth, which could, in turn, reduce sales growth. In addition, any distribution related construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns, such as, shortages of materials, shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages, unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems, weather interference, fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases. The completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction related or other reasons. We cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets.\nWe do not compete in the growing online retail marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur long-term business strategy does not presently include the development of online retailing capabilities. To the extent that we implement online operations, we would incur substantial expenses related to such activities and be exposed to additional cybersecurity risks. Further, any development of an online retail marketplace is a complex undertaking, and there is no guarantee that any resources we apply to this effort will result in increased revenues or operating performance. With the growing acceptance of online shopping and the increased proliferation of mobile computing devices, however, competition from other retailers in the online retail marketplace is expected to increase. Certain of our competitors and a number of pure online retailers have established robust online operations. Increased competition from online retailers and our lack of online retail presence may reduce our customers\u2019 desire to purchase goods from us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon our marketing, advertising and promotional efforts. If we are unable to implement them successfully, or if our competitors are more effective than we are, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use marketing and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores and to encourage purchases by our customers. Although we use various media for our promotional efforts, including regular and Ollie\u2019s Army mailers, email campaigns, radio and television advertisements and sports marketing, we primarily advertise our in-store offerings through printed flyers. In fiscal year 2015, approximately 70% of our advertising spend was for the printing and distribution of flyers. If the efficacy of printed flyers as an advertising medium declines, or if we fail to successfully develop and implement new marketing, advertising and promotional strategies, such as an effective social media strategy, our competitors may be able to attract the interest of our customers, which could reduce customer traffic in our stores. Changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity or merchandising strategy by our competitors could cause us to have difficulties in retaining existing customers and attracting new customers. If the efficacy of our marketing or promotional activities declines or if such activities of our competitors are more effective than ours, or if for any other reason we lose the loyalty of our customers, including our Ollie\u2019s Army members, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to protect our brand names, competitors may adopt trade names that dilute the value of our brand name.\nWe may be unable or unwilling to strictly enforce our trademarks in each jurisdiction in which we do business. Also, we may not always be able to successfully enforce our trademarks against competitors or against challenges by others. Our failure to successfully protect our trademarks could diminish the value and efficacy of our brand recognition and could cause customer confusion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our business is seasonal, with the highest volume of net sales during the holiday season, adverse events during our fourth quarter could materially adversely affect our business, operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe generally recognize our highest volume of net sales in connection with the holiday sales season, which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. In anticipation of the holiday sales season, we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hire many part-time associates. Because a significant percentage of our net sales and operating income are generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, we have limited ability to compensate for shortfalls in our fourth fiscal quarter sales or earnings by changing our operations or strategies in other fiscal quarters. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unanticipated adverse weather conditions could result in lower-than-planned sales during the holiday sales season. If our fourth fiscal quarter sales results were substantially below expectations, we would realize less cash from operations, and may be forced to mark down our merchandise, especially our seasonal merchandise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in comparable store sales and results of operations, including fluctuations on a quarterly basis, could cause our business performance to decline substantially.\nOur results of operations have fluctuated in the past, including on a quarterly basis, and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future.\nOur comparable store sales and results of operations are affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nnational and regional economic trends in the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in gasoline prices;\n\u2022\nchanges in our merchandise mix;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing;\n\u2022\nchanges in the timing of promotional and advertising efforts;\n\u2022\nholidays or seasonal periods; and\n\u2022\nweather.\nIf our future comparable store sales fail to meet expectations, then our cash flow and profitability could decline substantially, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on manufacturers in foreign countries for merchandise and a significant amount of our domestically-purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. Our business may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with international trade.\nWe purchase merchandise directly from suppliers outside of the United States. In fiscal year 2015, substantially all of our private label inventory purchases were direct imports. Our direct imports represented approximately 18% at cost of our total merchandise\npurchases in fiscal year 2015. Additionally, a significant amount of our domestically-purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. Our ability to identify qualified suppliers and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outside of North America. Global sourcing and foreign trade involve numerous factors and uncertainties beyond our control including increased shipping costs, increased import duties, more restrictive quotas, loss of most favored nation trading status, currency, work stoppages, transportation delays, port of entry issues, economic uncertainties such as inflation, foreign government regulations, political unrest, natural disasters, war, terrorism, trade restrictions, political instability, the financial stability of vendors, merchandise quality issues, and tariffs. Moreover, negative press or reports about internationally manufactured products may sway public opinion, and thus customer confidence, away from the products sold in our stores. These and other issues affecting our international vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements. A significant change in, or noncompliance with, these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe routinely incur significant costs in complying with federal, state, local laws and regulations. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are increasing due to expanding and additional legal and regulatory requirements and increased enforcement efforts. New laws or regulations, including those dealing with healthcare reform, product safety, consumer credit, privacy and information security and labor and employment, among others, or changes in existing laws and regulations, particularly those governing the sale of products and food safety and quality (including changes in labeling or disclosure requirements), federal or state wage requirements, employee rights, health care, social welfare or entitlement programs such as health insurance, paid leave programs, or other changes in workplace regulation, may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and/or could materially increase our cost of doing business. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in the imposition of penalties, including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties, class action litigation or other litigation, in addition to reputational damage. Additionally, changes in tax laws, the interpretation of existing laws, or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain or upgrade our information technology systems or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient.\nWe depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business. We rely on certain hardware, telecommunications and software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business. Various components of our information technology systems, including hardware, networks, and software, are licensed to us by third party vendors. We rely extensively on our information technology systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Additionally, because we accept debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (the \u201cPCI Standard\u201d), issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. The PCI Standard contains compliance guidelines with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data. We are in compliance with the PCI Standard as of the end of fiscal year 2015, and compliance with the PCI Standard and implementing related procedures, technology and information security measures requires significant resources and ongoing attention. Costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology such as those necessary to achieve compliance with the PCI Standard or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our payment-related systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them. If there are amendments to the PCI Standard, the cost of re-compliance could also be substantial and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations as a result. In addition, we may have to upgrade our existing information technology systems from time to time, in order for such systems to withstand the increasing needs of our expanding business. Any material interruption experienced by our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Costs and potential interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of our existing systems could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our business.\nAny disruptions to our information technology systems or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations, compromise our reputation, expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the integrity, security and successful functioning of our information technology systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including point-of-sale processing at our stores. In connection with sales, we transmit encrypted confidential credit and debit card information.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2015, we are compliant with the PCI Standard. However, there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to operate our facilities and our customer service and sales operations in accordance with PCI or other industry recommended or contractually required practices. We expect to incur additional expenses to maintain PCI compliance. Even though we are compliant with such standards, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches.\nWe also have access to, collect or maintain private or confidential information regarding our customers, associates and suppliers, as well as our business. The protection of our customer, associates, supplier and company data is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across our business. In addition, customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attack or other security breaches. We have procedures in place to safeguard such data and information. However, a significant breach of customer, employee, supplier, or company data could attract a substantial amount of negative media attention, damage our customer and supplier relationships and our reputation, and result in lost sales, fines and/or lawsuits.\nAn increasingly significant portion of our sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems, including but not limited to our point-of-sale system and our credit card processing systems. Our information technology, communication systems and electronic data may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, acts of war or terrorist attacks, floods, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, power loss and outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, unauthorized data breaches, usage errors by our associates or our contractors or other attempts to harm our systems, including cyber-security attacks or other breaches of cardholder data. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our systems, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services and non-compliance with certain regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost of compliance with product safety regulations and risks related to product liability claims and product recalls could damage our reputation, increase our cost of doing business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew federal or state legislation, including new product safety laws and regulations, may negatively impact our operations. Future changes in product safety legislation or regulations may lead to product recalls and the disposal or write-off of merchandise. While we work to comply in all material respects with applicable legislation and regulations, and to execute product recalls in a timely manner, if our merchandise, including food and consumable products and flooring, does not meet applicable governmental safety standards or our customers\u2019 expectations regarding quality or safety, we could experience lost sales and increased costs, be exposed to legal and reputational risk and face fines or penalties which could materially adversely affect our financial results. We also purchase a material portion of our products on a closeout basis. Some of these products are obtained through brokers or intermediaries rather than through manufacturers. The closeout nature of a portion of our products sometimes makes it more difficult for us to investigate all aspects of these products. Furthermore, customers have asserted claims, and may in the future assert claims that they have sustained injuries from merchandise offered by us, and we may be subject to lawsuits relating to these claims. There is a risk that these claims may exceed, or fall outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification from third-party suppliers, such claims, even if unsuccessful or not fully pursued, could significantly damage our reputation and customer confidence in our products. If this occurs, it may be difficult for us to regain lost sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face litigation risks from customers, associates and other third parties in the ordinary course of business.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by customers, current and former associates, suppliers, stockholders, intellectual property rights holders, government agencies and others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant and may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required. There may also be negative publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of merchandise offerings, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nOur indebtedness may limit our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and if we are unable to comply with our financial covenants, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of January 30, 2016, we had $200.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured term loan facility (the \u201cNew Term Loan Facility\u201d) and $2.4 million of outstanding letters of credit and $0.2 million of outstanding rent reserves under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (of which $97.4 million of undrawn commitments remained available for borrowing) (the \u201cNew Revolving Credit Facility\u201d, and together with the New Term Loan Facility, the \u201cNew Credit Facilities\u201d). We may, from time to time, incur additional indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our New Credit Facilities place certain conditions on us, including that they:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under our New Credit Facilities are at variable rates;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to utilize our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development activity and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nOur New Credit Facilities place certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. However, subject to the qualifications and exceptions in our New Credit Facilities, we may be permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness and may incur obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under the terms of the New Credit Facilities. Our New Credit Facilities also place certain limitations on, among other things, our ability to enter into certain types of transactions, financing arrangements and investments, to make certain changes to our capital structure and to guarantee certain indebtedness. Our New Credit Facilities also place certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions and certain management fees. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our stock or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nsell stock in our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nmake certain payments or prepayments of indebtedness subordinated to our obligations under our New Credit Facilities; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nFailure to comply with certain covenants or the occurrence of a change of control under our New Credit Facilities could result in the acceleration of our obligations under the New Credit Facilities, which would materially adversely affect our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations.\nUnder certain circumstances, our New Credit Facilities require us to comply with certain financial covenants regarding our fixed charge coverage ratio and total leverage ratio. Changes with respect to the total leverage ratio may increase our interest rate and failure to comply with each covenant could result in a default and an acceleration of our obligations under the New Credit Facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facilities.\u201d\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future and is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, in the amounts projected or at all, or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal and interest payments in the future, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity. The terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our New Credit Facilities, may also restrict us from affecting any of these alternatives. Further, changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing, make it more difficult to obtain favorable terms, or restrict our access to these sources of future liquidity. If we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, whether or not caused by climate change, unusual weather condition, epidemic outbreaks, terrorist acts and political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods and earthquakes, unusual weather conditions, epidemic outbreaks such as Ebola or measles, terrorist attacks or disruptive political events in certain regions where our stores are located could adversely affect our business and result in lower sales. Severe weather, such as heavy snowfall or extreme temperatures, may discourage or restrict customers in a particular region from traveling to our stores, thereby reducing our sales and profitability. If severe weather conditions occur during the second or fourth quarter of our fiscal year, the adverse impact to our sales and profitability could be even greater than at other times during the year because we generate a larger portion of our sales and profits during this period. Natural disasters including tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes may damage our stores or other operations, which may materially adversely affect our consolidated financial results. To the extent these events also impact one or more of our key suppliers or result in the closure of one or both of our centralized distribution centers or our corporate headquarters, we may be unable to maintain inventory balances, maintain delivery schedules or provide other support functions to our stores. This could have a sustained material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur insurance coverage reflects deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations. However, there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of war, employee and certain other crime, wage and hour and other employment-related claims, including class actions, and some natural disasters. If we incur these losses and they are material, our business could suffer. Certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases. To offset negative insurance market trends, we may elect to self-insure, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our worker\u2019s compensation, general liability and group health insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses, including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store\nsupport center, distribution centers and stores, we are not self-insured for other property losses. With the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, we may experience an increase in participation in our group health insurance programs, which may lead to a greater number of medical claims. If we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInventory shrinkage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. Although our inventory shrinkage rates have not been material, or fluctuated significantly in recent years, we cannot assure you that actual rates of inventory loss and theft in the future will be within our estimates or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in \u201cItem 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to inventory valuation, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expense and accounting for income taxes including deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to existing accounting rules or regulations may impact our future results of operations or cause the perception that we are more highly leveraged. Other new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. For instance, accounting regulatory authorities have indicated that they may begin to require lessees to capitalize operating leases in their financial statements in the next few years. If adopted, such change would require us to record significant lease obligations on our consolidated balance sheet and make other changes to our financial statements. This and other future changes to accounting rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price could fluctuate significantly, which could cause the value of your investment in our common stock to decline.\nSecurities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. The market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our results of operations. The public market for our common stock is very new, and its trading price is likely to be volatile and subject to significant price fluctuations in response to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in customer preferences;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole and, in particular, in the retail environment;\n\u2022\nthe timing and expense of new store openings, renewals, remodels and relocations and the relative proportion of our new stores to existing stores;\n\u2022\nthe performance and successful integration of any new stores that we open;\n\u2022\nchanges in our merchandise mix and supplier base;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u2022\nentry into new geographic markets;\n\u2022\nour levels of comparable store sales;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nthe level of pre-opening expenses associated with new stores;\n\u2022\ninventory shrinkage beyond our historical average rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other retailers;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 perceptions of our prospects and the prospects of the retail industry;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in quarterly operating results, as well as differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nannouncements media reports or other public forum comments related to litigation, claims or reputational charges against us;\n\u2022\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or the failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from system failures and disruptions, earthquakes, hurricanes, war, acts of terrorism, other natural disasters or responses to these events; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. As a result of these factors, our quarterly and annual results of operations and comparable store sales may also fluctuate significantly. Accordingly, results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for any year and comparable store sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the future, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely decrease.\nIn the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, security holders have often instituted class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders or upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or stock options granted in the future may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly. As of January 30, 2016, CCMP, our private equity sponsor, held an aggregate of 34,603,040 shares of our common stock. After our secondary offering on February 18, 2016, CCMP held an aggregate of 27,701,518 shares of our common stock. In addition, as of January 30, 2016, we have an aggregate of 6,991,825 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, (the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d and together with the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan \u201cEquity Plans\u201d) (3,013,125 of which are fully vested). After our secondary offering on February 18, 2016, we have an aggregate of 5,839,325 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options under the Equity Plans (1,860,625 of which are fully vested).\nThe perception that such sales could occur could also depress the market price of our common stock. Any such sales could also create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and might also make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and pay any dividends.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than ownership of 100% of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Because we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, we depend on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, and to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in our New Credit Facilities and other agreements which may govern future indebtedness of our subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. The earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries might not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock or other obligations. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nThe continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. We do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements, legal requirements, earnings and other factors. Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the terms of our New Credit Facilities and might be restricted by the terms of any indebtedness that we incur in the future. Accordingly, realization of any gain on our common stock will depend on the appreciation of the price of the shares of our common stock, which may never occur.\nWe have and will continue to incur increased costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\nAs a new public company, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we have not incurred as a private company, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined under\nthe JOBS Act. We are required to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in Section 13 of the Exchange Act. We are also required to ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. In addition, we are subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including the requirements of the NASDAQ, and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\nAs a public company, we will, among other things:\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports and other stockholder communications in compliance;\n\u2022\ncomply with our obligations under the federal securities laws and applicable NASDAQ rules;\n\u2022\ncreate or expand the roles and duties of the Board and committees of the Board;\n\u2022\ninstitute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance functions;\n\u2022\nenhance our investor relations function;\n\u2022\nestablish new internal policies, including those relating to disclosure controls and procedures; and\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the activities listed above.\nThese changes will require a significant commitment of additional resources and many of our competitors already comply with these obligations. We may not be successful in complying with these obligations and the significant commitment of resources required for complying with them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, our Board committees or as our executive officers.\nIn addition, if we fail to implement the requirements with respect to our internal accounting and audit functions, our ability to report our results of operations on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired and we could suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violate the NASDAQ listing standards. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe changes necessitated by becoming a public company require a significant commitment of resources and management supervision that has increased and may continue to increase our costs and might place a strain on our systems and resources. As a result, our management\u2019s attention might be diverted from other business concerns. If we fail to maintain an effective internal control environment or to comply with the numerous legal and regulatory requirements imposed on public companies, we could make material errors in, and be required to restate, our financial statements. Any such restatement could result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions imposed on us by the SEC. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nOur management team historically managed a private company and the transition to managing a public company presents new challenges.\nSince July 2015, we have been subject to various regulatory requirements, including those of the SEC and the NASDAQ. These requirements include record keeping, financial reporting and corporate governance rules and regulations. We have not historically had the resources typically found in a public company. Our internal infrastructure may not be adequate to support our increased reporting obligations, and we may be unable to hire, train or retain necessary staff and may be reliant on engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome our lack of experience or employees. If our internal infrastructure is inadequate, we are unable to engage outside consultants or are otherwise unable to fulfill our public company obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur internal control over financial reporting does not currently meet the standards required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we file with the SEC as a public company, and generally requires in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years subsequent to becoming a public company. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation and the incurrence of significant additional expenditures.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have undertaken various actions, and may need to take additional actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. In connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. We will be unable to issue securities in the public markets through the use of a shelf registration statement if we are not in compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 404. Furthermore, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to obtain an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. To the extent we avail ourselves of these exemptions, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the market price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nCCMP and our Chief Executive Officer collectively own a substantial majority of our outstanding common stock and their interests may be different from or conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nAs of January 30, 2016, CCMP beneficially owns approximately 58.9% of our outstanding common stock and Mark Butler, our co-founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns approximately 24.5% of our outstanding common stock. After our secondary offering on February 18, 2016, CCMP beneficially owns approximately 46.2% of our outstanding common stock and Mark Butler, our co-founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns approximately 21.1% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, both CCMP and Mr. Butler are able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and any other significant transaction. Our principal stockholders\u2019 interests might not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. For instance, this concentration of ownership and/or the restrictions imposed by the stockholders agreement may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price.\nCCMP may acquire interests and positions that could present potential conflicts with our and our stockholders\u2019 interests.\nCCMP makes investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. CCMP may also pursue, for its own accounts, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities might not be available to us. Our organizational documents contain provisions renouncing any interest or expectancy held by our directors affiliated with CCMP in certain corporate opportunities. Accordingly, the interests of CCMP may supersede ours, causing CCMP or its affiliates to compete against us or to pursue opportunities instead of us, for which we have no recourse. Such actions on the part of CCMP and inaction on our part could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrently, three seats on our Board are occupied by full-time investment professionals of CCMP. Because CCMP could invest in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us, when conflicts arise between the interests of CCMP and the interests of our stockholders, these directors may not be disinterested.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022\nsubject to certain exceptions, require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by a majority of our Board or upon the request of the Chief Executive Officer;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board;\n\u2022\nestablish that our Board is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nIn addition, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which relate to business combinations with interested stockholders, do not apply to us, until the moment in time, if ever, immediately following the time at which both of the following conditions exist: (i) Section 203 by its terms would, but for the terms of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, apply to us and (ii) there occurs a transaction following the consummation of which CCMP no longer owns at least 5% or more of our issued and outstanding common stock entitled to vote. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, at such time, we will automatically become subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination transaction with an interested stockholder (a stockholder who owns more than 15% of our common stock) for a period of three years after the interested stockholder became such unless the transaction fits within an applicable exemption, such as board approval of the business combination or the transaction that resulted in such stockholder becoming an interested stockholder. These provisions apply even if the business combination could be considered beneficial by some stockholders. Although we have elected to opt out of the statute\u2019s provisions until the above conditions are met, we could elect to be subject to Section 203 in the future.\nIf securities analysts or industry analysts downgrade our shares, publish negative research or reports, or do not publish reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is to some extent influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. If no or few analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our stock could decrease. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more analysts adversely change their recommendation regarding our shares or our competitors\u2019 stock, our share price might decline. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we might lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 15535, "SIC": 5331, "TIC": "OLLI"}
