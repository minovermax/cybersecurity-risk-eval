{"cik": "315131", "company": "PANHANDLE OIL & GAS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-12-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating the Company\u2019s business and future prospects. If any of the following risk factors should occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition could be materially impacted, and the holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in Panhandle. The risk factors described below are not exhaustive, and investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to the Company and its business. Investors should also read the other information in this Form 10-K, including the financial statements and related notes.\nUncertainty of economic conditions, worldwide and in the United States, may have a significant negative effect on operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nEffects of change in domestic and international economic conditions could include: (1) an imbalance in supply and demand for oil, NGL and natural gas resulting in decreased oil, NGL and natural gas reserves due to curtailed drilling activity; (2) a decline in oil, NGL and natural gas prices; (3) risk of insolvency of well operators and oil, NGL and natural gas purchasers; (4) limited availability of certain insurance coverage; (5) limited access to derivative instruments; and (6) limited credit availability. A decline in reserves would lead to a decline in production, and either a production decline, or a decrease in oil, NGL and natural gas prices, would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cash flow, profitability and value.\nOil, NGL and natural gas prices are volatile. Volatility in these prices can adversely affect operating results and the price of the Company\u2019s common stock. This volatility also makes valuation of oil and natural gas producing properties difficult and can disrupt markets.\nThe supply of and demand for oil, NGL and natural gas impact the prices we realize on the sale of these commodities and, in turn, materially affect the Company\u2019s financial results. Oil, NGL and natural gas prices have historically been, and will likely continue to be, volatile. The prices for oil, NGL and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nworldwide economic conditions\n\u2022\neconomic, political, regulatory and tax developments\n\u2022\nmarket uncertainty\n\u2022\nchanges in the supply of and demand for oil, NGL and natural gas\n\u2022\navailability and capacity of necessary transportation and processing facilities\n\u2022\ncommodity futures trading\n(5)\n\u2022\nregional price differentials\n\u2022\ndiffering quality of oil produced (i.e., sweet crude versus heavy or sour crude)\n\u2022\ndiffering quality and NGL content of natural gas produced\n\u2022\nweather conditions\n\u2022\nthe level of imports and exports of oil, NGL and natural gas\n\u2022\npolitical instability or armed conflicts in major oil and natural gas producing regions\n\u2022\nactions taken by OPEC or other major oil, NGL and natural gas producing or consuming countries\n\u2022\ncompetition from alternative sources of energy\n\u2022\ntechnological advancements affecting energy consumption and energy supply\nPrice volatility makes it difficult to budget and project the return on investment in exploration and development projects and to estimate with precision the value of producing properties that are owned or acquired by the Company. In addition, volatile prices often disrupt the market for oil and natural gas properties, as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties. Revenues, results of operations, reserves and capital availability may fluctuate significantly as a result of variations in oil, NGL and natural gas prices and production performance.\nLower oil, NGL and natural gas prices may also trigger significant impairment write-downs on a portion of the Company\u2019s properties which negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, the credit available under its credit facility is affected by product prices.\nLow oil, NGL and natural gas prices for a prolonged period of time would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, access to capital and the quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas that may be economically produced would be negatively impacted if oil, NGL and natural gas prices are low for an extended period of time. The ways in which low prices could have a material negative effect include:\n\u2022\nsignificantly decrease the number of wells drilled by operators on the Company\u2019s acreage, thereby reducing our production and cash flows\n\u2022\ncash flow would be reduced, decreasing funds available for capital expenditures employed to replace reserves and maintain or increase production\n\u2022\nfuture undiscounted and discounted net cash flows from producing properties would decrease, possibly resulting in recognition of impairment expense\n(6)\n\u2022\ncertain reserves may no longer be economic to produce, leading to lower proved reserves, production and cash flow\n\u2022\naccess to sources of capital, such as equity and debt markets, could be severely limited or unavailable\n\u2022\nthe Company may incur a reduction in the borrowing base on its credit facility\nThe Company cannot control activities on its properties.\nThe Company does not operate any of the properties in which it has an interest and has very limited ability to exercise influence over the third-party operators of these properties. Our dependence on the third-party operators of our properties, and on the cooperation of other working interest owners in these properties, could negatively affect the following:\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s return on capital used in drilling or property acquisition\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s production and reserve growth rates\n\u2022\ncapital required to drill and complete wells\n\u2022\nsuccess and timing of drilling, development and exploitation activities on the Company\u2019s properties\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental, safety and other regulations\n\u2022\nlease operating expenses\n\u2022\nplugging and abandonment costs, including well-site restorations\nDependency on each operator\u2019s judgment, expertise and financial resources could result in unexpected future costs, lost revenues and/or capital restrictions, to the extent they would cumulatively have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s derivative activities may reduce the cash flow received for oil and natural gas sales.\nIn order to manage exposure to price volatility on our oil and natural gas production, we enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts for a portion of our expected production. Oil and natural gas price derivatives may limit the cash flow we actually realize and therefore reduce the Company\u2019s ability to fund future projects. None of our oil and natural gas price derivative contracts are designated as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, all changes in fair value of derivative contracts are reflected in earnings. Accordingly, these fair values may vary significantly from period to period, materially affecting reported earnings. The fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative instruments outstanding as of September 30, 2016, was a net liability of $428,271.\n(7)\nThere is risk associated with our derivative contracts that involves the possibility that counterparties may be unable to satisfy contractual obligations to us. If any counterparty to our derivative instruments were to default or seek bankruptcy protection, it could subject a larger percentage of our future oil and natural gas production to commodity price changes and could have a negative effect on our ability to fund future projects.\nPlease read Item 7A - \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d and Note 1 to the financial statements included in Item 8 - \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding derivative contracts.\nLower oil, NGL and natural gas prices or negative adjustments to oil, NGL and natural gas reserves may result in significant impairment charges.\nThe Company has elected to utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. Exploration expenses, including geological and geophysical costs, rentals and exploratory dry holes, are charged against income as incurred. Costs of successful wells and related production equipment and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized by property using the unit-of-production method (the ratio of oil, NGL and natural gas volumes produced to total proved or proved developed reserves) as oil, NGL and natural gas are produced.\nAll long-lived assets, principally the Company\u2019s oil and natural gas properties, are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset on our books may be greater than its future net cash flows. The need to test a property for impairment may result from declines in oil, NGL and natural gas sales prices or unfavorable adjustments to oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. Also, once assets are classified as held for sale, they are reviewed for impairment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, the Company cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded. If an impairment charge is recognized, cash flow from operating activities is not impacted, but net income and, consequently, shareholders\u2019 equity are reduced. In periods when impairment charges are incurred, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Note 1 to the financial statements included in Item 8 - \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data\u201d for further discussion on impairment under the heading \u201cDepreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Impairment.\u201d\n(8)\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nIt is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil, NGL and natural gas with precision. Oil, NGL and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil, NGL and natural gas using assumptions concerning future prices of these commodities, future production levels, and operating and development costs. In estimating our reserves, we and our Independent Consulting Petroleum Engineering Firm must make various assumptions with respect to many matters that may prove to be incorrect, including:\n\u2022\nfuture oil, NGL and natural gas prices\n\u2022\nproduction rates\n\u2022\nreservoir pressures, decline rates, drainage areas and reservoir limits\n\u2022\ninterpretation of subsurface conditions including geological and geophysical data\n\u2022\npotential for water encroachment or mechanical failures\n\u2022\nlevels and timing of capital expenditures, lease operating expenses, production taxes and income taxes, and availability of funds for such expenditures\n\u2022\neffects of government regulation\nIf any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our estimates of reserves, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and our estimates of the future net cash flows from our reserves could change significantly.\nOur standardized measure of oil and natural gas reserves is calculated using the 12-month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month individual product prices for each month within the 12-month period prior to September 30. These prices and the operating costs in effect as of the date of estimation are held flat over the life of the properties. From this calculation of future estimated development, production and income tax expenses are deducted with the result discounted at 10% per annum to reflect the timing of future net revenue in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates to take into account changes in our assumptions and the results of actual development and production.\n(9)\nThe reserve estimates made for fields that do not have a lengthy production history are less reliable than estimates for fields with lengthy production histories. A lack of production history may contribute to inaccuracy in our estimates of proved reserves, future production rates and the timing of development expenditures. Further, our lack of knowledge of all individual well information known to the well operators such as incomplete well stimulation efforts, restricted production rates for various reasons and up-to-date well production data, etc. may cause differences in our reserve estimates.\nBecause PUD reserves, under SEC reporting rules, may only be recorded if the wells they relate to are scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of recording, the removal of PUD reserves that are not developed within this five-year period may be required. Removals of this nature may significantly reduce the quantity and present value of the Company\u2019s oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. During 2016 we made 46.9 Bcfe of negative revisions to PUD reserves principally due to the removal of PUD locations and the associated reserves that are no longer projected to be developed within five years from the date they were added to the PUD reserves. These revisions were due to low commodity prices. Please read Item 2 - \u201cProperties - Proved Reserves\u201d and Note 11 to the financial statements included in Item 8 - \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nBecause forward-looking prices and costs are not used to estimate discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves, the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of our properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor used when calculating discounted future net cash flows, in compliance with the FASB statement on oil and natural gas producing activities disclosures, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the Company, or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nFailure to find or acquire additional reserves will cause reserves and production to decline materially from their current levels.\nThe rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. The Company\u2019s proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced except to the extent that the Company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, conducts additional successful exploration and development drilling, successfully applies new technologies or identifies additional behind-pipe zones (different productive zones within existing producing well bores) or secondary recovery reserves.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas invariably involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling, completion, operating and other costs. In addition, wells that are profitable may not achieve a targeted rate of return. The Company relies on third-party operators\u2019 interpretation of seismic data and other advanced technologies in identifying prospects\n(10)\nand in conducting exploration and development activities. Nevertheless, prior to drilling a well, the seismic data and other technologies used do not allow operators to know conclusively whether oil, NGL or natural gas is present in commercial quantities.\nCost factors can adversely affect the economics of any project, and ultimately the cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is controlled by well operators and existing market conditions. Further, drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions\n\u2022\ntitle problems\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in formations\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents\n\u2022\nfires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering\n\u2022\nlack of availability to market production via pipelines or other transportation\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards or liabilities\n\u2022\nlack of water disposal facilities\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations\n\u2022\ncost and availability of drilling rigs, equipment and services\n\u2022\nexpected sales price to be received for oil, NGL or natural gas produced from the wells\nOil and natural gas drilling and producing operations involve various risks.\nThe Company is subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including:\n\u2022\nwell blowouts, cratering, explosions and human related accidents\n\u2022\nmechanical, equipment and pipe failures\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, earthquakes and other natural disasters\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances and terrorist activities\n\u2022\noil, NGL and natural gas price reductions\n(11)\n\u2022\nenvironmental risks stemming from the use, production, handling and disposal of water, waste materials, hydrocarbons and other substances into the air, soil or water\n\u2022\ntitle problems\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing\n\u2022\nmarketing related infrastructure, transportation and processing limitations\n\u2022\nregulatory compliance issues\nAs a non-operator, we are dependent on third-party operators and the contractors they hire for operational safety, environmental safety and compliance with regulations of governmental authorities.\nThe Company maintains insurance against many potential losses or liabilities arising from well operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts believed by management to be prudent. However, this insurance does not protect the Company against all risks. For example, the Company does not maintain insurance for business interruption, acts of war or terrorism. Additionally, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. These risks could give rise to significant uninsured costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business condition and financial results.\nDebt level and interest rates may adversely affect our business.\nThe Company has a credit facility with a group of banks headed by Bank of Oklahoma (BOK) which consists of a revolving loan of $200,000,000. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a balance of $44,500,000 drawn on the facility. The facility has a current borrowing base of $80,000,000, which is secured by certain of the Company\u2019s properties and contains certain restrictive covenants.\nShould the Company incur additional indebtedness under its credit facility to fund capital projects or for other reasons, there is risk of it adversely affecting our business operations as follows:\n\u2022\ncash flows from operating activities required to service indebtedness may not be available for other purposes\n\u2022\ncovenants contained in the Company\u2019s borrowing agreement may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, pay dividends and make certain investments\n\u2022\nany limitation on the borrowing of additional funds may affect our ability to fund capital projects and may also affect how we will be able to react to economic and industry changes\n(12)\n\u2022\na significant increase in the interest rate on our credit facility will limit funds available for other purposes\n\u2022\nchanges in prevailing interest rates may affect the Company\u2019s capability to meet its interest payments, as its credit facility bears interest at floating rates\nThe borrowing base of our corporate revolving bank credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination and is based in part on oil, NGL and natural gas prices. A lowering of our borrowing base because of lower oil, NGL or natural gas prices, or for other reasons, could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the newly established borrowing base, or we might need to further secure the debt with additional collateral. Our ability to meet any debt obligations depends on our future performance. General business, economic, financial and product pricing conditions, along with other factors, affect our future performance, and many of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants relating to our credit facility could result in a default, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture legislative or regulatory changes may result in increased costs and decreased revenues, cash flows and liquidity.\nCompanies that operate wells in which Panhandle owns a working interest are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Panhandle, as a working interest owner, is therefore indirectly subject to these same regulations. New or changed laws and regulations such as those described below could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFederal Income Taxation\nProposals to repeal the expensing of intangible drilling costs, repeal the percentage depletion allowance and increase the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses, if enacted, would increase and accelerate the Company\u2019s payment of federal income taxes. As a result, these changes would decrease the Company\u2019s cash flows available for developing its oil and natural gas properties.\nHydraulic Fracturing and Water Disposal\nThe vast majority of oil and natural gas wells drilled in recent years have been, and future wells are expected to be, hydraulically fractured as a part of the process of completing the wells and putting them on production. This is true of the wells drilled in which the Company owns an interest. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that involves pumping water, sand and additives at high pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. In developing plays where hydraulic fracturing, which requires large volumes of water, is necessary for successful development, the demand for water may exceed the supply. A lack of readily available water or a significant increase in the cost of water could cause delays or increased completion costs.\nIn addition to water, hydraulic fracturing fluid contains chemical additives designed to optimize production. Well operators are being required in certain states to disclose the components of these additives. Additional states and the federal government\n(13)\nmay follow with similar requirements or may restrict the use of certain additives. This could result in more costly or less effective development of wells.\nOnce a well has been hydraulically fractured, the fluid produced from the fractured wells must be either treated for reuse or disposed of by injecting the fluid into disposal wells. Injection well disposal processes have been, and continue to be, studied to determine the extent of correlation between injection well disposal and the occurrence of earthquakes. Certain studies have concluded there is a correlation, and this has resulted in the cessation of or the reduction of injection rates in certain water disposal wells, especially in northern Oklahoma.\nEfforts to regulate hydraulic fracturing and fluid disposal continue at the local, state and federal level. New regulations are being considered, including limiting water withdrawals and usage, limiting water disposition, restricting which additives may be used, implementing state-wide hydraulic fracturing moratoriums and temporary or permanent bans in certain environmentally sensitive areas. Public sentiment against hydraulic fracturing and fluid disposal and shale production could result in more stringent permitting and compliance requirements. Consequences of these actions could potentially increase capital, compliance and operating costs significantly, as well as delay or halt the further development of oil and gas reserves on the Company\u2019s properties.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nClimate Change\nCertain studies have suggested that emission of certain gases, commonly referred to as \"greenhouse gases,\" may be impacting the earth's climate. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning oil and natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases. Various state governments and regional organizations are considering enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases from stationary sources such as oil and gas production equipment and operations. At the federal level, the EPA has already made findings and issued regulations that require operators to establish and report an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals for restricting greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the sale of oil and natural gas. The potential increase in our operating costs could include new or increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain equipment and facilities, install new emission controls on equipment and facilities, acquire allowances to authorize greenhouse gas emissions and pay taxes related to greenhouse gas emissions. Even without federal legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, states may pursue the issue either directly or indirectly. In addition, the United States was involved in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement will require countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their\n(14)\nintended nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years, beginning in 2020. If adopted, the Paris Agreement could further drive regulation in the United States. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states, or at a federal level, could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nShortages of oilfield equipment, services, qualified personnel and resulting cost increases could adversely affect results of operations.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil, NGL and natural gas prices, resulting in periodic shortages. When demand for rigs and equipment increases due to an increase in the number of wells being drilled, there have been shortages of drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel and other oilfield equipment. Higher oil, NGL and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand for, and result in increased prices of, drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. These shortages or price increases could negatively affect the ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations by the operators of the Company\u2019s wells, resulting in an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, cash flow and operating results.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and most of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nWe compete in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas acquisition, development, exploration and production. We face intense competition from both major and independent oil and natural gas companies to acquire desirable producing properties, new properties for future exploration and human resource expertise necessary to effectively develop properties. We also face similar competition in obtaining sufficient capital to maintain drilling rights in all drilling units.\nA substantial number of our competitors have financial and other resources significantly greater than ours, and some of them are fully integrated oil and natural gas companies. These companies are able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and are able to define, evaluate, bid for, purchase and subsequently drill a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit, potentially reducing our ability to participate in drilling on certain of our acreage as a working interest owner. Our ability to develop and exploit our oil and natural gas properties and to acquire additional quality properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully evaluate, select and acquire suitable properties and join in drilling with reputable operators in this highly competitive environment.\n(15)\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves and conduct our business.\nThe Company funds exploration, development and production activities primarily through cash flows from operations and acquisitions through borrowings under its credit facility. The timing and amount of capital necessary to carry out these activities can vary significantly as a result of product price fluctuations, property acquisitions, drilling results and the availability of drilling rigs, equipment, well services and transportation capacity.\nCash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including the Company\u2019s:\n\u2022\namount of proved reserves\n\u2022\nvolume of oil, NGL and natural gas produced\n\u2022\nreceived prices for oil, NGL and natural gas sold\n\u2022\nability to acquire and produce new reserves\n\u2022\nability to obtain financing\nWe may have limited ability to obtain the capital required to sustain our operations at current levels if our borrowing base under our credit facility is lowered as a result of decreased revenues, lower product prices, declines in reserves or for other reasons. Failure to sustain operations at current levels could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, cyber-attacks or other breaches in data security.\nPower, telecommunication or other system failures due to hardware or software malfunctions, computer viruses, vandalism, terrorism, natural disasters, fire, human error or by other means could significantly affect the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its business. Though we have implemented complex network security measures, stringent internal controls and maintain offsite backup of all crucial electronic data, there cannot be absolute assurance that a form of system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations results.", "PERMNO": 77236, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PHX"}
