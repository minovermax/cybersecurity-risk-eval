{"cik": "1285224", "company": "WILSHIRE BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Report. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risks.\nIf a significant number of clients fail to perform under their loans, our business, profitability, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nAs a lender, one of the largest risks we face is the possibility that a significant number of our client borrowers will fail to pay their loans when due. If borrower defaults cause losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses, it could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability, and financial condition. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Although this evaluation process uses historical, qualitative, and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses are dependent to a great extent on our experience and judgment. Although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is at a level adequate to absorb any inherent losses in our loan portfolio, we may find it necessary to further increase the allowance for loan losses or our regulators may require us to increase this allowance. If we are unable to effectively measure and limit the risk of default associated with our loan portfolio, our business, financial condition, and profitability may be adversely impacted.\nIncreases in the level of non-performing loans could adversely affect our business, profitability, and financial condition.\nIncreases in non-performing loans could have an adverse effect on our earnings as a result of related increases in our provisions for loan losses, charge-offs, and other losses related to non-performing loans which could in turn deplete our capital, leaving the Company undercapitalized. Non-performing loans at the year ended December 31, 2015 were $21.7 million, compared to $37.3 million at the end of 2014, and $37.2 million at the end of 2013.\nIncreases in our allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLike all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. Our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. However, actual loan losses could increase significantly as the result of changes in economic, operating, and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which are generally beyond our control. In addition, actual loan losses could increase significantly as a result of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. Thus, such losses could exceed our current allowance estimates. Either of these occurrences could materially affect our earnings adversely.\nIn addition, the measure of our allowance for loan losses is dependent on the adoption of new accounting standards. The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently issued a proposed Accounting Standards Update that presents a new credit impairment model, the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model, which would require financial institutions to estimate and develop a provision for credit losses at origination for the lifetime of the loan, as opposed to reserving for probable incurred losses up to the balance sheet date. Under the CECL model, credit deterioration would be reflected in the income statement in the period of origination or acquisition of the loan, with changes in expected credit losses due to further credit deterioration or improvement reflected in the periods in which the expectation changes. Accordingly, the CECL model could require financial institutions like the Bank to increase their allowances for loan losses. Moreover, the CECL model likely would create more volatility in our level of allowance for loan losses.\nFinally, the FDIC and the DBO, as an integral part of their respective supervisory functions, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such regulatory agencies may require us to increase our provision for losses on loans and loan commitments or to recognize further loan charge-offs, based upon judgments different from those of management. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBanking organizations are subject to interest rate risk and changes in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.\nA major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates we receive on interest-earning assets, such as loans we extend to our clients and securities held in our investment portfolio. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans, and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations.\nThe federal funds rate and other short-term market interest rates previously decreased substantially, which led to a \"steepening\" of the market yield curve with short-term rates considerably lower than long-term notes. However, with the recent increase in the federal funds rate by the Federal Open Market Committee, the yield curve has flattened out, but rates are changing on daily basis. We may not be able to minimize our interest rate risk. In addition, an increase in the general level of interest rates may hinder the ability of certain borrowers with variable rate loans to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations, leading to an increase in loan defaults. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, net interest margin, and our overall profitability.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations, meet our obligations as they become due, and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory actions against us. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Although management has implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions, any substantial, unexpected, and/or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe profitability of Wilshire Bancorp is dependent on the profitability of the Bank.\nBecause Wilshire Bancorp's principal activity is to act as the holding company of the Bank, the profitability of Wilshire Bancorp is largely dependent on the profitability of the Bank. The Bank operates in an extremely competitive banking environment, competing with a number of banks and other financial institutions which possess greater financial resources than those available to the Bank, in addition to other independent banks. In addition, the banking business is affected by general economic and political conditions, both domestic and international, and by government monetary and fiscal policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, high interest rates, short money supply, scarce natural resources, natural disasters, international terrorism, and other factors beyond the control of the Bank may adversely affect its profitability. Banks are also subject to extensive governmental supervision, regulation, and control, and future legislation and government policy could adversely affect the banking industry and the operations of the Bank.\nWilshire Bancorp relies heavily on the payment of dividends from the Bank.\nThe Bank is the only source of significant income for Wilshire Bancorp. Accordingly, the ability of Wilshire Bancorp to meet its debt service requirements and to pay dividends depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to it. However, the Bank is subject to regulations limiting the amount of dividends that it may pay to Wilshire Bancorp. For example, any payment of dividends by the Bank is subject to the FDIC's capital adequacy guidelines. All banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8.00%, Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets of 6.00%, Tier 1 common equity capital to total risk-weighted assets of 4.50%, and a ratio of Tier 1 capital to average adjusted assets of 4.00%. If (i) the FDIC increases any of these required ratios; (ii) the total of risk-weighted assets of the Bank increases significantly; and/or (iii) the Bank's income decreases significantly, the Bank's Board of Directors may decide or be required to retain a greater portion of the Bank's earnings to achieve and maintain the required capital or asset ratios. This will reduce the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends by the Bank to Wilshire Bancorp. Further, in some cases, the FDIC could take the position that it has the power to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends if, in its view, such payments would constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. Whether dividends are paid, payment frequency, and amount paid will also depend on the financial condition and performance of the Bank, and the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Bank. The foregoing restrictions on dividends paid by the Bank may limit Wilshire Bancorp's ability to obtain funds from such\ndividends for its cash needs, including funds for payment of its debt service requirements, operating expenses, and for payment of cash dividends to Wilshire Bancorp's shareholders. The amount of dividends the Bank could pay to Wilshire Bancorp as of December 31, 2015 without prior regulatory approval, which is limited by statute to the sum of undivided profits for the current year plus net profits for the preceding two years (less any distributions made to shareholders during such periods), was $21.3 million.\nTo continue our growth, we are affected by our ability to identify and acquire other financial institutions.\nWe intend to continue our current growth strategy. This strategy includes opening new branches and acquiring other banks that serve customers or markets we find desirable. The market for acquisitions remains highly competitive, and we may be unable to find satisfactory acquisition candidates in the future that fit our acquisition and growth strategy. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition candidates, an important component of our growth strategy may be lost. Additionally, our completed acquisitions, or any future acquisitions, may not produce the revenue, earnings, or synergies that we anticipated.\nIncome that we recognized and continue to recognize in connection with our 2013 acquisitions of BankAsiana and Saehan may be non-recurring or finite in duration.\nMirae Bank was acquired in 2009 and its loan portfolio was acquired at a discount of $54.9 million. Subsequently in 2013, we acquired BankAsiana and Saehan and their loan portfolio at a discount of $9.2 million and $27.7 million, respectively. This discount is amortized and accreted to interest income on a monthly basis. However, as these loans are paid-off, charged-off, sold, or transferred to non-accrual status, the income from the discount accretion is reduced. As the acquired loans are removed from our books, the related discount will no longer be available for accretion into interest income. Accretion of $8.0 million, $11.2 million, and $2.5 million on loans acquired at a discount was recorded as interest income during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the carrying balance of the discount on former Mirae loans was $921,000, down $413,000 from its value of $1.3 million as of December 31, 2014. The carrying value of the discount on former BankAsiana and Saehan loans was $2.0 million and $11.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015, and $3.7 million and $17.0 million, respectively at December 31, 2014. We expect the continued reduction of discount accretion recorded as interest income in future quarters.\nOur use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property collateral.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and an error in fact or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of an appraisal. Events occurring after the initial appraisal may also cause the value of the real estate to decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the value of collateral backing a loan may be less than supposed, and if a default occurs, we may not be able recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nWe are subject to environmental risks associated with owning real estate or collateral.\nThe cost of cleaning up or paying damages and penalties associated with environmental problems could increase our operating expenses. When a borrower defaults on a loan secured by real property, the Bank may acquire the property in foreclosure or accept a deed to the property surrendered by the borrower. We may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans. We may also own and lease premises where branches and other facilities are located. While we will have lending, foreclosure, and facilities guidelines intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable\nrisk of contamination, hazardous substances could exist on some of the properties that the Bank may own, manage, or occupy. We face the risk that environmental laws could force us to clean up the properties at the Company's expense. Potentially, it may cost much more to clean a property than the property is worth. We could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower's operations if the Bank takes a role in managing those operations after a default. The Bank may also find it difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties.\nAdverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions, especially in California, could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, and profitability.\nIf economic conditions worsen in the domestic or global economy, especially in California, our business, growth and profitability is likely to be materially adversely affected. A substantial number of our clients are geographically concentrated in California, and adverse economic conditions in California, particularly in the Los Angeles area, could harm the businesses of a disproportionate number of our clients. To the extent that our clients' underlying businesses are harmed, they are more likely to default on their loans. The conditions in the California economy and in the economies of other areas where we operate may deteriorate further in the future and such deterioration may adversely affect us.\nDifficult economic and market conditions may continue to adversely affect Wilshire's industry and business.\nWilshire is operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, including generally uncertain global, national, and local conditions. The significant economic contraction of 2007 to 2009 adversely affected business activity across a wide range of industries and regions. Businesses and consumers were negatively impacted and capital and credit markets experienced volatility and disruption. Economic conditions affect the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and affect the value of collateral securing loans. The economic contraction and related declines in real estate values caused an elevated level of impaired loans and an associated increase in loan loss provision and charge-offs, leading to net losses for the Company in 2010 and 2011.\nWilshire's business is closely tied to the economies of its primary markets in general and is particularly affected by the economies of Southern California, Texas, New Jersey, and the New York metropolitan area. The economies of California and the East Coast have generally stabilized and/or are recovering. The housing market has improved with prices increasing in 2014. Vacancy rates for commercial properties have stabilized and small business owners are increasingly considering bank borrowings in order to grow. However, slow economic growth and the lingering effect of the 2007 to 2009 downturn continue to make for challenging operating conditions which may continue for some time and may have an adverse impact on Wilshire.\nThe banking industry and Wilshire operate under certain regulatory requirements that may change significantly and in a manner that further impairs revenues, operating income and financial condition.\nWilshire operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by the DBO, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Board. The regulations affect Wilshire's investment practices, lending activities and dividend policy, among other things. Moreover, federal and state banking laws and regulations undergo frequent and often significant changes and have been subject to significant change in recent years, sometimes retroactively applied, and may change significantly in the future. Changes to these laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies could, among other things, make regulatory compliance more difficult or expensive for Wilshire, limit the products Wilshire can offer or increase the ability of non-banks to compete and could adversely affect Wilshire in significant but unpredictable ways, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Wilshire's financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector. Included in the Dodd-Frank Act are, for example, changes related to deposit insurance assessments, executive compensation and corporate governance requirements, payment of interest on demand deposits, interchange fees, and overdraft services. The Dodd-Frank Act also implemented the \"Volcker Rule\" for banks and bank holding companies, which would prohibit proprietary trading, investment in and sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds, and otherwise limit the relationships with such funds. See the section entitled \"Supervision and Regulation-The Dodd-Frank Act\" for more information. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking by various regulatory agencies and will take effect over several years, making it difficult at this time to anticipate the overall financial impact of this expansive legislation on Wilshire, its customers or the financial industry generally. Likewise, any new consumer financial protection laws enacted by the CFPB, which was established pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, would apply to all banks and thrifts, and may increase Wilshire's compliance and operational costs in the future.\nIn addition, the banking regulatory agencies adopted a final rule in July 2013 that implements the Basel III changes to the international regulatory capital framework and revises the U.S. risk-based and leverage capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations to strengthen identified areas of weakness in the capital rules and to address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Rules, effective January 1, 2015, impose a stricter regulatory capital framework that requires banking organizations to hold more and higher-quality levels of capital to act as a financial cushion to absorb losses and help banking organizations better withstand periods of financial stress. See the risk factor entitled \"Wilshire may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements which would adversely affect Wilshire's net income and future growth\" for more information.\nWe cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation. Our compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and may restrict certain activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, interest rates charged on loans, interest rates paid on deposits, access to capital and brokered deposits and locations of banking offices. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in fines, penalties, sanctions, and damage to our reputation which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe CFPB may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices, which may directly impact the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of the \"Federal consumer financial laws, and to prevent evasions thereof,\" with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are \"unfair, deceptive, or abusive\" in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service (\"UDAP authority\"). The potential reach of the CFPB's broad rulemaking powers and UDAP authority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank is currently unknown.\nThe Bank is subject to federal and state and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB, and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under\nfair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to the Bank's performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact the Bank's rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact the Bank's reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions and new branches.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and other illegal conduct and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts and monitor the activity through such accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity, and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact the Bank's reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide key components of its business infrastructure.\nMany key components of our operations, including data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online interfaces and services, internet connections, and network access are provided by other companies. Our vendor management process selects third-party vendors carefully, but we do not control their actions. Problems, including disruptions in communication, security breaches, or failure of a vendor to provide services, could hurt our operations or our relationships with customers. If our vendors suffer financial or operational issues, our operations and reputation could suffer from a failure by the vendor in its ability to serve us and our customers. Third-party vendors are also a source of operational and information security risk to us. Vendors' market power significantly limits our ability to be indemnified for a vendor's negligence. In addition, insurance does not adequately cover all such exposure. Replacing or renegotiating contracts with vendors could entail significant operational expense and delays. The use of third-party vendors represents an unavoidable inherent risk to our company.\nWe may be subject to potential liability and business risk from actions by our regulators related to supervision of third parties.\nOversight management by us of third parties by which we acquire deposit accounts and offer products and services, may be required to be expanded by our auditors or regulators. Although we have added significant compliance staff and have used outside consultants, our internal and external compliance examiners must be satisfied with the results of such augmentation and enhancement. We cannot assure you that we will satisfy all related requirements. Not achieving a compliance management system which is deemed adequate could result a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact the Bank's reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ongoing review and analysis of our compliance management systems and implementation of any changes resulting from that review and analysis will likely result in increased non-interest expense.\nOur operations may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available or may not be on terms acceptable to us when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. While we believe our existing capital resources at the Bank are sufficient to satisfy the Bank's capital requirements for the foreseeable future and will be sufficient to offset any problem assets. However, should our asset quality erode and require significant additional provision, resulting in consistent net operating losses at the Bank, our capital levels will decline and we will need to raise capital to support the Bank. In addition, we are subject to separate capital requirements and needs at the holding company. While we are in compliance with capital requirements at the holding company, there may be reasons in the future why we would determine to increase our capital levels at the holding company. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to operate in substantially the same manner as we have before, including the payment of dividends at the bank and holding company level, could be materially impaired.\nOur financial condition, earnings, and asset quality could be adversely affected if our consumer facing operations do not operate in compliance with applicable regulations.\nWhile all aspects of our operations are subject to detailed and complex compliance regimes, bank regulators have increased their focus on risk management and consumer compliance, and we expect this focus to continue. As a result, those portions of our lending operations which most directly deal with consumers, in particular our mortgage operations, credit card and other consumer lending business, pose particular challenges. While we are not aware of any material issues with our compliance, mortgage and other consumer lending raises significant compliance risks resulting from the detailed and complex nature of mortgage and consumer lending regulations imposed by federal regulatory agencies, and the relatively independent operating environment in which loan officers operate. As a result, despite the education, compliance training, supervision and oversight we exercise in these areas, failure to comply with these regulations could result in the Bank being strictly liable for restitution or damages to individual borrowers, and to a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact the Bank's reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our mortgage business acquisition depends upon our ability to maintain the operations, integrate and manage the risks of this business, and to successfully market, originate and sell mortgage loans. If we are unable to do so, the profitability of our mortgage business may be adversely affected.\nThe long-term success of our mortgage business depends upon our ability to market, originate, fund, and sell our mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan origination volume will be largely dependent on our ability to offer competitively priced, desirable loan products under the Wilshire brand and our ability to attract qualified prospective borrowers. In addition, we employ various economic hedging strategies in an attempt to mitigate the interest rate risk and other risks inherent in a mortgage loan commitment. Our hedging activities include entering into derivative instruments. Poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions could fail to mitigate our risks and losses, or even increase our risks and losses beyond what they would have been had we not used such hedging strategies.\nWe may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements which would adversely affect our net income and future growth.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, and on July 9, 2013, the FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of Currency, adopted the Basel III Rules, which establish a stricter regulatory capital framework that requires banking organizations to hold more and higher-quality capital. The Basel III Rules increased capital ratios for all banking organizations and introduced a \"capital conservation buffer\" which is in addition to each capital ratio. If a banking organization dips into its capital conservation buffer, it may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends and discretionary bonus payments to its executive officers. The Basel III Rules assign a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The Basel III Rules also require unrealized gains and losses on certain \"available-for-sale\" securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out option is exercised. Basel III includes changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, some of which are subject to a two-year transition period. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets, and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock will be required to be deducted from capital, subject to a two-year transition period. Finally, Tier 1 capital will include accumulated other comprehensive income (which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities), subject to a two-year transition period. We elected to take the one-time option in the first quarter of 2015 to permanently opt out of the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in our capital calculation in order to reduce the impact of market volatility on its regulatory capital levels.\nThe Basel III Rules became effective for the company on January 1, 2015. Our failure to comply with the minimum capital requirements could result in our regulators taking formal or informal actions against the Company which could restrict our future growth or operations.\nMaintaining or increasing our market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer demand. There is increasing pressure on financial services companies to provide products and services at lower prices. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet-based services, could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products or services. A failure to achieve market acceptance of any new products we introduce, or a failure to introduce products that the market may demand, could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability, or growth prospects.\nSignificant reliance on loans secured by real estate may increase our vulnerability to downturns in the California real estate market and other variables impacting the value of real estate.\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 78.9% of our loans were secured by real estate, a substantial portion of which consist of loans secured by real estate in California. Conditions in the California real estate market historically have influenced the level of our non-performing assets. A real estate recession in Southern California could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, California has experienced, on occasion, significant natural disasters, including drought, earthquakes, brush fires and flooding attributed to various weather phenomenon. In addition to these catastrophes, California has experienced a moderate decline in housing prices beginning in late 2006. The decline in housing prices subsequently developed into a financial crisis, characterized by the further decline in the real estate market in many parts of the country, including California, starting in the second half of 2007, and the failures of many financial institutions between 2008 and 2011. The availability of insurance to compensate for losses\nresulting from such crises is limited. The occurrence of one or more of such crises could impair the value of the collateral for our real estate secured loans and adversely affect us.\nIf we fail to retain our key employees, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur future success depends in large part upon the continuing contributions of our key management personnel. If we lose the services of one or more key employees within a short period of time, we could be adversely affected. Our future success is also dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for such employees among financial institutions in California is intense. Our inability to attract and retain additional key personnel could adversely affect us.\nWe rely heavily on technology and computer systems, and computer failure could result in loss of business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdvances and changes in technology could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. We face many challenges, including the increased demand for providing customers access to their accounts and the systems to perform banking transactions electronically. Our ability to compete depends on its ability to continue to adapt technology on a timely and cost-effective basis to meet these demands. In addition, our business and operations are susceptible to negative effects from computer system failures, communication and energy disruption, and unethical individuals with the technological ability to cause disruptions or failures of its data processing systems.\nRisks associated with our Internet-based systems and online commerce security, including \"hacking\" and \"identify theft,\" could adversely affect our business.\nWe have a website and conduct a portion of our business over the Internet. We rely heavily upon data processing, including loan servicing and deposit processing software, communications systems, and information systems from a number of third parties to conduct our business. Third party, or internal, systems and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled due to deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Our operations are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, spam attacks, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access and other unforeseen events. Undiscovered data corruption could render our customer information inaccurate. These events may obstruct our ability to provide services and process transactions. While we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable privacy and data security laws, an incident could put our confidential information about our customers at risk.\nAlthough we have not experienced a cyber-incident that has been successful in compromising our data or systems, we can never be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to breaches of security or other technological difficulties or failures. The Company monitors and modifies, as necessary, its protective measures in response to the perpetual evolution of cyber threats.\nA breach in the security of any of the Company information systems, or other cyber incident, could have an adverse impact on, among other things, the Company's revenue, ability to attract and maintain customers, and business reputation. In addition, as a result of any breach, we could incur higher costs to conduct our business, to increase protection, or related to remediation.\nFurthermore, our customers could incorrectly blame the Company and terminate their accounts with the Company for a cyber-incident which occurred on their own system or with that of an unrelated third party. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nIn response to the Executive Order released by the Obama Administration, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, referred to as the Executive Order, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council developed a cybersecurity assessment tool to help institutions identify their risks and determine their cybersecurity preparedness. The FFIEC has also published cybersecurity guidance on its website, along with observations from recent cybersecurity assessments. The federal banking agencies have indicated that they will use the assessment tool as guidance during a financial institution's safety and soundness examination. Although we have used the assessment tool to develop policies and procedures related to our cybersecurity, no assurance can be given that the regulators will believe that our information security systems are adequate or that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing cyber threats and attacks.\nWe continually encounter technological changes which could result in the Company having fewer resources than many of its competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements.\nFrequent introductions of new technologically-driven products and services in the financial services industry result in the need for rapid technological change. In addition, the effective use of technology may result in improved customer service and reduced costs. Our future success depends, to a certain extent, on our ability to identify the needs of customers and address those needs by using technology to provide the desired products and services and to create additional efficiencies in operations. Certain competitors may have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to successfully implement new technology-driven products and services or effectively market these products and services to our customers. Failure to implement the necessary technological changes could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe market for our common stock is limited, and potentially subject to volatile changes in price.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuation in response to numerous factors, including variations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors, changes by financial research analysts in their evaluation of our financial results or those of our competitors, or our failure or that of our competitors to meet such estimates, conditions in the economy in general or the banking industry in particular, or unfavorable publicity affecting us or the banking industry. In addition, the equity markets have, on occasion, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies' securities and have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. In addition, the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder's holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Further, the issuance or registration by us of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the effect of increasing the number of outstanding shares or, in the case of registrations, the number of shares of our common stock that are freely tradable; any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly. Any such fluctuations may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock.\nWe may experience impairment of goodwill.\nThe Company recognized goodwill in connection with the acquisitions of Liberty Bank of New York, BankAsiana, and Saehan. Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment at least annually, rather than amortized. In addition, the Company tests on an interim basis for triggering events that would indicate impairment. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test. However, under ASU 2011-08, a company can first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Therefore it would not be required to calculate the fair value unless we determined, based on a qualitative assessment, that it was more-likely-than-not that its fair value was less than its carrying amount. If management's assumptions\nused to evaluate goodwill are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment may not be recognized in a timely manner. Goodwill may be written down in future periods.\nWe face substantial competition in our primary market area.\nWe conduct our banking operations primarily in Southern California. Increased competition in our market may result in reduced loans and deposits. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer the same banking services that we offer in our service area. These competitors include national banks, regional banks, and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including without limitation, savings and loan institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain deposits, and range and quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. We also face competition from out-of-state financial intermediaries that have opened low-end production offices or that solicit deposits in our market areas. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue our loan growth and level of deposits and our results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be adversely affected.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our charter documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management.\nCertain provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could discourage unsolicited takeover proposals not approved by the Board of Directors in which shareholders could receive a premium for their shares, thereby potentially limiting the opportunity for our shareholders to dispose of their shares at the higher price generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal or may have the effect of permitting our current management, including the current Board of Directors, to retain its position, and place it in a better position to resist changes that shareholders may wish to make if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our business. The anti-takeover measures included in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, include, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022 the elimination of cumulative voting,\n\u2022 the adoption of a classified Board of Directors,\n\u2022 super-majority shareholder voting requirements to modify certain provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and\n\u2022 restrictions on certain \"business combinations\" with third parties who may acquire our securities outside of an action taken by us.\nWe could be negatively impacted by downturns in the South Korean economy.\nMany of our customers are locally based Korean-Americans who also conduct business in South Korea. Although we conduct most of our business with locally-based customers and rely on domestically located assets to collateralize our loans and credit arrangements, we have historically had some exposure\nto the economy of South Korea in connection with certain portions of our loans and credit transactions with Korean banks. Such exposure has consisted of:\n\u2022 discounts of acceptances created by banks in South Korea,\n\u2022 advances made against clean documents presented under sight letters of credit issued by banks in South Korea,\n\u2022 advances made against clean documents held for later presentation under letters of credit issued by banks in South Korea, and\n\u2022 extensions of credit to borrowers in the U.S. secured by letters of credit issued by banks in South Korea.\nWe generally enter into any such loan or credit arrangements, in excess of $200,000 and of longer than 120 days, only with the largest of the Korean banks and spread other lesser or shorter term loan or credit arrangements among a variety of medium-sized Korean banks.\nManagement closely monitors our exposure to the South Korean economy and the activities of Korean banks with which we conduct business. To date, we have not experienced any significant loss attributable to our exposure to South Korea. Nevertheless, our efforts to minimize exposure to downturns in the South Korean economy may not be successful in the future, and another significant downturn in the South Korean economy could possibly result in significant credit losses for us.\nIn addition, due to our customer base being largely made up of Korean-Americans, our deposit base could significantly decrease as a result of deterioration in the Korean economy. For example, some of our customers' businesses may rely on funds from South Korea. Further, our customers may temporarily withdraw deposits in order to transfer funds and benefit from gains on foreign exchange and interest rates, and/or to support their relatives in South Korea during downturns in the Korean economy. A significant decrease in our deposits could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional shares of our common stock issued in the future could have a dilutive effect.\nShares of our common stock eligible for future issuance and sale could have a dilutive effect on the market for our stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of common stock. As of February 12, 2016, there were approximately 78,643,353 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, 858,525 shares of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock have been granted and are reserved for issuance under the Wilshire Bancorp, Inc. 2008 Stock Option Plan, or the \"2008 Stock Option Plan\". Thus, approximately 120,368,279 shares of our common stock remain authorized, not reserved for stock options, and available for future issuance and sale at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nChanges in accounting standards may affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes and their impacts on us can be hard to predict and may result in unexpected and materially adverse impacts on our reported financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business reputation is important and any damage to it may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur reputation is very important for our business, as we rely on our relationships with our current, former, and potential clients and stockholders, and in the communities we serve. Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and exchange listing requirements, negative publicity, our conduct of our business or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWeakness in commodity businesses could adversely affect our performance.\nIn addition to the geographic concentration of our markets, certain industry-specific economic factors also affect us. For example, while we do not have a concentration in energy lending, the industry is cyclical and recently has experienced a significant drop in crude oil prices. A severe and prolonged decline in oil and gas commodity prices would adversely affect that industry and, consequently, may adversely affect our customers who are interdependent with that industry.\nThe pendency of the proposed merger with BBCN and the related diversion of our management's attention from the operation of our business may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 7, 2015, we entered into a merger agreement with BBCN which, subject to shareholder approval and various other conditions, would result in Wilshire Bancorp being acquired by BBCN. Our management and Board of Directors have devoted and will continue to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the proposed merger. In addition, in connection with the proposed merger, we have incurred and will continue to incur expenses, which could prove to be significant. Our business and our operating and financial results may be materially adversely affected by the diversion of management's time and attention and the expenses incurred in connection with the proposed merger.\nIf the proposed merger is not completed and we are not otherwise acquired, we may consider other strategic alternatives which are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nIf the proposed merger is not completed, our Board of Directors will review and consider various alternatives available to us, including, among others, continuing as a public company with no material changes to our business or capital structure. These alternative transactions or initiatives may involve various additional risks to our business, including, among others, distraction of our management team and associated expenses as described above in connection with the proposed merger. In addition, our ability to consummate any alternative transaction or execute any alternative initiative could be subject to various uncertainties. All of the foregoing could adversely affect our operations or financial condition\nThe failure to complete the merger with BBCN could negatively impact our business.\nThere is no assurance that the merger with BBCN or any other transaction will occur or that the conditions to the merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. Further, there is no assurance that any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement with BBCN will not occur. If the proposed merger or a similar transaction is not completed, the share price of our common stock may drop to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that a transaction will be completed. In addition, under circumstances defined in the merger agreement with BBCN, we may be required to pay a termination fee of up to approximately $40.0 million. Certain costs associated with the merger are already incurred or may be payable even if the merger is not completed. Further, a failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. There can be no assurance that our business, these relationships, or our\nfinancial condition will not be negatively impacted, as compared to the condition prior to the announcement of the merger, if the merger is not consummated.", "PERMNO": 86440, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WIBC"}
