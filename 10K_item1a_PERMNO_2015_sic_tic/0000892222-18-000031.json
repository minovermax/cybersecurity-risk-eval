{"cik": "892222", "company": "CRAFT BREW ALLIANCE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIf we are unable to gauge trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, our sales and market share may decrease and our gross margin may be adversely affected.\nThe costs and management attention involved in maintaining an innovative brand portfolio have been, and are expected to continue to be, significant. If we have not gauged consumer preferences correctly, or are unable to maintain consistently high quality beers as we develop new brands, our overall brand image may be damaged. If this were to occur, our future sales, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected. Also, increased costs associated with developing new products may have a negative effect on our gross margin.\nIncreased competition could adversely affect sales and results of operations.\nWe compete in the highly competitive craft beer market, as well as in the much larger specialty beer category, which includes the imported beer segment and fuller-flavored beers offered by major brewers. We face increasing competition from producers of wine, spirits and flavored alcohol beverages offered by the larger brewers and spirit producers. We are also monitoring the impact of cannabis as more states legalize marijuana for retail sale. Increased competition could adversely affect our future sales and results of operations. See \"Competition\" in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely on computer information systems to conduct our business. We have policies and procedures in place to protect against and reduce the occurrence of failures, interruptions, or breaches of security of these systems. However, there can be no assurances that these policies and procedures will eliminate the occurrence of failures, interruptions or breaches of security or that they will adequately restore our systems or minimize any such events. The occurrence of a failure, interruption or breach of security of our computer information systems could result in loss of intellectual property, delays in our production, loss of critical information, or other events, any of which could harm our future sales or operating results.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our employees, or our customers,\nIndex\nincluding the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. Any such breach, loss, or disclosure could result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand image and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. In addition, our current data protection measures might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats, while the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nOur business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending.\nConsumer demand for luxury or perceived luxury goods, including craft beer, can be sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions, job losses and unemployment or underemployment, perceived or actual declines in disposable consumer income and wealth, and changes in consumer confidence in the economy, could significantly reduce customer demand for craft beer in general, and the products we offer specifically. Furthermore, our consumers may choose to replace our products with the fuller-flavored national brands or other more affordable, although lower quality, alternatives available in the market. Any such decline in consumption of our products would likely have a significant negative impact on our operating results.\nChanges in consumer preferences or public attitudes about alcohol could decrease demand for our products.\nIf consumers become unwilling to accept our products or if general consumer trends cause a decrease in the demand for beer, including craft beer, our sales and results of operations would be adversely affected. There is no assurance that the craft brewing segment will experience growth in future periods. If the markets for wine, spirits or flavored alcohol beverages continue to grow, this could draw consumers away from the beer industry in general and our products specifically. Further, the alcoholic beverage industry has become the subject of considerable societal and political attention in recent years due to increasing public concern over alcohol-related social problems, including drunk driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. In reaction to these concerns, steps may be taken to restrict advertising by beer producers, to impose additional cautionary labeling or packaging requirements, or to increase excise or other taxes on beer. Any such developments may have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) issued a proposed rule in November 2015 on the use of \u201cgluten-free\u201d labeling for fermented and hydrolyzed foods and beverages that may affect our ability to market our Omission Beer.\nCBA launched Omission beer in May 2012 as the first brand of craft beer to be brewed in the United States using conventional beer ingredients (including malted barley, a gluten-containing grain) and \u201ccrafted to remove gluten.\u201d Omission beers are brewed similarly to other craft beers except that, at the point of fermentation, a brewing enzyme called Brewers Clarex\u2122 is added which breaks apart the gluten protein chains. Samples from each batch are tested internally using the R5 Competitive ELISA method for gluten content before packaging. The beers are then packaged into bottles in a closed packaging environment to eliminate any chance of cross contamination. Packaged samples are also sent to an independent third party lab for testing before the lot is released from the brewery. We post all test results on our website for consumers to view before they decide to purchase the beer.\nOmission beers are subject to regulation by the Department of Treasury\u2019s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (\u201cTTB\u201d), but as a result of overlapping jurisdictions of the FDA and TTB, the role each agency plays in the regulation of fermented alcohol beverages, and the commitments the two agencies have made to work together to establish consistent gluten labeling policies for comparable alcohol beverage products, the above referenced FDA notice of proposed rulemaking has far-reaching implications for fermented alcohol beverages, like Omission Beer, that are subject to regulation by both the FDA and TTB. In accordance with the TTB\u2019s premarket approval requirements, the TTB approved Omission labeling, including its gluten-related claims, as per their policy concerning gluten content statements in the labeling and advertising of malt beverages.\nIf the FDA's proposed rule becomes final as written, the TTB\u2019s policy may be superseded, which would have a significant impact on our ability to market and sell our Omission beers as \u201ccrafted to remove gluten\u201d and negatively impact our operating results. The proposed rule is under review by the Office of Management and Budget and is now expected to become final in late 2018, although adoption may continue to be delayed under the current administration\u2019s executive order to reduce regulations.\nWe may identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, which, if not remediated, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for complex revenue transactions for the year ended December 31, 2016. As discussed in Item 9A, the material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2017. However, additional material weaknesses in our internal control environment may be identified in the future, which could result in material misstatements in our financial statement and a loss of investor confidence in the integrity of our financial reporting and other public disclosures, potentially\nIndex\ntriggering increased sales of our common stock and downward pressure on our stock price.\nProduct safety and quality concerns may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards which we expect our breweries and our brewing partners to meet. However, we cannot assure you that, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we will always meet these standards. If we, or our brewing partners, fail to comply with applicable product safety and quality standards and our products on the market are, or become, contaminated or adulterated, we may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause our reputation and business to suffer.\nWe have a continuing relationship with Anheuser-Busch, LLC and the current distribution network that would be difficult to replace.\nMost of our products are sold and distributed through A-B\u2019s distribution network. If the A-B Distributor Agreement were terminated, we would be faced with a number of operational tasks, including establishing and maintaining direct contracts with the existing wholesaler network or negotiating agreements with replacement wholesalers on an individual basis, and enhancing our credit evaluation, billing and accounts receivable processes. Such an undertaking would require significant effort and substantial time to complete, during which the distribution of our products could be impaired.\nWe are dependent on our wholesalers for the sale of our products.\nAlthough substantially all of our products are sold and distributed through A-B, we continue to rely heavily on wholesalers, many of which are independent, for the sale of our products to retailers. Independent wholesalers make their own business decisions that may not align with our interests and there is no assurance that the sales efforts of distributors will be effective in generating sales of our products.\nAny disruption in the ability of the wholesalers, A-B, or us to distribute products efficiently due to any significant operational problems, such as widespread labor union strikes or the loss of a major wholesaler as a customer, could hinder our ability to get our products to retailers and could have a material adverse impact on our sales, results of operations and cash flows. A-B has been purchasing distributors in states where it is legally permissible, which could impact our distribution if the A-B relationship were to end. During 2017, 35% of our shipments were through A-B owned distributors.\nOur investments in our sales and marketing infrastructure may negatively affect our financial results without increasing sales.\nWe intend to reinvest cost savings in selling, general and administrative expenses in our sales and marketing infrastructure, including increased spending to support our Kona brand. Also, beginning January 1, 2019, we will reinvest an additional $0.25 per case-equivalent in our sales and marketing efforts for our products. While we seek to design effective advertising and promotions to support our brands, these efforts may not lead to enhanced brand equity or higher sales in the long term.\nOur agreements with A-B may limit our ability to engage in certain activities and investments.\nThe Exchange Agreement requires us to obtain A-B's consent prior to undertaking certain activities and investments. For example, we must obtain A-B's consent before acquiring another brewer if the purchase price exceeds $30 million or purchasing a non-brewing entity if the purchase price exceeds $2 million. If A-B opposes strategic or financial investments proposed by our management, A-B may decline to give its consent to activities or investments that our management believes are in the best interest of our shareholders.\nA-B has an influential voice in decisions of the board of directors and shareholders.\nA-B owns 31.4% of our outstanding common stock, making A-B our largest shareholder. In addition, under the Exchange Agreement, A-B may designate two nominees to our board of directors. These directors also participate on our audit, compensation, and nominating and governance committees as non-voting observers, and one of these directors participates on our strategic planning committee as a voting member. As a result, A-B has an influential voice in deliberations of the board of directors and shareholders. A-B and its affiliates also have the right to terminate our contract brewing arrangements and to rescind certain amendments to our other contracts with them upon the occurrence of certain events. See \u201cRelationship with Anheuser-Busch, LLC\u201d in Item 1. Business above for additional information.\nExpansion of our Kona brewery may be subject to various risks, including cost overruns, construction delays, and inability to fully utilize additional production capacity, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring 2015, we held a ground-breaking ceremony on the site of a new, state-of-the-art brewing facility in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, with an annual production capacity of 100,000 barrels at a total estimated cost of approximately $20 million. As with all projects of this magnitude, there is the potential risk of significant cost overruns, which could require us to increase our borrowing under our revolving credit facility or to find additional financing. We may also experience unforeseen construction delays, which could result in our inability to bring the new Kona brewery into production as scheduled, adversely affecting our results of operations\nIndex\nand financial condition. In addition, if we do not achieve sufficient growth in product sales to absorb the increased production capacity, we may be unable to realize our goals for gross margin improvement, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and return on investment.\nWe expect to continue to make strategic investments in improvements aimed at increasing the efficiency, capabilities and capacity of our breweries, improving our ordering and logistics systems, and enhancing the customer experience at our brewpubs. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits and generate adequate returns on such capital improvement projects may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOperating breweries at production levels substantially below their current designed capacities could negatively impact our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the annual working capacity of our breweries was approximately 855,000 barrels. Due to many factors, including seasonality and production schedules of various draft products and bottled products and packages, actual production capacity will rarely, if ever, approach full working capacity. We believe that capacity utilization of the breweries will fluctuate throughout the year, and even though we expect that capacity of our breweries will be efficiently utilized during periods when our sales are strongest, there likely will be periods when the capacity utilization will be lower. If we experience contraction in our sales and brewing volumes, the resulting excess capacity and unabsorbed overhead will have an adverse effect on our gross margins, operating cash flows and overall financial performance. We periodically evaluate whether we expect to recover the costs of our production breweries over the course of their useful lives. If facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability will be performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to projected future undiscounted cash flows along with other quantitative and qualitative analyses. If we determine that the carrying value of such assets does not appear to be recoverable, we will recognize an impairment loss by a charge against current operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur sales are concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, California and Hawaii.\nOur sales in 2017 were concentrated in Washington, Oregon, California and Hawaii and, consequently, our future sales may be adversely affected by changes in economic and business conditions within these states. We also believe the Pacific Northwest and California are among the most competitive craft beer markets in the United States, both in terms of number of market participants and consumer awareness. The Pacific Northwest and California offer significant competition to our products, not only from other craft brewers, but also from the major domestic brewers, wine producers and flavored alcohol beverages.\nWe are dependent upon the continued service of our senior management and other key personnel.\nOur future success is dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly Andrew Thomas, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of our senior management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, the loss of Andrew Thomas as our Chief Executive Officer, and the failure to find a replacement satisfactory to A-B, would be a termination event under the A-B Distributor Agreement.\nWe also may be unable to retain existing management, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel critical to our success, which could result in harm to significant customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how, and unanticipated recruiting and training costs.\nOur gross margin may fluctuate.\nFuture gross margin may fluctuate and even decline as a result of many factors, including: product pricing levels; sales mix between draft and packaged product sales and within the various bottled product packages; level of fixed and semi-variable operating costs; level of production at our breweries in relation to current production capacity; availability and prices of raw materials, production inputs such as energy, and packaging materials; rates charged for freight; and federal and state excise taxes. The high percentage of fixed and semi-variable operating costs causes our gross margin to be particularly sensitive to relatively small changes in sales volume or price increases in the various components of our production and distribution.\nWe may be subject to litigation that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various types of litigation, including fair trade practice, product liability, and employment-related claims. Such litigation may be time consuming, distracting and costly, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See Note 17, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements found in Part II, Item 8 of this report, for additional information related to legal proceedings.\nOur ability to obtain key ingredients for our products, including hops and malt, is dependent on a number of factors, including competition from other brewers, weather, and the decisions of growers regarding which crops to grow.\nWe purchase most of our raw materials from U.S. brokers, many of which rely on foreign sources, particularly for malt. As a result, prices for these ingredients may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations. Also, as consumer preference for innovative\nIndex\ncraft beer products increases, the demand for new hop varietals has grown, and many breweries enter into multi-year contracts with growers. Adverse weather events may also reduce the supply of certain ingredients, many of which are grown in a limited number of geographic regions. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain certain of our ingredients in a timely fashion to meet consumer demand, and our gross margin may be adversely affected if we are required to pay higher prices to obtain needed ingredients that are in high demand. Such factors may also result in lower sales of our products, which would have a negative effect on our financial results.\nWe may experience higher packaging costs and shipping costs, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nMany of our packaging materials, particularly glass, are obtained from a single source. Although we believe alternative suppliers of packaging materials, including bottles, cans, carriers and labels, are available, a number of factors, including consolidation in the packaging industry and competition from other manufacturers in need of packaging materials, may result in supply shortages or higher prices, which could adversely affect our financial results. We have also seen recent increases in shipping costs for our products. While we are seeking to manage those costs through more efficient management of brewery operations and logistics, we may not be successful. We also may not be able to pass along increased costs through higher prices for our products, with a corresponding negative impact on our financial results.\nHigher health care costs may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are self-insured with respect to health care expenses for our employees. During 2015, we experienced higher than average medical expense claims, which increased our Selling, general and administrative expenses. If we experience higher costs in the future, our operating results may be negatively affected.\nA failure in any of our supply chain processes could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nOur results are highly dependent on our ability to accurately forecast and execute throughout the entire supply chain, including sales forecasting, raw material ordering, brewing and distribution. The combination of our recent growth and increased brand complexity has increased the operating complexity of our business. We cannot guarantee that we will effectively manage such complexity without experiencing planning failures, operating inefficiencies, or other issues that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe engage in electronic communications between third parties, including A-B and our wholesalers, as part of our supply chain processes. Any interruptions or errors in our electronic interfaces may negatively affect our operating activities.\nUnavailability of production at our brewing partner may adversely affect our capacity and disrupt our ability to satisfy demand for our products.\nIn 2016, we entered into a contract brewing agreement with ABCS and, once fully optimized, anticipate producing up to 300,000 barrels of our beer at this facility annually. If production at this facility should be disrupted due to unforeseen circumstances, our ability to produce and ship sufficient quantities of our beer to meet demand in certain key geographic markets, particularly Texas and the southeastern United States, could be significantly impaired, resulting in decreased sales and a negative impact on our wholesaler relationships in those markets.\nAn increase in excise taxes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. federal government currently levies an excise tax of $18 per barrel on beer sold for consumption in the United States. However, brewers, such as us, that produce less than two million barrels annually, are now taxed at $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels shipped, with the remainder of the shipments taxed at $16 per barrel, due to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. If the tax cut is not permanently extended, this new rate is scheduled to return to $7 per barrel for the first 60,000 barrels and $18 per barrel up to two million barrels annually in 2020. The individual states in which we operate also impose excise taxes on beer and other alcohol beverages in varying amounts. Federal and state legislators routinely consider various proposals to impose additional excise taxes on the production of alcoholic beverages, including beer. Any such increases in excise taxes, if enacted, would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to tax liabilities imposed by the jurisdictions where we operate.\nTax liabilities may vary significantly and are subject to change. Among others, these taxes include income taxes, property taxes, indirect taxes (excise, sales, use and gross receipts taxes), payroll taxes, and withholding taxes. We may not be able to pass these tax costs on to consumers and remain competitive. New tax laws and regulations and changes to existing tax laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nIndex\nWe are subject to governmental regulations affecting our breweries and brewpubs.\nOur business is highly regulated by federal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern all aspects of the production and distribution of beer, including permitting, licensing, trade practices, labeling, advertising and marketing, distributor relationships and various other matters. A variety of federal, state and local governmental authorities also levy various taxes, license fees and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Noncompliance with such laws and regulations may cause the TTB or any particular state or jurisdiction to revoke its license or permit, restricting our ability to conduct business, or result in the imposition of significant fines or penalties. One or more regulatory authorities could determine that we have not complied with applicable licensing or permitting regulations or have not maintained the approvals necessary for us to conduct business within our jurisdiction. If licenses, permits or approvals necessary for our brewery or pub operations were unavailable or unduly delayed, or if any permits or licenses that we hold were to be revoked, or additional permits or licenses were required in the future, including as a result of expanding our operations, our ability to conduct business may be disrupted, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe craft beer business is seasonal in nature, and we are likely to experience fluctuations in results of operations.\nSales of craft beer products are somewhat seasonal, with the first and fourth quarters historically being lower and the rest of the year generating stronger sales. Our sales volume may also be affected by weather conditions and selling days within a particular period. Therefore, the results for any given quarter will likely not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. If an adverse event such as a regional economic downturn or poor weather conditions should occur during the second and third quarters, the adverse impact to our revenues would likely be greater as a result of the seasonality of our business.\nWe may be unable to access public or private debt markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms, or in sufficient amounts, if at all.\nWe depend, in part, on our revolving line of credit with Bank of America, N.A. (\"BofA\"), to fund our operations and commitments for capital expenditures. This credit line expires in 2020. Our capital expenditures in 2018 are expected to range from $16 million to $19 million. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include general economic conditions, disruptions or declines in the global capital markets, our financial performance or outlook, and credit. An adverse change in any or all of these factors may materially adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments.\nIf our business does not perform as expected, including if we generate less revenue than anticipated from our operations or encounter significant unexpected costs, we may fail to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facilities. If we do not comply with our financial covenants and we do not obtain a waiver or amendment, BofA may elect to cause all amounts owed to become immediately due and payable. Any default may require us to seek additional capital or modifications to our credit facilities, which may not be available or which may be costly. Any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe have entered into strategic relationships with certain regional brewers that increase the complexity and execution risks of our operations.\nWe have entered into strategic relationships with certain regional brewers, including Appalachian Mountain Brewery in North Carolina, Cisco Brewers in Massachusetts, and Wynwood Brewing Co. in Miami, Florida. These new relationships have added to the complexity of our operations, including brewing, packaging, marketing and selling their brands, with increased demands on our management team. There can be no assurance that we will be able to take full advantage of these strategic opportunities without experiencing unexpected costs, operating challenges or control deficiencies.\nAcquisitions subject us to various risks, including risks relating to selection and pricing of acquisition targets, integration of acquired companies into our business and assumption of unanticipated liabilities.\nWe have acquired two craft brewers since 2008, as well as a 24.5% equity interest in Wynwood Brewing Company, LLC, in July 2017. We may pursue additional acquisitions or joint venture or investment opportunities. We cannot assure, however, that we will be able to identify or take advantage of such opportunities. If we do pursue such transactions, we may not realize the anticipated benefits. Acquisitions involve many risks, including risks relating to the assumption of unforeseen liabilities of an acquired business, adverse accounting charges resulting from the acquisition, and difficulties in integrating acquired companies into our business, both from a cultural perspective, as well as with respect to technological integration. Our inability to successfully integrate acquired businesses or manage joint ventures may lead to increased costs, failure to generate expected returns, or even a total loss of amounts invested, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nChanges in state laws regarding distribution arrangements may adversely impact our operations.\nStates in which we have a significant sales presence may enact legislation that significantly alters the competitive environment for the beer distribution industry. Any change in the competitive environment in those states could have an adverse effect on our future sales and results of operations and may impact the financial stability of wholesalers on which we rely.\nWe are dependent on certain suppliers for key raw materials, packaging materials and production inputs.\nAlthough we seek to maintain back-up and alternative suppliers for all key raw materials and production inputs, we are reliant on certain third parties for key raw materials, packaging materials and utilities. Any disruption in the willingness or ability of these third parties to supply these critical components could hinder our ability to continue production of our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to litigation that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various types of litigation, including fair trade practice, product liability, and employment-related claims. Such litigation may be time consuming, distracting and costly, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See Note 17, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements found in Part II, Item 8 of this report, for additional information related to legal proceedings.\nAny change in, or violation of, federal and state environmental regulations could adversely affect our operations.\nOur brewing operations are subject to environmental regulations and local permitting requirements and agreements regarding, among other things, air emissions, water discharges and the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes. While we have no reason to believe the operation of our breweries violates any such regulation or requirement, if such a violation were to occur, or if environmental regulations were to become more stringent in the future, we may be adversely affected.\nA small number of shareholders hold a significant ownership percentage of our common stock and uncertainty over their continuing ownership plans could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nAs noted above, A-B has a significant ownership stake in us. In addition, three of our founders, together, beneficially own approximately 2.3 million shares, or 11.7%, of our common stock. Collectively, these two groups own 43.1% of our equity. All of these shares are available for sale in the public market, subject to volume, manner of sale and other requirements under the Securities Act of 1933. Such sales in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay and are limited in our ability to declare or pay dividends; accordingly, shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends. Further, under our loan agreement with BofA, we are not permitted to declare or pay a dividend unless we meet certain financial covenants. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to shareholders. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nThe fair value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, may become impaired.\nAs a result of the acquisition of Kona Brewing Company, we have recognized a significant increase in our total intangible assets, including goodwill. As of December 31, 2017, we had $28.9 million in an assortment of intangible assets, on a net basis, which represented nearly 13.8% of our total assets. If any circumstances were to occur, such as economic recession or other factors causing a reduction in consumer demand, or for any other reason we were to experience a significant decrease in sales growth, with a corresponding negative impact on our estimated cash flows associated with these assets, our analyses of these assets may conclude that a decrease in the fair value of these assets has occurred. In that event, we would be required to recognize a potentially significant loss on impairment of these assets. Any such impairment loss would be charged against current operations in the period of change and potentially have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 82176, "SIC": 2082, "TIC": "BREW"}
