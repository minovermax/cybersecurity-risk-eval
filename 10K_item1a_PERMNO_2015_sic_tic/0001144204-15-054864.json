RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and prospects are subject to the following risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently foreseeable to us may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and our stockholders may lose all or part of their investment in the shares of our common stock.\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d or \u201canticipation\u201d or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward- looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nRisks Specific to Our Business\nOur company is a development stage company that has no products approved for commercial sale, never generated any revenues and may never achieve revenues or profitability.\nOur company is a development stage company that has no products approved for commercial sale, never generated any revenues and may never achieve revenues or profitability. We are a development stage biopharmaceutical company. Currently, we have no products approved for commercial sale and, to date, we have not generated any revenues. Our ability to generate revenue depends heavily on:\n\u2022 demonstration and proof of principle in pre-clinical trials that a nanoviricide is safe and effective;\n\u2022 successful development of our first product candidates FluCide, Nanoviricide Eye Drops, HIVCide, HerpeCide or another one of the drug candidates in our pipeline;\n\u2022 our ability to seek and obtain regulatory approvals, including with respect to the indications we are seeking;\n\u2022 the successful commercialization of our product candidates; and\n\u2022 market acceptance of our products.\nAll of our existing product candidates are in early stages of development. It will be several years, if ever, until we have a commercial drug product available for resale. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize these products, we will not achieve revenues or profitability in the foreseeable future, if at all. If we are unable to generate revenues or achieve profitability, we may be unable to continue our operations.\nWe are a development stage company with a limited operating history, making it difficult for you to evaluate our business and your investment. We are in the development stage and our operations and the development of our proposed products are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 the absence of an operating history;\n\u2022 the lack of commercialized products;\n\u2022 insufficient capital;\n\u2022 expected substantial and continual losses for the foreseeable future;\n\u2022 limited experience in dealing with regulatory issues; the lack of manufacturing experience and limited marketing experience;\n\u2022 an expected reliance on third parties for the development and commercialization of our proposed products;\n\u2022 a competitive environment characterized by numerous, well-established and well capitalized competitors; and\n\u2022 reliance on key personnel.\nBecause we are subject to these risks, you may have a difficult time evaluating our business and your investment in our company.\nOur ability to become profitable depends primarily on the following factors:\n\u2022 our ability to develop drugs, obtain approval for such drugs, and if approved, to successfully commercialize our nanoviricide drug(s);\n\u2022 our R&D efforts, including the timing and cost of clinical trials; and\n\u2022 our ability to enter into favorable alliances with third-parties who can provide substantial capabilities in clinical development, regulatory affairs, sales, marketing and distribution.\nEven if we successfully develop and market our drug candidates, we may not generate sufficient or sustainable revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses and may not ever be profitable. As of June 30, 2015, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $31,467,748. Also, the Company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $54,099,572 at June 30, 2015. Such losses are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. As a result of recent financing, the Company estimates that it has sufficient cash to support current operations through the next two years, i.e. through June, 2017.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations and we may be unable to raise such funds when needed and on acceptable terms.\nWe currently do not have sufficient resources to complete the development and commercialization of any of our proposed products. As of June 30, 2015, we have a cash and cash equivalent balance of $31,467,748 which will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twenty four months at our budgeted rate of expenditures.\nIn the event that we cannot obtain acceptable financing, or that we are unable to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, we would be unable to complete development of our various drug candidates. This would necessitate implementing staff reductions and operational adjustments that would include reductions in the following business areas:\n\u2022 research and development programs;\n\u2022 preclinical studies and clinical trials; material characterization studies, regulatory processes;\n\u2022 establishment of our own laboratory or a search for third party marketing partners to market our products for us.\nThe amount of capital we may need will depend on many factors, including the:\n\u2022 progress, timing and scope of our research and development programs;\n\u2022 progress, timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022 time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 time and cost necessary to establish our own marketing capabilities or to seek marketing partners;\n\u2022 time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;\n\u2022 changes made or new developments in our existing collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships; and\n\u2022 new collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish.\nOur fixed expenses, such as rent, license payments and other contractual commitments, may increase in the future, as we may:\n\u2022 enter into leases for new facilities and capital equipment;\n\u2022 enter into additional licenses and collaborative agreements; and\n\u2022 incur additional expenses associated with being a public company.\nWe have limited experience in drug development and may not be able to successfully develop any drugs.\nUntil the formation of NanoViricide, Inc. (the Company\u2019s predecessor prior to the reverse merger in 2005) our management and key personnel had no experience in pharmaceutical drug development and, consequently, may not be able to successfully develop any drugs. Our ability to achieve revenues and profitability in our business will depend, among other things, on our ability to:\n\u2022 develop products internally or obtain rights to them from others on favorable terms;\n\u2022 complete laboratory testing and human studies;\n\u2022 obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products;\n\u2022 successfully complete regulatory review to obtain requisite governmental agency approvals;\n\u2022 enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture our products on our behalf; and\n\u2022 enter into arrangements with third parties to provide sales and marketing functions.\nDevelopment of pharmaceutical products is a time-consuming process, subject to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Consequently, we can provide no assurance of the successful and timely development of new drugs.\nOur drug candidates are in their developmental stage. Further development and extensive testing will be required to determine their technical feasibility and commercial viability. Our success will depend on our ability to achieve scientific and technological advances and to translate such advances into reliable, commercially competitive drugs on a timely basis. Drugs that we may develop are not likely to be commercially available for a few years. The proposed development schedules for our drug candidates may be affected by a variety of factors, including technological difficulties, proprietary technology of others, and changes in government regulation, many of which will not be within our control. Any delay in the development, introduction or marketing of our drug candidates could result either in such drugs being marketed at a time when their cost and performance characteristics would not be competitive in the marketplace or in the shortening of their commercial lives. In light of the long-term nature of our projects, the unproven technology involved and the other factors described elsewhere in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, we may not be able to complete successfully the development or marketing of any drugs.\nWe may fail to successfully develop and commercialize our drug candidates because they:\n\u2022 are found to be unsafe or ineffective in clinical trials;\n\u2022 do not receive necessary approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies;\n\u2022 fail to conform to a changing standard of care for the diseases they seek to treat; or\n\u2022 are less effective or more expensive than current or alternative treatment methods.\nDrug development failure can occur at any stage of clinical trials and as a result of many factors and there can be no assurance that we or our collaborators will reach our anticipated clinical targets. Even if we or our collaborators complete our clinical trials, we do not know what the long-term effects of exposure to our drug candidates will be. Furthermore, our drug candidates may be used in combination with other treatments and there can be no assurance that such use will not lead to unique safety issues. Failure to complete clinical trials or to prove that our drug candidates are safe and effective would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and could require us to reduce the scope of or discontinue our operations.\nWe must comply with significant and complex government regulations, compliance with which may delay or prevent the commercialization of our drug candidates.\nThe R&D, manufacture and marketing of drug candidates are subject to regulation, primarily by the FDA in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. These national agencies and other federal, state, local and foreign entities regulate, among other things, R&D activities (including testing in primates and in humans) and the testing, manufacturing, handling, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of the products that we are developing. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in various adverse consequences, including approval delays or refusals to approve drug licenses or other applications, suspension or termination of clinical investigations, revocation of approvals previously granted, fines, criminal prosecution, recalls or seizures of products, injunctions against shipping drugs and total or partial suspension of production and/or refusal to allow a company to enter into governmental supply contracts.\nThe process of obtaining FDA approval has historically been costly and time consuming. Current FDA requirements for a new human drug or biological product to be marketed in the United States include: (1) the successful conclusion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests, if appropriate, to gain preliminary information on the product\u2019s safety; (2) filing with the FDA of an IND application to conduct human clinical trials for drugs or biologics; (3) the successful completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use; and (4) filing by a company and acceptance and approval by the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for a drug product or a biological license application, or BLA, for a biological product to allow commercial distribution of the drug or biologic. A delay in one or more of the procedural steps outlined above could be harmful to us in terms of getting our drug candidates through clinical testing and to market.\nThe FDA reviews the results of the clinical trials and may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of clinical trials at any time if it believes the drug candidate exposes clinical subjects to an unacceptable health risk. Investigational drugs used in clinical studies must be produced in compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or GMP, rules pursuant to FDA regulations.\nSales outside the United States of products that we develop will also be subject to regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing for drugs and biological products and devices. The requirements vary widely from country to country, but typically the registration and approval process takes several years and requires significant resources. In most cases, even if the FDA has not approved a product for sale in the United States, the product may be exported to any country if it complies with the laws of that country and has valid marketing authorization by the appropriate authority. There are specific FDA regulations that govern this process.\nWe also are subject to the following risks and obligations, related to the approval of our products:\n\u2022 The FDA or foreign regulators may interpret data from pre-clinical testing and clinical trials in different ways than we interpret them.\n\u2022 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be limited to specific indications or limited with respect to its distribution.\n\u2022 In addition, many foreign countries control pricing and coverage under their respective national social security systems.\n\u2022 The FDA or foreign regulators may not approve our manufacturing processes or manufacturing facilities.\n\u2022 The FDA or foreign regulators may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\n\u2022 Even if regulatory approval for any product is obtained, the marketing license will be subject to continual review, and newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may result in suspension or revocation of the marketing license.\n\u2022 If regulatory approval of the product candidate is granted, the marketing of that product would be subject to adverse event reporting requirements and a general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses.\n\u2022 In some foreign countries, we may be subject to official release requirements that require each batch of the product we produce to be officially released by regulatory authorities prior to its distribution by us.\n\u2022 We will be subject to continual regulatory review and periodic inspection and approval of manufacturing modifications, including compliance with current GMP regulations.\nWe can provide no assurance that our drug candidates will obtain regulatory approval or that the results of clinical studies will be favorable.\nThe Company reports summary of its studies as the data become available to the Company, after analyzing and verifying same, in its press releases.\nIn accord with our work-plan we filed a pre-IND application with the US FDA, and held a meeting with the US FDA for our anti-influenza drug candidate, NV-INF-1 in March, 2012. Subsequent to that, we have a developed an orally available anti-influenza drug candidate based on our nanoviricides technology. This may be the first time ever that a targeted nanomedicine with activity when given orally has been developed and such activity demonstrated in vivo. We are now performing certain preclinical animal studies on this drug candidate. A set of these studies is designed to evaluate the safety and toxicology in animal models. Another set of the studies is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug in animals. In addition, we have begun to perform efficacy studies using multiple different unrelated types and subtypes of influenza viruses in order to assess the broad-spectrum anti-influenza activity of our drug candidates. The efficacy studies are being performed in various in vitro (cell culture) models as well as in vivo (animal) models. In addition, we are performing certain chemical and physical characterizations, chemistry synthesis process optimizations, and quality control and quality assurance studies. Further, we need to scale up the syntheses to a larger scale of about 1kg. These chemistry, characterization, manufacturing, and quality studies will form part of the CMC package (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls). The data will then be used to file an IND application or its overseas equivalent, towards the goal of obtaining regulatory approval for testing the drugs in humans.\nOn July 23, 2012 the Company announced that it had retained Australian Biologics Pty. Ltd, a regulatory affairs consulting firm, to coordinate the regulatory review and approval to conduct the first human trials in Australia for Flucide\u2122, the Company\u2019s broad spectrum anti-influenza drug. Australian Biologics Pty. Ltd will also facilitate clinical trial site selection and development of clinical trial agreements which we intend to pursue. The Company has previously retained the Biologics Consulting Group for helping us formulate our regulatory strategy, design the studies to be performed, and develop the IND application for submission to the US FDA.\nThe testing, marketing and manufacturing of any product for use in the United States will require approval from the FDA. We cannot predict with any certainty the amount of time necessary to obtain such FDA approval and whether any such approval will ultimately be granted. Preclinical and clinical trials may reveal that one or more products are ineffective or unsafe, in which event further development of such products could be seriously delayed or terminated. Moreover, obtaining approval for certain products may require testing on human subjects of substances whose effects on humans are not fully understood or documented. Delays in obtaining FDA or any other necessary regulatory approvals of any proposed drug and failure to receive such approvals would have an adverse effect on the drug\u2019s potential commercial success and on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that a proposed drug may be found to be ineffective or unsafe due to conditions or facts that arise after development has been completed and regulatory approvals have been obtained. In this event, we may be required to withdraw such proposed drug from the market. To the extent that our success will depend on any regulatory approvals from government authorities outside of the United States that perform roles similar to that of the FDA, uncertainties similar to those stated above will also exist.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals, our marketed drug candidates will be subject to ongoing regulatory review. If we fail to comply with continuing U.S. and foreign regulations, we could lose our approvals to market these drugs and our business would be seriously harmed.\nFollowing any initial regulatory approval of any drugs we may develop, we will also be subject to continuing regulatory review, including the review of adverse experiences and clinical results that are reported after our drug candidates are made commercially available. This would include results from any post-marketing tests or vigilance required as a condition of approval. The manufacturer and manufacturing facilities we use to make any of our drug candidates will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA. The discovery of any previously unknown problems with the drug, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the drug or manufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the drug from the market. If we are required to withdraw all or more of our drugs from the market, we may be unable to continue revenue generating operations. We do not have, and currently do not intend to develop, the ability to manufacture material for our clinical trials or on a commercial scale. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured drugs ourselves, including reliance on the third-party manufacturer for regulatory compliance. Our drug promotion and advertising is also subject to regulatory requirements and continuing FDA review.\nDevelopment of our drug candidates requires a significant investment in R&D. Our R&D expenses in turn, are subject to variation based on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. A sudden or significant increase in our R&D expenses could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe have expended $31,175,063 on research and development from inception through June 30, 2015.\nWe have estimated a total cash expenditure budget of approximately $8M for the next 12 months, of which approximately $6M is expected to go towards research and development for our drug candidates, including IND-enabling studies of two of our lead drug candidates, namely Injectable FluCide, and HerpeCide Skin Cream, and approximately $2M is budgeted for general and administrative expenses.\nIn the prior years we have established lead compounds against a number of viral diseases and completed animal studies proof of principle against a number of viral diseases. We now have lead drug compounds against all Influenzas, HIV, Viral diseases of the Eye, Oral and Genital Herpes, Herpes Keratitis, possibly Shingles, and Dengue viruses. We are currently working on identifying and establishing collaborations with pharmaceutical companies as well as government institutions for the purpose of co- development of these products. Notwithstanding these efforts, we will continue the development of these drugs, as well as our other drug development endeavors that include Rabies, Dengue viruses, and Ebola/Marburg viruses.\nWe currently have sufficient funds on hand to take at least one drug candidate through initial human clinical trials, and at least one or two drug candidates towards regulatory submissions for starting human clinical trials. We believe we will be pursuing Injectable FlucideTM and HerpeCide\u2122 as our first two drug candidates for an IND and initiating human clinical trials. Beyond this development, we estimate that we may need approximately an additional $10M to $15M for human development of the Ocular HerpeCide, Oral Flucide and Denguecide drug candidates towards IND filing over the next 36-48 months. The additional funds will also be needed to pay additional personnel, increased subcontract costs related to the expansion and further development of our drug pipeline, and for additional capital and operational expenditures required to file the additional IND applications.\nThe Company will be unable to proceed with its business plan beyond approximately June 30, 2017, without obtaining additional financing to support its budgeted Research and Development and other costs.\nBecause we expect to expend substantial resources on R&D, our success depends in large part on the results as well as the costs of our R&D. A failure in our R&D efforts or substantial increase in our R&D expenses would adversely affect our results of operations. R&D expenditures are uncertain and subject to much fluctuation. Factors affecting our R&D expenses include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 the number and outcome of clinical studies we are planning to conduct; for example, our R&D expenses may increase based on the number of late-stage clinical studies that we may be required to conduct;\n\u2022 the number of drugs entering into pre-clinical development from research; for example, there is no guarantee that internal research efforts will succeed in generating sufficient data for us to make a positive development decision;\n\u2022 licensing activities, including the timing and amount of related development funding or milestone payments; for example, we may enter into agreements requiring us to pay a significant up-front fee for the purchase of in-process R&D that we may record as R&D expense.\nWe have no experience in conducting or supervising clinical trials and must outsource all clinical trials.\nWe have no experience in conducting or supervising clinical trials that must be performed to obtain data to submit in concert with applications for approval by the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The regulatory process to obtain approval for drugs for commercial sale involves numerous steps. Drugs are subjected to clinical trials that allow development of case studies to examine safety, efficacy, and other issues to ensure that sale of drugs meets the requirements set forth by various governmental agencies, including the FDA. In the event that our protocols do not meet standards set forth by the FDA, or that our data is not sufficient to allow such trials to validate our drugs in the face of such examination, we might not be able to meet the requirements that allow our drugs to be approved for sale.\nBecause we have no experience in conducting or supervising clinical trials, we must outsource our clinical trials to third parties. We have no control over their compliance with procedures and protocols used to complete clinical trails in accordance with standards required by the agencies that approve drugs for sale. If these subcontractors fail to meet these standards, the validation of our drugs would be adversely affected, causing a delay in our ability to meet revenue-generating operations.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in conducting clinical trials. The risk of non compliance with FDA-approved good clinical practices by clinical investigators, clinical sites, or data management services could delay or prevent us from developing or ever commercializing our drug candidates.\nAgreements with clinical investigators and medical institutions for clinical testing and with other third parties for data management services place substantial responsibilities on these parties, which could result in delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials if these parties fail to perform as expected. For example, if any of our clinical trial sites fail to comply with FDA-approved good clinical practices, we may be unable to use the data gathered at those sites. If these clinical investigators, medical institutions or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our drug candidates.\nWe or regulators may suspend or terminate our clinical trials for a number of reasons. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to the patients enrolled in our clinical trials. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to the patients enrolled in our clinical trials.\nOur clinical trial operations will be subject to regulatory inspections at any time. If regulatory inspectors conclude that we or our clinical trial sites are not in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements for conducting clinical trials, we may receive reports of observations or warning letters detailing deficiencies, and we will be required to implement corrective actions. If regulatory agencies deem our responses to be inadequate, or are dissatisfied with the corrective actions that we or our clinical trial sites have implemented, our clinical trials may be temporarily or permanently discontinued, we may be fined, we or our investigators may be precluded from conducting any ongoing or any future clinical trials, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our drug candidates or we may be criminally prosecuted. If we are unable to complete clinical trials and have our products approved due to our failure to comply with regulatory requirements, we will be unable to commence revenue generating operations.\nEfforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may adversely affect our revenues even if we were to develop an FDA approved drug.\nOur ability to earn sufficient returns on our drug candidates may depend in part on the extent to which government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other organizations will provide reimbursement for the costs of such drugs and related treatments. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care drugs, and we do not know whether adequate third-party coverage will be available for our drug candidates. If our current and proposed drugs are not considered cost-effective, reimbursement to the consumers may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell drugs on a competitive basis. The failure of the government and third-party payors to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement rates for our drug candidates could adversely affect the market acceptance of our drug candidates, our competitive position and our financial performance.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information. Disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information could compromise any competitive advantage that we have.\nWe depend upon confidentiality agreements with our officers, employees, consultants, and subcontractors to maintain the proprietary nature of the technology. These measures may not afford us sufficient or complete protection, and may not afford an adequate remedy in the event of an unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently develop technology similar to ours, otherwise avoiding the confidentiality agreements, or produce patents that would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe will rely upon licensed patents to protect our technology. We may be unable to obtain or protect such intellectual property rights, and we may be liable for infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and the proprietary technology of others with which we have entered into licensing agreements. We have exclusively licensed patent applications from TheraCour Pharma, Inc. and expect to file patents of our own in the coming years. There can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will ultimately result in the issuance of a patent with respect to the technology owned by us or licensed to us. The patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the United States Patent and Trademark Office use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. Accordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others. Further, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, know-how, technology and nondisclosure, and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our rights in the technology. If any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not believe that any of the drug candidates we are currently developing infringe upon the rights of any third parties nor are they infringed upon by third parties; however, there can be no assurance that our technology will not be found in the future to infringe upon the rights of others or be infringed upon by others. In such a case, others may assert infringement claims against us, and should we be found to infringe upon their patents, or otherwise impermissibly utilize their intellectual property, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed on such parties\u2019 patent rights. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, we may be required to obtain licenses from the holders of this intellectual property, enter into royalty agreements, or redesign our drug candidates so as not to utilize this intellectual property, each of which may prove to be uneconomical or otherwise impossible. Conversely, we may not always be able to successfully pursue our claims against others that infringe upon our technology and the technology exclusively licensed from the TheraCour Pharma Inc. Thus, the proprietary nature of our technology or technology licensed by us may not provide adequate protection against competitors.\nMoreover, the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to our patents and other intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and the litigation would divert our management\u2019s efforts. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations.\nOther companies or organizations may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our drug candidates.\nWe are in a relatively new scientific field that has generated many different patent applications from organizations and individuals seeking to obtain important patents in the field. Because the field is so new, very few of these patent applications have been fully processed by government patent offices around the world, and there is a great deal of uncertainty about which patents will issue, when, to whom, and with what claims. It is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings, such as interference proceedings in various patent offices, relating to patent rights in the field. Others may attempt to invalidate our patents or other intellectual property rights. Even if our rights are not directly challenged, disputes among third parties could lead to the weakening or invalidation of those intellectual property rights.\nThus, it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we will need a license. Any license required under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, such licenses are likely to be non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and drug candidates, which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations.\nWe are dependent upon TheraCour Pharma Inc. for the rights to develop the products we intend to sell.\nOur ability to develop, manufacture and sell the products the Company plans to develop is derived from our \u201cMaterial Licensing Agreement\u201d with TheraCour Pharma Inc. (\u201cTheraCour\u201d). While we hold the license in perpetuity, the Agreement may be terminated by TheraCour as a result of: the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings by or against the Company, a general assignment by the Company to is creditors, the dissolution of the Company, cessation by the Company of business operations for ninety (90) days or more or the commencement by the Company or an affiliate to challenge or invalidate the issued patents.\nThe Company does not hold the rights to any other patents nor does the Company conduct its own research and development to develop other products to manufacture and sell. If the Company\u2019s Agreement with TheraCour is terminated, it is unlikely we will be able to commence revenue-generating operations or that the Company could continue operating at all.\nWe lack suitable facilities for clinical testing; reliance on third parties.\nThe Company does not have facilities that could be used to conduct clinical testing. We expect to contract with third parties to conduct all clinical testing required to obtain approvals for any drugs that we might develop. We currently outsource all clinical testing to a number of third parties in various collaborations and service contracts. In addition, KARD Scientific is not under contract to perform studies for us, and studies are commissioned with KARD on an as needed basis. Any of our collaborators or service providers may discontinue the service contract or collaboration. We will then be required to modify our priorities and goals, obtain other collaborators or service providers to replace the ones we lose, or we may even be forced to abandon certain drug development programs. In addition, any failures by third parties to adequately perform their responsibilities may delay the submission of our proposed products for regulatory approval, impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or otherwise impair our competitive position.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience.\nThe Company has never manufactured products in the highly regulated environment of pharmaceutical manufacturing. There are numerous regulations and requirements that must be maintained to obtain licensure and the permits required to commence manufacturing, as well as additional requirements to continue manufacturing pharmaceutical products. We do not own or lease facilities currently that could be used to manufacture any products that might be developed by the Company, nor do we have the resources at this time to acquire or lease suitable facilities.\nWe have no sales and marketing personnel.\nWe are an early stage development Company with limited resources. We do not currently have any products available for sale, so have not secured sales and marketing staff at this early stage of operations. We cannot generate sales without sales or marketing staff and must rely on officers to provide any sales or marketing services until such staff are secured, if ever. Even if we were to successfully develop approvable drugs, we will not be able to sell these drugs if we or our third party manufacturers fail to comply with manufacturing regulations.\nIf we were to successfully develop approvable drugs, before we can begin selling these drugs, we must obtain regulatory approval of our manufacturing facility and process or the manufacturing facility and process of the third party or parties with whom we may outsource our manufacturing activities. In addition, the manufacture of our products must comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations, commonly known as GMP regulations. The GMP regulations govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures. Our manufacturing facilities, if any in the future and the manufacturing facilities of our third party manufacturers will be continually subject to inspection by the FDA and other state, local and foreign regulatory authorities, before and after product approval. We cannot guarantee that we, or any potential third party manufacturer of our products, will be able to comply with the GMP regulations or other applicable manufacturing regulations.\nAs of the date of this filing, we have three employees and several consultants and independent contractors. The only consultant/contractor that we consider critical to the Company is TheraCour, discussed in the next risk factor. KARD Scientific, another consultant/contractor (See ITEM 1. Background: Collaborations and Subcontract Arrangements) is considered by the Company important but not critical as they are replaceable with moderate difficulty. All other consultant/contractors would be more readily replaceable. While the Company\u2019s current operations cause it to be unlikely that we will need to grow and hire additional consultants, contractors or employees, if future preclinical studies of our nanoviricide drugs and technology show significant improvements in efficacy over existing drugs, we intend to expand our operations and staff materially. At that time our new employees may include a number of key managerial, technical, financial, R&D and operations personnel who will not have been fully integrated into our operations. We would expect the expansion of our business to place a significant strain on our limited managerial, operational and financial resources. We have no experience in integrating multiple employees. Therefore, there is a substantial risk that we will not be able to integrate new employees into our operations which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe license our core technology from TheraCour Pharma Inc. and we are dependent upon them as they have exclusive development rights. If we lose the right to utilize any of the proprietary information that is the subject of this license agreement, we may incur substantial delays and costs in development of our drug candidates .\nThe Company has entered into a Material License Agreement with TheraCour Pharma, Inc. (\u201cTheraCour\u201d) (a approximately 16.8% shareholder of the Company\u2019s common stock) whereby TheraCour has exclusive rights to develop exclusively for us, the materials that comprise the core drugs of our planned business. TheraCour is a development stage company with limited financial resources and needs the Company\u2019s progress payments to further the development of the nanoviricides. The Company controls the research and work TheraCour performs on its behalf and no costs may be incurred without the prior authorization or approval of the Company. No royalties are due to TheraCour from the Company\u2019s inception through June 30, 2015.\nWe depend on TheraCour and other third parties to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis. If these third parties fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval, and these events could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our ability to commence revenue generating operations. The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated, and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We and our manufacturers are subject to the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices, which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record-keeping and quality standards and similar regulations are in effect in other countries. In addition, our manufacturing operations are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies.\nOur collaborative relationships with third parties could cause us to expend significant resources and incur substantial business risk with no assurance of financial return.\nWe anticipate substantial reliance upon strategic collaborations for marketing and the commercialization of our drug candidates and we may rely even more on strategic collaborations for R&D of our other drug candidates. Our business depends on our ability to sell drugs to both government agencies and to the general pharmaceutical market. Offering our drug candidates for non-medical applications to government agencies does not require us to develop new sales, marketing or distribution capabilities beyond those already existing in the company. Selling antiviral drugs, however, does require such development. We plan to sell antiviral drugs through strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical companies. If we are unable to establish or manage such strategic collaborations on terms favorable to us in the future, our revenue and drug development may be limited. To date, we have not entered into any strategic collaborations with third parties capable of providing these services. In addition, we have not yet marketed or sold any of our drug candidates or entered into successful collaborations for these services in order to ultimately commercialize our drug candidates.\nIf we determine to enter into R&D collaborations during the early phases of drug development, our success will in part depend on the performance of our research collaborators. We will not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by our research collaborators to activities related to our drug candidates. Our research collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our programs. If any research collaborator fails to commit sufficient resources, our preclinical or clinical development programs related to this collaboration could be delayed or terminated. Also, our collaborators may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. Finally, if we fail to make required milestone or royalty payments to our collaborators or to observe other obligations in our agreements with them, our collaborators may have the right to terminate those agreements.\nManufacturers producing our drug candidates must follow current GMP regulations enforced by the FDA and foreign equivalents. If a manufacturer of our drug candidates does not conform to the current GMP regulations and cannot be brought up to such a standard, we will be required to find alternative manufacturers that do conform. This may be a long and difficult process, and may delay our ability to receive FDA or foreign regulatory approval of our drug candidates and cause us to fall behind on our business objectives.\nEstablishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our discussion with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position. Even if we successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of our drug candidates or the generation of sales revenue. To the extent that we enter into collaborative arrangements, our drug revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold any drugs that we may develop.\nManagement of our relationships with our collaborators will require:\n\u2022 significant time and effort from our management team;\n\u2022 coordination of our marketing and R&D programs with the marketing and R&D priorities of our collaborators; and\n\u2022 effective allocation of our resources to multiple projects.\nWe employ the use of certain chemical and biological agents and compounds that may be deemed hazardous and we are therefore subject to various environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant costs, which could materially reduce our ability to become profitable.\nWe use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. As appropriate, we safely store these materials and wastes resulting from their use at our laboratory facility pending their ultimate use or disposal. We contract with a third party to properly dispose of these materials and wastes. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. We may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations adopted in the future.\nIf we use biological and hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we may be liable for damages.\nOur R&D and manufacturing activities will involve the use of biological and hazardous materials. Although we believe our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. We carry $1,000,000 casualty and general liability insurance policies. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources and insurance coverage, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel.\nOur ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel is critical to our operations and expansion. We face competition for these types of personnel from other pharmaceutical companies and more established organizations, many of which have significantly larger operations and greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining these personnel, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend upon our senior management and their loss or unavailability could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe currently depend upon the efforts and abilities of our management team. The loss or unavailability of the services of any of these individuals for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We have not obtained, do not own, nor are we the beneficiary of key-person life insurance for all of our key personnel.\nThe Company believes that its two executive officers, Eugene Seymour, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Anil Diwan, President and Chairman of Board, are critical to the success of the Company. The Company is a limited beneficiary of a certain amount of key man insurance for these two executive officers that the Company maintains. However there can be no assurances that the amount of the key man insurance coverage would be sufficient to provide replacement of these key officers for continuing the Company\u2019s operations in a timely manner, should such an event arise.\nThe Company also maintains a limited amount of Directors and Officers Liability insurance coverage to protect all of its directors and executive officers taken together. There can be no assurance that this D&O coverage will be sufficient to cover the costs of the events that may lead to its invocation, in which case, there could be a substantial impact on the Company\u2019s ability to continue operations, should such an unforeseen event occur.\nOn March 3, 2010, the Company entered into employment agreements with its two executive officers, Eugene Seymour, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Anil Diwan, President and Chairman of Board. Both agreements provide a minimum annual base salary of $250,000 for a term of four years. In addition, Dr. Seymour and Dr. Diwan were eligible for an increase in base salary to $275,000 once the Company consummated a financing with gross proceeds of at least $5,000,000. Also, the base salary is eligible to be increased to $300,000 for Dr. Seymour and $300,000 for Dr. Diwan since the Company has been listed on a national stock exchange. As additional compensation under the employment agreements, the Company issued 71,429 (as adjusted) shares of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock and shall issue an additional 71,429 (as adjusted) shares of Series A Preferred Stock on each anniversary of the respective employment agreements. The prior employment agreements expired as of February 29, 2014 and Drs. Diwan and Seymour continued to work on the basis of such expired agreements at a salary of $300,000 per annum.\nOn July 21, 2015, the Company entered into new employment agreements with Dr. Diwan and Dr. Seymour, effective July 1, 2015. The terms of the agreements, as more fully set forth below, were determined by the Registrant\u2019s independent Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors based upon comparative compensation reports prepared by an independent third-party research firm. The Compensation Committee determined that the proposed compensation for Drs. Diwan and Seymour were in line with similar publicly-traded pharmaceutical companies. Both agreements provide Drs. Diwan and Seymour would receive compensation of $350,000 for the first year of employment, $375,000 for the second year and $400,000 for the final year. Additionally, both executives were awarded a grant of 225,000 shares of the Registrant\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock that vest equally over the term of the employment agreement. Any unvested shares of Series A Preferred Stock are subject to forfeiture upon termination for cause or resignation of the executive. The employment agreements also provides incentive bonuses of $75,000 per year payable on or before July 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The agreements provide for customary benefits including health and life insurance coverage, and vacation days. The agreements also provide customary terms regarding confidentiality, restrictive covenants, non-solicitation and non-disclosure.\nOn March 3, 2010, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Jayant Tatake to serve as Vice President of Research and Development. The employment agreement provides for a term of four years with a base salary of $150,000. In addition, the Company issued 26,786 (as adjusted) shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 35,715 (as adjusted) shares of common stock, and will issue an additional 26,786 (as adjusted) shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 35,715 (as adjusted) shares of common stock on each anniversary date of the agreement.\nOn March 3, 2010, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Randall Barton to serve as Chief Scientific Officer. The employment agreement provides for a term of four years with a base salary of $150,000. In addition, the Company issued 35,715 (as adjusted) shares of common stock, and will issue an additional 35,715 (as adjusted) shares of common stock on each anniversary date of the agreement.\nIn July 2014, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors unanimously agreed that these employment agreements shall continue in effect until new employment agreements become effective.\nThere are conflicts of interest among our officers, directors and stockholders.\nThe Company has a majority independent Board of Directors, a fully independent Compensation Committee, and a fully independent Audit Committee.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors and their affiliates are engaged in other activities and have interests in other entities on their own behalf or on behalf of other persons. Neither we nor our stockholders will have any rights in these ventures or their income or profits. Specifically, Anil Diwan owns approximately 70% of the capital stock of TheraCour Pharma, Inc. which owns 16.8% of our Common Stock, and 2,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred stock, provides the Company the nanomaterials with which it intends to develop its products and is the holder of the intellectual property rights the Company uses to conduct its operations. While the Company is not aware of any conflict that has arisen or any transaction that has not been conducted on an arm\u2019s length basis to date, Dr. Diwan may have conflicting fiduciary duties between the Company and TheraCour.\nIn addition, one of our independent directors, Dr. Milton Boniuk has dispositive power over 2,276,819 shares of common stock, and 187,000 shares of Series A preferred shares. In addition, Dr. Boniuk is the holder, or has dispositive power over $4,000,000 of the Company\u2019s Series B Convertible Debentures and $5,000,000 of the Company\u2019s Series C Convertible Debentures. The Company believes that as a significant investor himself, he represents the interests of the shareholders at large.\nCurrently, the Company does not allow a conflicting Shareholder, Director, or Executive Officer to vote on matters wherein a conflict may be perceived. The conflicting entity is not allowed to nominate alternate person to vote for them either. Other than this safeguard, the Company currently does not have any policy in place to deal with such should such a conflict arise\nIn particular:\n\u2022 Our executive officers or directors or their affiliates may have an economic interest in, or other business relationship with, partner companies that invest in us.\n\u2022 Our executive officers or directors or their affiliates have interests in entities that provide products or services to us.\nIn any of these cases:\n\u2022 Our executive officers or directors may have a conflict between our current interests and their personal financial and other interests in another business venture.\n\u2022 Our executive officers or directors may have conflicting fiduciary duties to us and the other entity.\n\u2022 The terms of transactions with the other entity may not be subject to arm\u2019s length negotiations and therefore may be on terms less favorable to us than those that could be procured through arm\u2019s length negotiations.\nWe anticipate entering into contracts with various U.S. government agencies. In contracting with government agencies, we will be subject to various federal contract requirements. Future sales to U.S. government agencies will depend, in part, on our ability to meet these requirements, certain of which we may not be able to satisfy.\nWe may enter into contracts with various U.S. government agencies which have special contracting requirements that give the government agency various rights or impose on the other party various obligations that can make the contracts less favorable to the non- government party. Consequently, if a large portion of our revenue is attributable to these contracts, our business may be adversely affected should the governmental parties exercise any of these additional rights or impose any of these additional obligations.\nU.S. government contracts typically contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to audit and modification by the government at its sole discretion, which subjects us to additional risks. These risks include the ability of the U.S. government to unilaterally:\n\u2022 suspend or prevent us for a set period of time from receiving new contracts or extending existing contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;\n\u2022 terminate our existing contracts;\n\u2022 reduce the scope and value of our existing contracts;\n\u2022 audit and object to our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u2022 control and potentially prohibit the export of our drug candidates; and\n\u2022 change certain terms and conditions in our contracts.\nThe U.S. government may terminate any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms. Termination for convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed, and settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions do not permit these recoveries and make us liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source.\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we may become subject to periodic audits and reviews. Based on the results of these audits, the U.S. government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. As part of any such audit or review, the U.S. government may review the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including those relating to our purchasing, property, compensation and/or management information systems. In addition, if an audit or review uncovers any improper or illegal activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of our contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. We could also suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us. In addition, under U.S. government purchasing regulations, some of our costs, including most financing costs, amortization of intangible assets, portions of our R&D costs and some marketing expenses, may not be reimbursable or allowed under our contracts. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we may become subject to an increased risk of investigations, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities to which purely private sector companies are not.\nWe may fail to obtain contracts to supply the U.S. government, and we may be unable to commercialize our drug candidates.\nThe U.S. government has undertaken commitments to help secure improved countermeasures against bio-terrorism. The process of obtaining government contracts is lengthy and uncertain, and we must compete for each contract. Moreover, the award of one government contract does not necessarily secure the award of future contracts covering the same drug. If the U.S. government makes significant future contract awards for the supply of its emergency stockpile to our competitors, our business will be harmed and it is unlikely that we will be able to ultimately commercialize our competitive drug candidate.\nIn addition, the determination of when and whether a drug is ready for large scale purchase and potential use will be made by the government through consultation with a number of government agencies, including the FDA, the NIH, the CDC and the Department of Homeland Security. Congress has approved measures to accelerate the development of bio-defense drugs through NIH funding, the review process by the FDA and the final government procurement contracting authority. While this may help speed the approval of our drug candidates, it may also encourage competitors to develop their own drug candidates.\nThe market for government stockpiling of H5N1 medicines and other antiviral drugs in the Strategic National Stockpile is fairly new and uncertain.\nAt the present many governments have already stockpiled influenza medicines for H5N1. We cannot predict with certainty the size of the market, if any for all of the antiviral drugs that the governments may want to stockpile. Consequently, we cannot predict whether sales, if any, to governments will be sufficient to fund our business plan and commence revenue-generating operations.\nIf the U.S. government fails to continue funding bio-defense drug candidate development efforts or fails to purchase sufficient quantities of any future bio-defense drug candidate, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to continue operations.\nWe hope to receive funding from the U.S. government for the development of our bio-defense drug candidates. Changes in government budgets and agendas, however, may result in future funding being decreased and de-prioritized, and government contracts typically contain provisions that permit cancellation in the event that funds are unavailable to the government agency. Furthermore, we cannot be certain of the timing of any future funding, and substantial delays or cancellations of funding could result from protests or challenges from third parties. If the U.S. government fails to continue to adequately fund R&D programs, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to continue operations. Similarly, if we develop a drug candidate that is approved by the FDA, but the U.S. government does not place sufficient orders for this drug, our future business may be harmed.\nRisks Related to the Biotechnology/Biopharmaceutical Industry\nThe biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological developments and a high degree of competition. We may be unable to compete with enterprises equipped with more substantial resources than us.\nThe biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological developments and a high degree of competition based primarily on scientific and technological factors. These factors include the availability of patent and other protection for technology and products, the ability to commercialize technological developments and the ability to obtain government approval for testing, manufacturing and marketing.\nOur anti-influenza drug in development, Flucide, would compete with neuraminidase inhibitors Tamiflu and Relenza, anti-influenza drugs that are sold by Roche and Glaxo SmithKline (GSK), respectively. Generic competitors include amantadine and rimantadine, both oral tablets that only inhibit the replication of the influenza A virus. BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing IV Infusions formulations of peramivir, an influenza neuraminidase inhibitor, for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is approved in Japan and had obtained emergency use authorization in the US. Several H5N1 bird flu, and influenza novelH1N1/2009 vaccines are also in development worldwide. Several companies are developing anti-influenza drugs and vaccines.\nWe have recently completed preliminary animal studies against HIV that have resulted in the finding that certain of our drug candidates were superior to the oral HAART cocktail in SCID-hu Thy/Liv humanized mice lethally infected with HIV-I. We thus believe that we have a very strong lead drug identified against HIV. There are several companies with anti-HIV drugs in the market. A new drug, maraviroc from Pfizer has recently been approved, which falls in a new class called CCR5-blockers. Prior to this, two new drugs in a new class called Integrase Inhibitors have been approved. A drug in the class called Entry & Fusion Inhibitors, enfuvirtide, (FuzeonTM, Roche) has also been available. Additionally, the classical drugs, NRTI\u2019s, NNRTI\u2019s and PI\u2019s (protease inhibitors) are used in various combinations. A three drug combo has been approved. A four-drug combo is expected to be approved soon. The HIVCide-I nanoviricide is expected to act by a very different kind of mechanism, defining a new class of drugs, that is complementary to the existing classes of anti-HIV drugs.\nOur nanoviricide eye drops for viral diseases of the eye are currently under development. We have shown significant clinical efficacy in an animal model of EKC (adenoviral epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis). We have also shown very strong in vitro efficacy in HSV-1 reduction in cell cultures. We believe that this drug has a very good efficacy and safety profile, based on current data. There are no approved drugs against all viral diseases of the eye, or adenoviral EKC in particular. Several drugs are available for the treatment of herpes keratitis. Idoxuridine, vidarabine, acyclovir and its derivatives, are among the leading ones. Aganocide is under development. We believe that the nanoviricide eye drops should have a significant advantage in terms of reduced frequency of application needed and simple application procedure.\nOur HCV drugs are at the earliest stage of development. There are a growing number of anti-HCV drugs being sold or in advanced stages of clinical development. Two new protease inhibitors have been approved. Companies with anti-HIV and HCV products include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), Abbott Laboratories, and Schering Plough, in addition to several other pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms.\nWe compete with specialized biopharmaceutical firms in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, as well as a growing number of large pharmaceutical companies that are applying biotechnology to their operations. Many biopharmaceutical companies have focused their development efforts in the human therapeutics area, including cancer. Many major pharmaceutical companies have developed or acquired internal biotechnology capabilities or made commercial arrangements with other biopharmaceutical companies. These companies, as well as academic institutions, government agencies and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants. Our ability to compete successfully with other companies in the pharmaceutical field will also depend to a considerable degree on the continuing availability of capital to us.\nWe are aware of numerous products under development or manufactured by competitors that are used for the prevention or treatment of certain diseases we have targeted for drug development. Various companies are developing biopharmaceutical products that potentially directly compete with our drug candidates even though their approach to such treatment is different.\nWe expect that our drug candidates under development and in clinical trials will address major markets within the anti-viral sector. Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which drugs are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. Additionally, the timing of the market introduction of some of our potential drugs or of competitors\u2019 products may be an important competitive factor. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop drugs, complete pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, approval processes and supply commercial quantities to market are important competitive factors. We expect that competition among drugs approved for sale will be based on various factors, including product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent protection.\nThe successful development of biopharmaceuticals is highly uncertain. A variety of factors including, pre-clinical study results or regulatory approvals, could cause us to abandon development of our drug candidates.\nSuccessful development of biopharmaceuticals is highly uncertain and is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Products that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for several reasons including:\n\u2022 pre-clinical study results that may show the product to be less effective than desired (e.g., the study failed to meet its primary objectives) or to have harmful or problematic side effects;\n\u2022 failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals or a delay in receiving such approvals. Among other things, such delays may be caused by slow enrollment in clinical studies, length of time to achieve study endpoints, additional time requirements for data analysis or a IND and later NDA, preparation, discussions with the FDA, an FDA request for additional pre-clinical or clinical data or unexpected safety or manufacturing issues;\n\u2022 manufacturing costs, pricing or reimbursement issues, or other factors that make the product not economical; and\n\u2022 the proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies that may prevent the product from being commercialized.\nSuccess in pre-clinical and early clinical studies does not ensure that large-scale clinical studies will be successful. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. The length of time necessary to complete clinical studies and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly from one product to the next, and may be difficult to predict.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Investments in Our Common Stock\nIf we do not meet the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT our common stock could be delisted from trading, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nAs of September 25, 2013, our common stock was listed on the NYSE MKT, a national securities exchange, which imposes continued listing requirements with respect to listed shares. If, however, we fail to satisfy the continued listing standards, such as, for example, the requirement that our shares not trade \u201cfor a substantial period of time at a low price per share\u201d or that we not dispose of our principal operating assets or discontinue a substantial portion of our operations, among other requirements, the NYSE MKT may issue another non-compliance letter or initiate delisting proceedings.\nIf our securities are delisted from trading on the NYSE MKT and we are not able to list our securities on another exchange or to have them quoted on NASDAQ, our securities could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7 a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for us; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to short-form registration statements on Form S-3 or obtain additional financing in the future).\nOur Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), which will require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs will reduce or might eliminate our profitability.\nOur Company is required to file periodic reports with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To comply with these requirements, our independent registered auditors will have to review our quarterly financial statements and audit our annual financial statements. Moreover, our legal counsel will have to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time, because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major affect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. We may be exposed to potential risks resulting from new requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the trading price of our Common Stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly, or we could become subject to Commission enforcement proceedings.\nAs currently required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015. Based on its evaluation, the Company concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Commission. The material weakness in the reporting process was due to the insufficient complement of personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge to identify and account for non-routine transactions such as derivative instruments. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the period ending June 30, 2015 indicated that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2015. We expect to continue to incur additional expenses and diversion of management\u2019s time as a result of performing the system and process evaluation, testing, and remediation required to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements.\nIf we continue to fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented, or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results would be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the trading price of our Common Stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly, or we could become subject to the Commission\u2019s enforcement proceedings.\nOur Common Stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and may be difficult to sell.\nThe Commission has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. Historically, the price of our Common Stock has fluctuated greatly. If, the market price of the Common Stock is less than $5.00 per share it therefore may be designated as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d according to Commission rules. The \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of securities and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction before the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the broker-dealer must deliver, before the transaction, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information on the limited market in penny stocks. These additional burdens imposed on broker-dealers may restrict the ability or decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to sell our common shares, and may result in decreased liquidity for our common shares and increased transaction costs for sales and purchases of our common shares as compared to other securities.\nOur stock price may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThe price of our common stock, as quoted on the NYSE MKT may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022 progress of our products through the regulatory process;\n\u2022 results of preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022 announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 government regulatory action affecting our products or our competitors\u2019 products in both the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022 developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights;\n\u2022 general market conditions for emerging growth and pharmaceutical companies;\n\u2022 economic conditions in the United States or abroad;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022 broad market fluctuations; and\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts.\nThere is a risk of market fraud.\nShareholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. We are aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.\nAs of September 25, 2013, our common stock was listed on the NYSE MKT national exchange. However, shareholders should be aware that the occurrence of the above-mentioned patterns and practices cannot be entirely precluded and that the occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.\nA registration of a significant amount of our outstanding restricted stock may have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nAt June 30, 2015, shareholders of the Company had 15,688,161 shares (as adjusted) of restricted stock, or approximately 33% of the outstanding common stock. If we were to file a registration statement including all of these shares, and the registration is allowed by the SEC, these shares would be freely tradable upon the effectiveness of the planned registration statement. If investors holding a significant number of freely tradable shares decide to sell them in a short period of time following the effectiveness of a registration statement, such sales could contribute to significant downward pressure on the price of our stock.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, any return on your investment in our capital stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of the capital stock.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, for reinvestment in the development and expansion of our business. Any credit agreements, which we may enter into with institutional lenders, may restrict our ability to pay dividends. Whether we pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and any other factors that the board of directors decides is relevant. Therefore, any return on your investment in our capital stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of the capital stock.\nWe may issue additional equity shares to fund the Company\u2019s operational requirements, which would dilute share ownership.\nThe Company\u2019s continued viability depends on its ability to raise capital. Changes in economic, regulatory or competitive conditions may lead to cost increases. Management may also determine that it is in the best interest of the Company to develop new services or products. In any such case additional financing is required for the Company to meet its operational requirements. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to the Company and at times required by the Company, if at all. In such event, the Company may be required to materially alter its business plan or curtail all or a part of its operational plans as detailed further in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K. While the Company currently has no offers to sell its securities to obtain financing, sale or the proposed sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our stock price may decline substantially. In the event that the Company is unable to raise or borrow additional funds, the Company may be required to curtail significantly its operational plans as further detailed in Requirements for Additional Capital in the Management Discussion and Analysis of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company is authorized to issue up to 150,000,000 total shares of Common Stock on a post-split basis without additional approval by shareholders. As of June 30, 2015, we had 57,242,070 shares of common stock outstanding, warrants and options convertible to 6,512,390 shares of common stock and 3,583,445 shares of Series A Preferred Stock convertible into 12,542,058 shares of Common Stock only in the event of a change in control.\nAs of September 25, 2013, our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT national exchange.\nLarge amounts of our common stock will be eligible for resale under Rule 144.\nAs of June 30, 2015, 15,688,161 of 57,242,070 issued and outstanding shares (as adjusted) of the Company\u2019s common stock were restricted securities as defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cAct\u201d) and under certain circumstances may be resold without registration pursuant to Rule 144. In addition the 3,583,445 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are restricted and convertible into 12,542,058 shares of Common Stock only in the event of a Change of Control of the Company.\nApproximately 2,285,033 shares of our restricted shares of common stock (as adjusted) are held by non-affiliates who may avail themselves of the public information requirements and sell their shares in accordance with Rule 144. As a result, some or all of these shares may be sold in accordance with Rule 144 potentially causing the price of the Company\u2019s shares to decline.\nIn general, under Rule 144, a person (or persons whose shares are aggregated) who has satisfied a six month holding period may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three-month period a number of securities which does not exceed the greater of 1% of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale. Rule 144 also permits, under certain circumstances, the sale of securities, without any limitation, by a person who is not an Affiliate, as such term is defined in Rule 144(a)(1), of the Company and who has satisfied a one-year holding period. Any substantial sale of the Company\u2019s common stock pursuant to Rule 144 may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s shares. This filing will satisfy certain public information requirements necessary for such shares to be sold under Rule 144.\nThe requirements of complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley act may strain our resources and distract management.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The costs associated with these requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Historically, as a private company we have maintained a small accounting staff, but in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant additional resources and management oversight will be required. This includes, among other things, retaining independent public accountants. This effort may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may need to hire additional accounting and financial persons with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in a timely fashion.\nSales of additional equity securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and your rights in the Company may be reduced.\nWe expect to continue to incur drug development and selling, general and administrative costs, and in order to satisfy our funding requirements, we may need to sell additional equity securities. Our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and a reduction in the price that they are able to obtain upon sale of their shares. Also, any new securities issued may have greater rights, preferences or privileges than our existing common stock that may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our stock price may decline substantially.", "PERMNO": 14133, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "NNVC"}
