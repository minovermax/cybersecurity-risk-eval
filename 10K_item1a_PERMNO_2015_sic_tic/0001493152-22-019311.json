RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS\nTHE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED OUR BUSINESS IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, AND MAY AMPLIFY THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES FACING OUR BUSINESS WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected U.S. consumer shopping patterns and caused the health of the U.S. and world economy to deteriorate in fiscal year 2022. During our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, demand for consumer electronics products including home based entertainment and toys remained strong. However, late delivery of key products for the holiday season due to global logistics issues resulted in lost sales and an increase in inventory of approximately $5.5 million greater than planned at the end of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. While many of the restrictions and measures initially implemented in response to the pandemic have since been softened or lifted in varying degrees in different locations around the world, and the manufacture and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines during calendar year 2021 and 2022 helped to initiate a recovery from the pandemic, the uncertainty regarding existing and new potential variants of COVID-19 and the success of any vaccines in respect thereof, may in the future cause a reduction in global economic activity or prompt, the re-imposition of certain restrictions and measures. In addition, even if not required by governmental authorities, increases in COVID-19 cases, such as if a new variant emerges, may result in significantly reduced economic activity, which could impact our business and our financial results.\nOUR SUPPLY CHAIN MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND GLOBAL EVENTS\nWe rely upon the facilities of our third-party manufacturers in China to manufacture our products and export our products throughout the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of COVID-19, including, among others, restrictions on manufacturing and the movement of employees in many regions of China during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 and continuing into fiscal 2022. In late calendar 2021, the increased demand for consumer electronics products and current economic recovery continued to increase worldwide demand for products using semiconductor \u201cchip\u201d components in the production of most consumer electronics which has resulted in an international shortage of chips available to fulfill demand. As a result, we have experienced longer delivery lead times and some unavailability of these components which have delayed delivery of some of our products. We have also experienced delays in delivery schedules due to new outbreaks of COVID-19 in Southern China that have forced temporary closures of some key shipping ports. The port closures have also led to a temporary shortage of shipping containers which have resulted in significant price increases due to increased demand. While we have seen the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and the impact on our business, we cannot predict the impact of the resurgence of variants of COVID-19 and other factors affecting local and global economies, specifically China.\nOUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND CAPITAL MARKETS RESULTING FROM THE CONFLICT IN UKRAINE OR ANY OTHER GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS.\nU.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the start of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops was reported. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in credit and capital markets.\nAdditionally, Russia\u2019s military interventions in Ukraine have led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the U.S., European Union and other countries against Russia. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets. In addition, the invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions imposed on Russia have resulted in increased volatility in the financial markets and the markets for certain commodities including oil, which may significantly impact the manufacturers that we rely on, but is not expected to have any direct impact on us.\nWhile the Company has not experienced any direct impact from the conflict in the Ukraine, the extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results as they impact the global economy in the future.\nCHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL TARIFFS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES, PRODUCT COST AND PROFITABILITY.\nU.S. government administration and members of the U.S. Congress have made public statements indicating possible significant changes in U.S. trade policy and have taken certain actions that may impact U.S. trade, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States. Any changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \u201ctrade wars,\u201d and increased costs for goods imported into the United States. All of our products are manufactured and imported from China. However, only our microphone products are currently subject to 7.5% tariffs currently in place. Should the government decide to expand its list of products to include our karaoke products that would subject our products to tariffs in the future, there could be a significant increase in the landed cost of our products. If we are unable to mitigate these increased costs through price increases we could experience reductions in revenues, gross profit margin and results from operations.\nA SMALL NUMBER OF OUR CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, AND THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE KEY CUSTOMERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND CASH FLOW.\nWe rely on a few large customers to provide a substantial portion of our revenues. Sales to the Company\u2019s top five customers together comprised approximately 90% of our net sales for both of our fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, revenues from three of these customers represented greater than 10% of net sales at a percentage of 37%, 18%, and 17% of total net sales. In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, revenues from four of these customers represented greater than 10% of net sales at a percentage of 36%, 20%, 13% and 12% of total net sales. We do not have long-term contractual arrangements with any of our customers and they can cancel their orders at any time prior to delivery. A substantial reduction in or termination of orders from any of our largest customers would decrease our revenues and cash flow.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT SOME OF OUR LARGE CUSTOMERS MAY RETURN KARAOKE PRODUCTS THAT THEY HAVE PURCHASED FROM US AND IF THIS HAPPENS, IT WOULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.\nIn our fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, a number of our customers and distributors returned karaoke products that they had purchased from us. Our customers returned goods valued at approximately $3.6 million or 7.5% of our net sales in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 and approximately $4.1 million or 9.1% of our net sales in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. The return of products is due to a variety of reasons including defective units, customers\u2019 overstock and buyer\u2019s remorse. The primary reason for the 1.6 percentage point decrease in returns was due to a decrease in overstock returns from our major customers. Our factories charge customary repair and freight costs which increase our expenses and reduce profitability. If any of our customers were to increase the volume of their returned karaoke products to us, it would reduce our revenues and profitability.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO PRESSURE FROM OUR CUSTOMERS RELATING TO PRICE REDUCTION AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AND IF WE ARE PRESSURED TO MAKE THESE CONCESSIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IT WILL REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.\nBecause there is intense competition in the karaoke industry, we are subject to pricing pressure from our customers. Many of our customers have demanded that we lower our prices and threatened to buy our competitor\u2019s products. If we do not meet our customer\u2019s demands to lower our regular prices, we will not sell as many karaoke products. We are also subject to pressure from our customers regarding certain financial incentives, such as return credits or large cooperative (\u201cco-op\u201d) promotion incentives, which effectively reduce our net sales and profit. We gave co-op promotion incentives of approximately $1.7 million during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 and $2.0 million during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. We have historically offered co-op promotion incentives to our customers because it is standard practice in the retail industry.\nWE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY FORECASTING THE DEMAND FOR OUR KARAOKE PRODUCTS AND IF WE DO NOT ACCURATELY FORECAST DEMAND, OUR REVENUES, NET INCOME AND CASH FLOW MAY BE AFFECTED.\nBecause of our reliance on manufacturers in China for our machine production, our production lead times range from one to four months. Therefore, we must commit to production in advance of customers\u2019 orders. It is difficult to forecast customer demand because we do not have any scientific or quantitative method to predict this demand. Our forecasting is based on management\u2019s general expectations about customer demand, the general strength of the retail market and management\u2019s historical experiences. In past years we have overestimated demand for our products which led to excess inventory in some of our products and caused liquidity problems that adversely affected our revenues, net income and cash flow.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO THE COSTS AND RISKS OF CARRYING INVENTORY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND IF WE HAVE TOO MUCH INVENTORY, IT WILL AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW FOR OPERATIONS.\nMany of our customers place orders with us several months prior to the holiday season, but they schedule delivery two or three weeks before the holiday season begins. As such, we are subject to the risks and costs of carrying inventory during the time period between the placement of the order and the delivery date, which reduces our cash flow. As of March 31, 2022 we had approximately $14.2 million in inventory as compared to $5.5 million in inventory as of March 31, 2021. The primary reasons for the increase in inventory is due to late delivery of key products for the holiday season due to global logistics issues resulting in lost sales and an increase in inventory as of March 31, 2022 of approximately $5.5 million with the remaining increase due to new product received and in-transit for a program with one major customer. If we are unable to sell this inventory during fiscal 2023 at historical or greater margins, our cash flow for operations will be negatively impacted.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO INSURANCE RISK OF LOSS FOR GOODS DAMAGED WHILE IN TRANSIT FROM THE MANUFACTURER TO THE CUSTOMER AND OUR WAREHOUSE.\nAll of our goods are manufactured in China and are transported to customers and our warehouse in California via ocean vessel. As such, we are subject to damages that may occur to these goods when they are in transit to customers or our warehouse. Should substantial damage incur while goods are in transit, we could experience a significant loss of revenue, inventory and incur significant out of pocket expenses associated with destruction of the damaged goods, which could cause a significant loss from operations and reduction in cash flow. During our fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, a major customer received goods that were significantly water damaged due to excess moisture absorbed in pallets shipped by the factory resulting in a loss of approximately $2.4 million. We recovered approximately $2.3 million from our cargo insurance coverage during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. During our fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 we also secured vendor invoice credits of approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, from the factory and factory\u2019s representative that caused the damage. While we have taken measures to prevent a similar incident in the future, there can be no guarantee that this type of damage or other types of damage could occur in the future. Due the size of the claim, we have obtained insurance coverage for goods that are shipped direct import to our customers whose shipping terms are FOB shipping point and for goods in transit to our California warehouse however, certain exclusions have been added that may prevent insurance coverage of this type of incident in the future.\nOUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL AND THEREFORE OUR ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND, IN LARGE PART, ON OUR SALES DURING THE RELATIVELY BRIEF HOLIDAY SEASON.\nSales of consumer electronics and toy products in the retail channel are highly seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December in anticipation of the holiday season, which includes Christmas. A substantial majority of our sales occur during our second fiscal quarter ending September 30 and our third fiscal quarter ending December 31. Sales in our second and third quarter, combined, accounted for approximately 81% and 86% of net sales in our fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and, 2021, respectively.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE IN THE KARAOKE PRODUCTS CATEGORY, OUR REVENUES AND NET PROFITABILITY WILL BE REDUCED.\nOur major competitors for karaoke machines and related products are Singsation\u00ae, Singtrix\u00ae, eKids\u00ae, Bonaok, Karaoke USA\u2122, Ion\u00ae Audio, licensed property karaoke products and other consumer electronics companies. We believe that competition for karaoke machines is based primarily on price, product features, reputation, delivery times, and customer support. To the extent that we lower prices to attempt to enhance or retain market share, we may adversely impact our operating margins. Conversely, if we opt not to match competitor\u2019s price reductions we may lose market share, resulting in decreased volume and revenue. To the extent our leading competitors reduce prices on their karaoke machines, we must remain flexible to reduce our prices. If we are forced to reduce our prices, it will result in lower margins and reduced profitability. Because of intense competition in the karaoke industry in the United States during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we expect that the intense pricing pressure in the low end of the market will continue in the karaoke market in the United States in our fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. In addition, we must compete with all the other existing forms of entertainment including, but not limited to: motion pictures, video arcade games, home video games, theme parks, nightclubs, television, prerecorded tapes, CD\u2019s, and DVD\u2019s and streaming video.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP NEW KARAOKE PRODUCTS, OUR REVENUES MAY NOT CONTINUE TO GROW.\nThe karaoke industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and ongoing customer demands for greater performance. In addition, the average selling price of any karaoke machine has historically decreased over its life, and we expect that trend to continue. As a result, our products may not be competitive if we fail to introduce new products or product enhancements that meet evolving customer demands. The development of new products is complex, and we may not be able to complete development in a timely manner. To introduce products on a timely basis, we must:\n\u25cf accurately define and design new products to meet market demand;\n\u25cf design features that continue to differentiate our products from those of our competitors;\n\u25cf transition our products to new manufacturing process technologies;\n\u25cf identify emerging technological trends in our target markets;\n\u25cf anticipate changes in end-user preferences with respect to our customers\u2019 products;\n\u25cf bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices; and\n\u25cf respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by others.\nWe believe that we will need to continue to enhance our karaoke machines and develop new machines to keep pace with competitive and technological developments and to achieve market acceptance for our products. At the same time, we need to identify and develop other products which may be different from karaoke machines.\nOUR PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED FROM CHINA AND ANY DISRUPTION OF SHIPPING COULD PREVENT OR DELAY OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 RECEIPT OF INVENTORY.\nWe rely principally on four contract ocean carriers to ship substantially all of the products that we import to our warehouse facility in Ontario, California. Retailers that take delivery of our products in China rely on a variety of carriers to import those products. Any disruptions in shipping, whether in California or China, caused by labor strikes, other labor disputes, terrorism, and international incidents may prevent or delay our customers\u2019 receipt of inventory. If our customers do not receive their inventory on a timely basis, they may cancel their orders or return products to us. Consequently, our revenues and net income would be reduced and our results of operations adversely affected.\nOUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN THE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, SUBJECTING US TO RISKS COMMON IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. IF THERE IS ANY PROBLEM WITH THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, OUR REVENUES AND NET PROFITABILITY MAY BE REDUCED.\nWe currently use five factories in China to manufacture all of our karaoke products. Our arrangements with these factories are subject to the risks of doing business abroad, such as import duties, trade restrictions, work stoppages, and foreign currency fluctuations, limitations on the repatriation of earnings and political instability, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we have limited control over the manufacturing processes. As a result, any difficulties encountered by our third-party manufacturers that result in product defects, production delays, cost overruns or the inability to fulfill orders on a timely basis could adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flow. Also, since we do not have written agreements with any of these factories, we are subject to additional uncertainty if the factories do not deliver products to us on a timely basis.\nWE DEPEND ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS FOR PARTS FOR OUR KARAOKE MACHINES AND RELATED PRODUCTS, AND IF WE CANNOT OBTAIN SUPPLIES AS NEEDED, OUR OPERATIONS WILL BE SEVERELY DAMAGED.\nOur growth and ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our capability to obtain timely deliveries of karaoke machines and our electronic products. We rely on third party suppliers to produce the parts and materials that are used to manufacture and produce these products. If our suppliers are unable to provide our factories with the parts and supplies, they we will be unable to produce our products. Currently there is a worldwide shortage of electronic chips due to the increased demand for semiconductors and we are currently competing with large companies to obtain these parts and could see production and shipment delays. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to purchase the parts we need at reasonable prices or in a timely fashion. If we are unable to anticipate any shortages of parts and materials in the future, we may experience severe production problems and delivery delays, which would impact our sales.\nWE DEPEND ON THE ABILITY OF OUR SUPPLIERS TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS WITHOUT INFRINGING, MISAPPROPRIATING OF OTHERWISE VIOLATING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS IN MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS.\nWe source our products from a variety of contract manufacturers. We buy finished goods from our suppliers and generally do not source raw materials and parts for manufacturing and assembly into the final product. We rely on our contract manufacturers\u2019 ability to secure injected plastic, wood cabinets, integrated circuits, display panels, speaker drivers, and other components that are necessary for assembly into our final products. While we are not responsible to source raw materials, we rely on these suppliers to have all required licenses or proprietary rights to the materials that are incorporated into the final product. In addition, we rely on the representations of our contract manufacturers that they are using materials and components that meet all necessary legal, safety, and compliance requirements. If our suppliers do not have the proper licenses or rights or are not in compliance with all regulatory requirements, we may be named a party or be subject to claims, including claims of infringement or violating the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties with respect to our products.\nCONSUMER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING MAY AFFECT KARAOKE PURCHASES AND IS AFFECTED BY VARIOUS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CHANGES.\nPurchases of karaoke machines and music are considered discretionary for consumers. Our success will therefore be influenced by a number of economic factors affecting discretionary and consumer spending, such as employment levels, business, interest rates, and taxation rates, all of which are not under our control. Additionally, other extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks or military engagements, which adversely affect the retail environment may restrict consumer spending and thereby adversely affect our sales growth and profitability.\nHIGH INFLATION AND UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND RESULTS.\nUnfavorable global or regional economic conditions may be triggered by numerous developments beyond our control, including inflation, geopolitical events, health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events that trigger economic volatility on a global or regional basis. Those types of unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results. In particular, a significant deterioration in economic conditions, including economic slowdowns or recessions, increased unemployment levels, inflationary pressures or disruptions to credit and capital markets, could lead to decreased consumer confidence and consumer spending more generally, thus reducing consumer demand for our products. For example, in 2021 and continuing into 2022, the United States has experienced a rapid increase in inflation levels of over 8.6%, which is now at a 40-year historic high. Such heightened inflationary levels may negatively impact consumer disposable income and discretionary spending and, in turn, reduce consumer demand for our products and increase our costs.\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, AND IF THESE CUSTOMERS ARE UNABLE TO PAY US, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY WILL BE REDUCED.\nWe sell products to retailers, including national chains, warehouse clubs, department stores, lifestyle merchants, specialty stores, and direct mail catalogs and showrooms. Deterioration in the financial condition of our customers could result in bad debt expense to us and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and future profitability.\nA DISRUPTION IN THE OPERATION OF OUR WAREHOUSE CENTER IN CALIFORNIA COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER MERCHANDISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.\nA significant amount of our merchandise is shipped to our customers from our warehouse located in Ontario, California. Events such as fire or other catastrophic events, any malfunction or disruption of our centralized information systems or shipping problems may result in delays or disruptions in the timely distribution of merchandise to our customers, which could substantially decrease our revenues and profitability.\nWE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES ACCESSING CAPITAL\nWe currently have an Intercreditor Revolving Credit Facility with Crestmark Bank for a $10.0 million facility (decreasing to $5.0 million in off-peak season) on eligible accounts receivable under an evergreen arrangement that terminates upon written notice by the Company and is subject to a termination fee if terminated by the Company anytime other than the annual renewal date of June 11. We also have a $2.5 million facility on eligible inventory with Iron Horse Credit that was to expire on June 11, 2022. However, absent any termination notice given by the Company to IHC, the current financing arrangement automatically renewed for another twelve-month term and is subject to a termination fee if terminated by the Company prior to the twelve-month renewal date. There can be no assurances that we can obtain any new financing or that we will be able to successfully enter into any arrangements upon terms that are acceptable to the Company in the future. Should there be a disruption in the current levels of these markets or a deterioration of our business, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOUR PRODUCTION COSTS MAY INCREASE IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE PURCHASES USING THE CHINESE YUAN INSTEAD OF THE U.S. DOLLAR.\nThe majority of our products are currently manufactured in China. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, the Chinese local currency had no material effect on the Company as all of our purchases are denominated in U.S. currency. However, in the event our purchases are required to be made in Chinese local currency, the Yuan, we will be subject to the risks involved in foreign exchange rates. In the future the value of the Yuan may depend to a large extent on the Chinese government\u2019s policies and China\u2019s domestic and international economic and political developments. As a result, our production costs may increase if we are required to make purchases using the Yuan instead of the U.S. dollar and the value of the Yuan increases over time. Any significant increase in the cost of manufacturing our products would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We sell our product to Canadian customers some of whom require us to invoice them in Canadian Dollars. We are subject to risks involved in the exchange rate between the Canadian and US dollar. However, the exchange rate has been stable during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 and the associated exchange rates did not have a material impact on our financial results. Should the exchange rate between the Canadian and US Dollar become more volatile and sales to Canadian customers increase, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.\nOUR PROFIT MARGIN MAY BE DECREASED DUE TO INCREASED PRICES OF RAW MATERIALS, SHIPPING COSTS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION.\nFluctuation in the price of oil, electronic chip components and shipping costs have and will continue to affect the Company in connection with the sourcing and delivery of raw materials and services. We expect to see increased cost in our finished goods during fiscal year 2023 due to the significant increases in the price of oil, rising inflation, increased cost of trans-oceanic shipping, increased drayage costs, electronic component price increases and increases in the cost of labor related to regulations instituted in China which impact wages related to the cost of production. These issues are common to all companies in the same type of business and if the Company is not able to negotiate lower costs, reduce other expenses, or pass on some or all of these price increases to our customers, our profit margin may be decreased.\nOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE CONTINUED SERVICES OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES.\nWe rely on our executive officers and key employees in the areas of business strategy, marketing, sales, services, and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team or key employees resulting from the hiring or departure of executives or key employees, which could disrupt our business. We do not maintain key-man insurance for any member of our senior management team or any other employee. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a serious adverse effect on our business.\nWE PRIMARILY RELY ON TRADE SECRET PROTECTION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, WHICH MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE.\nWe currently rely on trade secret protection and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and third-parties to protect our confidential and proprietary information. If we do not protect our intellectual property and other confidential information adequately, competitors may be able to use our proprietary technologies and information and thereby erode any competitive advantages they provide us.\nWe will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent these rights are effectively maintained as confidential. We expect to rely primarily on trade secret and contractual protections for our confidential and proprietary information and we have taken security measures we believe are appropriate to protect this information. These measures, however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other confidential information. We seek to protect our proprietary information by, among other things, entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other third parties. These confidentiality agreements may not sufficiently safeguard our trade secrets and other confidential information and may not provide adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret or other proprietary information could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming and the outcome could be unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets or other confidential information could otherwise become known or be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information were disclosed or misappropriated or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed and our business could suffer.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nFUTURE SECURITIES ISSUANCES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DILUTION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND IMPAIR THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nFuture issuances of shares of our common stock could depress the market price of our common stock and result in dilution to existing holders of our common stock. Also, to the extent outstanding options and warrants to purchase our shares of our common stock are exercised or options or other equity-based awards are issued or become vested, there will be further dilution. The amount of dilution could be substantial depending upon the size of the issuances or exercises. Furthermore, we may issue additional equity securities that could have rights senior to those of our common stock.\nBECAUSE CERTAIN OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS CONTROL A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, THEY MAY HAVE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OVER ACTIONS REQUIRING STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL\nAs of the date of this report, Digital Power Lending beneficially owns and BitNile Holdings and Ault may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 1568,849 shares of our common stock or approximately 52.0% of our outstanding shares. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u25cf delaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control;\n\u25cf impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u25cf discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nAS A \u201cCONTROLLED COMPANY\u201d UNDER THE RULES OF THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, WE MAY CHOOSE TO EXEMPT OUR COMPANY FROM CERTAIN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR PUBLIC STOCKHOLDERS.\nSubsequent to March 31, 2022 and as of the date of this report, Digital Power Lending beneficially owns and BitNile Holdings and Ault may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 1,568,849 shares of our common stock or approximately 52.0% of our outstanding shares. Digital Power Lending is a wholly owned subsidiary of BitNile Holdings. Mr. Ault is the Executive Chairman of Bitnile Holdings.\nAs long as BitNile continues to hold more than 50% of the voting power of our Company, we will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined under Nasdaq Marketplace Rules.\nFor so long as we are a controlled company under Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, we are permitted to elect to rely, and may rely, on certain exemptions from corporate governance rules, including:\n\u25cf an exemption from the rule that a majority of our board of directors must be independent directors;\n\u25cf an exemption from the rule that the compensation of our CEO must be determined or recommended solely by independent directors; and\n\u25cf an exemption from the rule that our director nominees must be selected or recommended solely by independent directors.\nAs a result, you may not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to these corporate governance requirements.\nBitNile has indicated it intends to appoint two directors to our Board of Directors. Upon the appointment of the BitNile nominees, our Board of Directors will increase in size to seven directors, of which less than a majority will be \u201cindependent\u201d as defined under Nasdaq Marketplace Rules.\nOUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION ALLOW FOR OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO CREATE NEW SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK WITHOUT FURTHER APPROVAL BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nOur board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of our preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders of preferred stock the right to our assets upon liquidation, or the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock. In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock or to create any series of preferred stock, we may create such series and issue such shares in the future.\nTHE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including:\n\u25cb our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cb operating results below expectations;\n\u25cb loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u25cb industry developments;\n\u25cb economic and other external factors;\n\u25cb changes in government regulations Including tariffs; and\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in its financial results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWE HAVE NOT PAID CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE PAST AND DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE. ANY RETURN ON INVESTMENT MAY BE LIMITED TO THE VALUE OF OUR STOCK.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of cash dividends on our stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay cash dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.", "PERMNO": 88937, "SIC": 3651, "TIC": "SMDM"}
