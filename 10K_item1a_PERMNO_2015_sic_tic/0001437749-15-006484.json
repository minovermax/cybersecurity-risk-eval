Risk Factors.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nWe have a history of losses and may be unable to continue operations unless we can generate sufficient operating income from the sale of our products.\nWe have sustained operating losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we had revenue of $91.3 million, $83.2 million and $127.1 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2014, we had accumulated a deficit of $800.3 million. As evidenced by these financial results, we have not been able to achieve profitability. Continuing losses may exhaust our capital resources and force us to discontinue our operations.\nWe believe we will have sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months based on our current business plan and the assumptions set forth therein. Our current business plan includes a focus on increasing revenue by updating and expanding our product offerings and capitalizing on the known product needs of our existing customers, improving gross margins by significantly leveraging contract manufacturers in Asia and reducing operating costs, primarily through the restructuring initiated in 2013 and continued throughout 2014. In future periods, if we do not adequately execute upon our business plan or if our assumptions or forecasts do not prove to be accurate, we could exhaust our available capital resources, which could require us to seek additional sources of liquidity or to further reduce our expenditures to preserve our cash. Additional sources of liquidity may not be available in an amount or on terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe have yet to achieve positive cash flow, and our ability to generate positive cash flow is uncertain. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital when needed, our business and future prospects will be adversely affected and we could be forced to suspend or discontinue operations.\nOur operations have not generated positive cash flow for any reporting period since our inception, and we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of common and preferred stock and short-term and long-term debt. We had significant revenue growth from 2009 through 2012 and again in 2014, but we had a decrease in revenue in 2013 compared to 2012. Our limited operating history makes an evaluation of our future prospects difficult. The actual amount of funds that we will need to meet our operating needs will be determined by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the timing and volume of sales transactions, the success of our marketing strategy, market acceptance of our products, the success of our research and development efforts, the on-going impact of the transition of our product manufacturing to our contract manufacturers, the costs associated with obtaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, regulatory changes, competition, technological developments in the market, evolving industry standards and the amount of working capital investments we are required to make.\nOur ability to continue to operate until our cash flows from operations turns positive will depend on our ability to continue to raise funds through public or private sales of shares of our capital stock or through debt. Through February 19, 2014, we had an asset-based lending facility (the \u201cWells Fargo ABL\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) that provided us with borrowing capacity calculated based on our accounts receivable and inventory, unrestricted cash held in a Wells Fargo deposit account, and the amount of a Second Lien Letter of Credit Facility (the \u201cAres Letter of Credit Facility\u201d) with Ares Capital Corporation (\u201cAres Capital\u201d). On February 19, 2014, we entered into a $30.5 million five-year term loan (the \u201cMedley Term Loan\u201d) and a two-year delayed draw term loan (as amended from time to time, the \u201cMedley Delayed Draw Loan\u201d) with Medley Capital Corporation (\u201cMedley\u201d) that provided us with borrowing capacity of up to a maximum of $22.5 million. We utilized proceeds from the Medley Term Loan to repay our outstanding obligations under the Wells Fargo ABL and the Ares Letter of Credit Facility. On April 25, 2014, we entered into a three-year asset based revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the \u201cFCC ABL\u201d) with FCC, LLC d/b/a First Capital (\u201cFirst Capital\u201d), which provides us with a maximum borrowing capacity of $22.5 million, subject to certain limitations. We utilized proceeds from the FCC ABL to repay outstanding obligations under the Medley Delayed Draw Loan. As of December 31, 2014, the balance outstanding on the FCC ABL was approximately $6.4 million and we had approximately $8.9 million of additional borrowing capacity.\nIn recent years, we have also raised funds through issuances of our Series H Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries H Preferred Stock\u201d), Series I Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries I Preferred Stock\u201d) and Series J Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries J Preferred Stock\u201d and, collectively with the Series H Preferred Stock and Series I Preferred Stock, the \u201cPreferred Shares\u201d). We have experienced limited access to the capital and credit markets, and it remains uncertain whether we will be able to obtain outside capital when we need it or on terms that would be acceptable to us. We have historically been dependent on affiliates of Pegasus Capital for our liquidity needs because other sources of liquidity have been insufficient or unavailable to meet our needs. If we are able to raise funds by selling additional shares of our Common Stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our Common Stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are unable to obtain sufficient outside capital when needed, our business and future prospects will be adversely affected and we could be forced to suspend or discontinue operations.\nWe may be unable to profitably sell our products in this competitive pricing environment.\nAggressive pricing actions by our competitors may affect our growth prospects and profitability. We may not be able to increase prices to cover rising costs of components and raw materials or we may be limited in our ability to increase prices to improve our margins. Even if component and raw material costs were to decline, lower prices offered by competitors may not allow us to hold prices at their current levels, which could negatively impact both net sales and gross margins.\nOur industry is highly competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively, including against larger lighting manufacturers with greater resources, our prospects for future success will be jeopardized.\nOur industry is highly competitive. We face competition from both traditional lighting technologies provided by numerous vendors as well as from LED-based lighting products provided by a growing roster of industry participants. The LED lighting industry is characterized by rapid technological change, short product lifecycles and frequent new product introductions and a competitive pricing environment. These characteristics increase the need for continual innovation and provide entry points for new competitors as well as opportunities for rapid share shifts.\nCurrently, we view our primary competition to be from large, established companies in the traditional general lighting industry. Certain of these companies also provide, or have undertaken initiatives to develop, LED lighting products as well as other energy efficient lighting products. Additionally, we face competition from a fragmented group of smaller niche or low-cost offshore providers of LED lighting products. We also anticipate that larger LED chip manufacturers, including some of those that currently supply us, may seek to compete with us by introducing more complete retrofit lamps or luminaires. We also expect other large technology players with packaged LED chip technology that are currently focused on other end markets for LEDs, such as backlighting for LCD displays, to increasingly focus on the general illumination market as their existing markets saturate and LED use in general illumination grows. In addition, we may compete in the future with vendors of new technological solutions for energy efficient lighting.\nSome of our current and future competitors are larger companies with greater resources to devote to research and development, manufacturing and marketing, as well as greater brand name recognition. Some of our more diversified competitors could also compete more aggressively with us by subsidizing losses in their LED lighting businesses with profits from other lines of business. Moreover, if one or more of our competitors or suppliers were to merge with one another, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our customer, channel or supplier relationships or our competitive position. Additionally, any loss of a key channel partner, whether to a competitor or otherwise, could severely and rapidly damage our competitive position. To the extent that competition in our markets intensifies, we may be required to reduce our prices in order to remain competitive. If we do not compete effectively, or if we reduce our prices without making commensurate reductions in our costs, our revenue, gross margins and profitability and our future prospects for success, may be harmed.\nIf our preferred stockholders exercise their redemption rights, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and may result in a change of control.\nCommencing on September 25, 2015, RW LSG Holdings LLC, (\u201cRiverwood Holdings\u201d), an affiliate of Riverwood LSG Management Holdings LLC (\u201cRiverwood Management\u201d) and Riverwood Capital Partners L.P. (\u201cRiverwood Capital,\u201d and collectively with Riverwood Holdings, Riverwood Management and their affiliates, \u201cRiverwood\u201d) and Pegasus will have the right to cause us to redeem its shares of Series H Preferred Stock and Series I Preferred Stock, respectively. If either Riverwood or Pegasus elects to cause us to redeem its shares of Series H Preferred Stock or Series I Preferred Stock, all other holders of the applicable series will have the right to redeem their shares of Series H Preferred Stock or Series I Preferred Stock, respectively. In addition, commencing 10 business days after September 25, 2015, each of Portman Limited and affiliates of Zouk Holdings Limited, jointly, has a contractual right to require us to redeem its shares of Series H Preferred Stock. We are also required to redeem the outstanding shares of our Series J Preferred Stock (a) subject to certain limited exceptions, immediately prior to the redemption of the Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock or any other security which ranks junior to, or pari passu with, the Series J Preferred Stock and (b) on November 14, 2019, at the election of the holders of Series J Preferred Stock (the \u201cSpecial Redemption\u201d). Each holder of Preferred Shares would also have the right to require us to redeem such shares upon the uncured material breach of our outstanding obligations under our indebtedness or our uncured breach of the terms of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation governing the Series H Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries H Certificate of Designation\u201d), the Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation governing the Series I Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries I Certificate of Designation\u201d) or the Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation governing the Series J Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries J Certificate of Designation\u201d and, collectively with the Series H Certificate of Designation and Series I Certificate of Designation, the \u201cCertificates of Designation\u201d). In total, our maximum payment obligation in the event of a redemption of all outstanding Preferred Shares was $492.0 million as of March 26, 2015. We would also be required to repay our outstanding obligations under the Medley Term Loan and the FCC ABL prior to any redemption of the Preferred Shares. As of December 31, 2014, the aggregate borrowings outstanding under these loan facilities was $34.2 million.\nAny redemption of the Preferred Shares would be limited to funds legally available therefor under Delaware law. The Certificates of Designation provide that if there is not a sufficient amount of cash or surplus available to redeem the Preferred Shares, then the redemption shall be paid out of the remaining assets of the Company. In addition, the Series J Certificate of Designation provides that we are not permitted or required to redeem any shares of Series J Preferred Stock for so long as such redemption would result in an event of default under our credit facilities. If we do not have sufficient capital available to redeem the Series J Preferred Stock in connection with a Special Redemption of the Series J Preferred Stock, we will be required to issue a non-interest bearing note or notes (payable 180 days after issuance) in the principal amount of the liquidation amount of any shares of Series J Preferred Stock not redeemed by the Company in connection with such Special Redemption, subject to certain limitations imposed by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders. As of December 31, 2014, based solely on a review of our balance sheet, we did not have legally available funds under Delaware law to satisfy a redemption of our Preferred Shares. In addition, based solely on our projected balance sheet as of September 25, 2015, we do not believe that we will have legally available funds on or before September 25, 2015 to satisfy any such redemption.\nWe have a limited amount of revenues and a history of losses, and we may not have sufficient cash to allow us to comply with our redemption obligations. Our ability to redeem the Preferred Shares depends upon our future operating performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which we cannot control. If the cash flow from our operating activities is insufficient, we may take certain actions aimed to enable us to redeem the Preferred Shares, such as delaying or reducing capital expenditures, attempting to obtain financing, selling assets or operations or seeking additional equity capital. Any or all of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to redeem the Preferred Shares. Further, we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner or at all.\nThe Series H Certificate of Designation also provides that upon the occurrence of a Control Event (as defined below), we must take any and all actions required and permitted to fix the size of the Board to a size that would permit Riverwood (as the primary investor of the Series H Preferred Stock) to appoint a majority of the directors to the Board until we satisfy or otherwise cure the obligations giving rise to the Control Event. A \u201cControl Event\u201d occurs if (x) Riverwood exercises its optional redemption right under the Series H Certificate of Designation and we are unable to redeem Riverwood\u2019s Preferred Shares, (y) upon a change of control, we are unable to repurchase Riverwood\u2019s Preferred Shares at a price equal to the liquidation amount or (z) we materially breach our outstanding obligations under our indebtedness or materially breach the terms of the Certificates of Designation. Riverwood\u2019s rights with respect to a Control Event will automatically terminate if it ceases to beneficially own at least 10,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock (or the equivalent number of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of such shares of Series H Preferred Stock).\nOur issuances of Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock and Series J Preferred Stock may limit our ability to raise additional capital and/or take certain corporate action.\nAs of March 26, 2015, we had 246,035.52 shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding, consisting of 113,608.52 shares of our Series H Preferred Stock, 62,365 shares of our Series I Preferred Stock and 70,000 shares of our Series J Preferred Stock. The Certificates of Designation governing the Preferred Shares limit our ability to take certain actions without the consent of Pegasus and Riverwood, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nredeem, reacquire, pay dividends or make other distributions on our securities;\n\u2022\nengage in any recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar transaction;\n\u2022\nincur any indebtedness (A) in excess of that contained in the FCC ABL or Medley Term Loan; or (B) that includes any provision that would limit our ability to redeem any Preferred Shares;\n\u2022\nissue any equity securities, subject to limited exceptions;\n\u2022\nenter into any new agreements or transactions with any affiliates or amend or modify the terms of any such agreements; and\n\u2022\nacquire, license, transfer or sell any property, rights or assets or enter into any joint venture where (A) the aggregate consideration to be paid or received, or (B) the fair market value of the relevant property, rights or assets, exceeds $5.0 million.\nFurther, the Certificates of Designation governing the Series H Preferred Stock and Series I Preferred Stock require us to have consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) that is at least $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and each year thereafter. A breach of the terms of the Preferred Shares could entitle each holder to redeem their Preferred Shares, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe are currently engaged in litigation and may suffer material adverse results.\nOn June 22, 2012, Geveran Investments Limited (\u201cGeveran\u201d), one of our stockholders, filed a lawsuit against us and several other defendants seeking rescission of its $25.0 million investment in the Company, recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs for alleged violations of the Florida securities laws. Geveran alternatively seeks unspecified money damages, as well as recovery of court costs, for alleged common law negligent misrepresentation. On August 28, 2014, the court presiding over the lawsuit granted Geveran\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment with respect to its first cause of action for violation of the Florida securities laws. As of March 30, 2015, this order has not been entered. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, we believe the court\u2019s summary judgment award in favor of Geveran is in error and that we have strong defenses against Geveran\u2019s claims. Once the order is entered, we plan to appeal it and, together with other defendants, post a bond, which should allow us to obtain an automatic stay of enforcement throughout the appeal process. We will vigorously defend our position on appeal. However, in the event that we are not successful on appeal, we could be liable for Geveran\u2019s $25.0 million investment, as well as interest, attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Even if we are successful on appeal, we will have to continue with litigation at the trial court level on the merits of the case. In such case, we may be unable to resolve the dispute in our favor and may ultimately be liable to Geveran for damages. Even if we are eventually successful in defending against Geveran\u2019s claims or entering into a reasonable settlement agreement with Geveran, this litigation could result in substantial costs to us, could be a distraction to management and could harm our financial position.\nWe are also a defendant in an action brought by GE Lighting Solutions LLC (\u201cGE Lighting\u201d) in Federal District Court for the Northern District of Ohio in or about January 2013. GE Lighting asserts a claim of patent infringement against us under U.S Patent No. 6,787,999, entitled LED-Based Modular Lamp, and U.S. Patent No. 6,799,864, entitled High Power LED Power Pack for Spot Module Illumination, and seeks monetary damages and an injunction. We believe that we have strong defenses against GE Lighting\u2019s claims. We have retained counsel, deny liability in connection with this matter and intend to continue to vigorously defend our position against the claims asserted by GE Lighting. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in defending against this action. The outcome, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Even if the outcome is favorable, this litigation could result in substantial costs to us, could be a distraction to management and could harm our financial position.\nIn addition, because we operate in an industry that includes some companies that are much larger, and have significantly greater resources, than the Company, a disagreement with a competitor that is not amicably resolved can result in litigation that, even if a favorable outcome is reached, could result in substantial costs to us, could be a distraction to our management and could harm our financial position.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our stock price.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports, and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could cause investors to lose confidence in our operating results, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and on the price of our common stock. Because of our status as a smaller reporting company registrant as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements has not been required to attest to, and report on, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nDuring the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures for the year ended December 31, 2014, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in reaching a reasonable level of assurance of achieving management\u2019s desired controls and procedures objectives in our internal control over financial reporting. We believe that many of the observed material weaknesses resulted from the loss of certain key accounting and finance personnel and the transition of certain duties to personnel less familiar with the roles and responsibilities.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2014, the following are among the key actions taken to our internal controls, which we believe have remediated the identified weaknesses:\n\u25cf\nWe have improved the controls over the spreadsheet used in the inventory valuation and enhanced the training of the personnel responsible for preparing and reviewing the spreadsheet; and\n\u25cf\nWe have implemented a reconciliation and confirmation process for our in-transit inventory on a monthly basis, as well as provided additional training of the personnel responsible for preparing and reviewing these transactions.\nAdditional measures may be necessary to complete the remediation of the weaknesses identified in our internal controls. We plan to continue to assess our internal controls and procedures and intend to take further action as necessary or appropriate to address any other weaknesses we identify. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls and procedures is a continuous effort, however, that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and economic and regulatory environments. Additionally, we or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify additional weaknesses. The steps we have taken, or may subsequently take, may not be sufficient to fully remediate the material weakness identified or ensure that our internal controls are effective. Complying with these requirements may place a strain on our personnel, information technology systems and resources and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. We may need to hire, at a material expense to us, additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge as part of the remediation of our material weakness or otherwise.\nThe LED lighting industry is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, product obsolescence, price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and fluctuations in supply and demand. If we fail to anticipate and adapt to these changes and fluctuations, our sales, gross margins and profitability will be adversely affected.\nIn the LED lighting industry, rapid technological changes and short product life cycles often lead to price erosion and product obsolescence. Companies within the LED lighting industry are continuously developing new products with heightened performance and functionality, putting pricing pressure on existing products. Further, the industry has experienced significant fluctuations, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, product cycles and changes in general economic conditions. These fluctuations have been characterized by lower product demand, production overcapacity, higher inventory levels and increased pricing pressure. Our failure to accurately anticipate the introduction of new technologies or adapt to fluctuations in the industry can, as it has in the past, lead to our having significant amounts of obsolete inventory that can only be sold at substantially lower prices and profit margins than anticipated. Pricing pressure and obsolescence also cause the stated value of our inventory to decline. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded an inventory write-down of $4.7 million, $11.4 million and $15.8 million, respectively, and a provision for expected losses on non-cancellable purchase commitments of $507,000, $2.3 million and $5.6 million, respectively. In addition, if we are unable to develop planned new technologies or if the transition of our manufacturing operations are unsuccessful, we may be unable to compete effectively due to our failure to offer products most demanded by the marketplace. If any of these failures occur, our sales, gross margins and profitability will be adversely affected.\nIf our developed technology or technology under development does not achieve market acceptance, prospects for our growth and profitability would be limited.\nOur future success depends on continued market acceptance of our LED technology and the technology currently under development. Although adoption of LED lighting continues to grow, adoption of LED lighting products for general illumination is in its early stages, is still limited and faces significant challenges. Potential customers may be reluctant to adopt LED lighting products as an alternative to traditional lighting technology because of its higher initial cost or perceived risks relating to its novelty, reliability, usefulness, light quality and cost-effectiveness when compared to other established lighting sources available in the market. Changes in economic and market conditions may also affect the marketability of some traditional lighting technologies such as declining energy prices in certain regions or countries may favor existing lighting technologies that are less energy efficient, reducing the rate of adoption for LED lighting products in those areas. Moreover, if existing sources of light other than LED lighting products achieve or maintain greater market adoption, or if new sources of light are developed, our current products and technologies could become less competitive or obsolete. Even if LED lighting products continue to achieve performance improvements and cost reductions, limited customer awareness of the benefits of LED lighting products, lack of widely accepted standards governing LED lighting products and customer unwillingness to adopt LED lighting products in favor of entrenched solutions could significantly limit the demand for LED lighting products and adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively develop, manage and expand our sales and distribution channels for our products, our operating results may suffer.\nWe sell a substantial portion of our products to retailers and OEMs who then sell our products on a co-branded or private label basis. Orders from our retail and OEM customers are dependent upon their internal target inventory levels for our products which can vary significantly based upon current and projected market cycles and other factors over which we typically have very little, if any, control. We rely on these retailers and OEMs to develop and expand the customer base for our products and to accurately forecast demand from their customers. If they are not successful in either task, our growth and profitability may be adversely impacted.\nWe rely on our relationship with The Home Depot and the loss of this material relationship or any other significant relationship would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our future growth prospects and our ability to distribute our products.\nWe form business relationships and strategic alliances with retailers and other lighting companies to market our products, generally under private or co-branded labels. In certain cases, such relationships are important to our introduction of new products and services, and we may not be able to successfully collaborate or achieve expected synergies with these retailers or lighting companies. We do not control these retailers or lighting companies and they may make decisions regarding their business undertakings with us that may be contrary to our interests, or may terminate their relationships with us altogether. In addition, if these retailers or lighting companies change their business strategies, for example due to business volume fluctuations, mergers and acquisitions and/or performance issues, fail to pay or terminate the relationship altogether, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, The Home Depot accounted for 80%, 55% and 48% of our net sales, respectively. While we anticipate The Home Depot will remain a significant customer in 2015, our contractual commitment with The Home Depot is not long term in nature. Our Strategic Purchasing Agreement with The Home Depot does not expire until July 2016, but The Home Depot may terminate the Strategic Purchasing Agreement at any time for any reason upon 180 days written notice to us. Following expiration of the initial term in July 2016, The Home Depot may extend the Strategic Purchasing Agreement for two additional one-year renewal terms. A loss of The Home Depot as a customer or a significant decline in their purchases or their failure to pay us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our future growth prospects and our ability to distribute our products.\nThe Home Depot has required, and we expect will continue to require, increased service and order accommodations as well as incremental promotional investments. We may face increased expenses to meet these demands, which would reduce our margins. In addition, we generally have little or no influence on The Home Depot\u2019s promotional or pricing policies, which may impact our sales volume to it. In addition, our Strategic Purchasing Agreement with The Home Depot does not require it to purchase a minimum quantity of products from us. We issued a Warrant to The Home Depot that included incentive-based vesting conditions through 2015 based on annual 20% increases in product purchases made under the Strategic Purchasing Agreement. For 2011, 2012 and 2014, the 20% volume increase was reached and The Home Depot vested in warrants to purchase a total of 5,008,176 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.20 per share. However, The Home Depot did not purchase a sufficient quantity of products from us to achieve the incentive-based vesting condition for 2013. As of December 31, 2014, the 1,669,392 warrants that vested in 2011 expired unexercised.\nIf we do not successfully manage our network of distributors and independent sales representatives, we may not be able to increase sales to meet growth expectations.\nOur growth and future financial performance will depend on our ability to maintain and exploit our internal sales and service organization, and to substantially increase the scope of our distribution and sales network, both domestically and internationally. We may not be able to negotiate acceptable relationships in the future and cannot predict whether current or future relationships will be successful. We may face intense competition for personnel and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract, assimilate or retain additional qualified business development and sales personnel on a timely basis.\nSome of these relationships have not been formalized in a detailed contract, and may be subject to termination at any time. The agreements that are formalized in a contract are generally short-term, not exclusive, and can be cancelled by these sales channels without significant financial consequence. In addition, these parties provide technical sales support to end-users. We cannot control how these sales channels perform and cannot be certain that we or end-users will be satisfied by their performance. If these distributors and agents significantly change their terms with us, or change their historical pattern of ordering products from us, there could be a significant impact on our revenue and profits.\nOur products may contain defects that could reduce sales, result in costs associated with the recall of or warranty obligations associated with those items and result in claims against us.\nThe manufacture of our products involves highly complex processes. Despite testing by us, our contract manufacturers and our customers, defects have been and could be found in our existing or future products. These defects may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair costs. The costs associated with a recall may divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with customers and our reputation in the marketplace. We generally provide a five year warranty on our products, and such warranty may require us to repair, replace or reimburse the purchaser for the purchase price of the product, at our discretion. Moreover, even if our products meet standard specifications, our customers may attempt to use our products in applications they were not designed for or in products that were not designed or manufactured properly, resulting in product failures and creating customer dissatisfaction. These problems could result in, among other things, a delay in the recognition or loss of revenue, loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $4.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in warranty expense primarily related to an increase in the number of products returned under our standard warranty and the estimated expenses related to failure rates on two of our replacement lamp product lines sold in 2011 and 2012. If our products experience failure rates in excess of our estimates, we may continue to incur increased warranty expenses in the future.\nDefects, integration issues or other performance problems in our products could also result in personal injury or financial or other damages to our customers for which they might seek legal recourse against us. We may be the target of product liability lawsuits and could suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us if the use of our products at issue is determined to have caused injury. A significant product recall or product liability case could also adversely affect our results of operations and result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation and a loss of customer confidence in our products.\nIf we are unable to increase production capacity for our products with our contract manufacturers in a cost effective and timely manner, we may incur delays in shipment and our revenue and reputation in the marketplace could be harmed.\nAn important part of our business plan is the expansion of production capacity for our products. In order to fulfill anticipated demand for our products, we invest in capacity in advance of actual customer orders, typically based on preliminary, non-binding indications of future demand. As customer demand for our products changes, we must be able to adjust our production capacity to meet demand while keeping costs down. Uncertainty is inherent within our facility and capacity expansion, and unforeseen circumstances could offset the anticipated benefits, disrupt our ability to provide products to our customers and impact product quality.\nOur ability to successfully increase or obtain production capacity in a cost effective and timely manner will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to sustain relationships with key contract manufacturers without disruption and the ability of contract manufacturers to allocate more of their existing capacity to us or their ability to add new capacity quickly;\n\u2022\nthe ability of any future contract manufacturers to successfully implement our manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nthe availability of critical components and subsystems used in the manufacture of our products; and\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively establish adequate management information systems, financial controls and supply chain management and quality control procedures.\nIf we are unable to increase production capacity for our products in a cost effective and timely manner while maintaining adequate quality, we may incur delays in shipment or be unable to meet increased demand for our products, which could harm our revenue and operating margins and damage our reputation and our relationships with current and prospective customers.\nWe utilize contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products and any disruption in these relationships may cause us to fail to meet our customers\u2019 demands and may damage our customer relationships and adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products and provide the necessary facilities and labor to manufacture these products, which are primarily high volume products and components that we intend to distribute to customers in North America. Our reliance on contract manufacturers involve certain risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nlack of direct control over production capacity and delivery schedules;\n\u2022\nrisk of equipment failures, natural disasters, civil unrest, industrial accidents, power outages and other business interruptions;\n\u2022\nlack of direct control over quality assurance and manufacturing yield; and\n\u2022\nrisk of loss of inventory while in transit.\nIf our current contract manufacturers or any other contract manufacturers we may engage in the future were to terminate their arrangement with us or fail to provide the required capacity and quality on a timely basis, we would experience delays in the manufacture and shipment of our products until alternative manufacturing services could be contracted. Any significant shortages or interruption may cause us to be unable to timely deliver sufficient quantities of our products to satisfy our contractual obligations and particular revenue expectations. Moreover, even if we timely locate substitute products, if their price materially exceeds the original expected cost of such products, our margins and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, to qualify new contract manufacturers, familiarize them with our products, quality standards and other requirements and commence volume production may be a costly and time-consuming process. If we are required or choose to change contract manufacturers for any reason, our revenue, gross margins and customer relationships could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not properly anticipate the need for our products, we may be unable to meet the demands of our customers and end-users, which could reduce our competitiveness, cause a decline in our market share and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe lighting industry is subject to significant fluctuations in the availability of raw materials, components and subsystems. Our contract manufacturers and we depend on our suppliers for certain standard electronic components as well as custom components critical to the manufacture of our lighting devices. The principal raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products are packaged LEDs and printed circuit boards, MOSFETS, magnetic and standard electrical components such as capacitors, resistors and diodes, wire, plastics for optical systems and aluminum for housings and heat sinks. From time to time, packaged LEDs and electronic components have been in short supply due to demand and production constraints. If we do not accurately forecast demand for our products, we or our contract manufacturers may not be able to find an adequate alternative source of supply at an acceptable cost. Any significant interruption in the supply of these raw materials, components and subsystems or our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to unpredictable sales cycles in certain of the markets into which we sell our products, which may lead to volatility in our stock price.\nThe size and timing of our revenue from sales to our customers is difficult to predict and is market dependent. Our revenue in each period may also vary significantly as a result of purchases, or lack thereof, by The Home Depot or other significant customers. Because most of our operating and capital expenses are incurred based on the estimated number of product purchases and their timing, they are difficult to adjust in the short term. As a result, if our revenue falls below our expectations or is delayed in any period, we may not be able to proportionately reduce our operating expenses or manufacturing costs for that period. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.\nOur debt obligations contain restrictions that impact our business and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nOn February 19, 2014, we entered into the Medley Term Loan and Medley Delayed Draw Loan, and we utilized proceeds from the Medley Term Loan to repay our outstanding obligations under the Wells Fargo ABL and the Ares Letter of Credit Facility. On April 25, 2014, we entered into the FCC ABL which provides us with a maximum borrowing capacity of $22.5 million, which capacity is limited by a borrowing base equal to (i) the sum of (A) 85% of the Company\u2019s eligible accounts receivable and (B) the lesser of (a) $10 million and (b) the sum of (x) the lesser of (1) 65% of the dollar value of certain eligible inventory and (2) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of such eligible inventory, (y) 65% of certain other inventory and (z) the lesser of (1) $4.5 million and (2) the lesser of 65% of the dollar value or 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory that is in-transit, minus (ii) the sum of reserves established by First Capital and the amount of our outstanding letter of credit obligations. We utilized proceeds from the FCC ABL to repay outstanding obligations under the Medley Delayed Draw Loan. As of December 31, 2014, the balance outstanding on the FCC ABL was approximately $6.4 million and we had approximately $8.9 million of additional borrowing capacity.\nBorrowings under the Medley Term Loan and FCC ABL are secured by substantially all of our assets and our material wholly owned subsidiaries (subject to certain permitted liens) and may be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. We may replace the FCC ABL facility with a replacement revolving facility, on a secured first priority basis, without penalty or premium, subject to the negotiation of loan documents and an intercreditor agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to FCC and Medley.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments under the Medley Term Loan and FCC ABL could result in a default under these facilities. Further, we are required under our credit facilities to maintain a certain minimum EBITDA and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00. Failure to comply with these or any other requirements of our indebtedness could result in a default. Any default that is not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the obligations under these facilities, an increase in the applicable interest rate under these facilities and a requirement that our subsidiaries that have guaranteed these facilities pay the obligations in full, and would permit our lenders to exercise remedies with respect to all of the collateral securing these facilities, including substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors\u2019 assets. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, the covenants in such agreements or future debt agreements may restrict the conduct of our business, which could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be beneficial to the business.\nIf we are unable to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to commercialize our products could be substantially limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had filed 353 U.S. patent applications covering various inventions related to the design and manufacture of LED lighting technology. From these applications, 230 U.S. patents had been issued, 122 were pending approval and 22 were no longer active. When we believe it is appropriate and cost effective, we make corresponding international, regional or national filings to pursue patent protection in other parts of the world. Our patent applications may not be granted. Because patents involve complex legal, technical and factual questions, the issuance, scope, validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our patent rights. Others may challenge our patents and, as a result, our patents could be narrowed or invalidated. In some cases, we may rely on confidentiality agreements or trade secret protections to protect our proprietary technology. Such agreements, however, may not be honored and particular elements of our proprietary technology may not qualify as protectable trade secrets under applicable law. In addition, others may independently develop similar or superior technology, and in the absence of applicable prior patents, we would have no recourse against them.\nOur business may be impaired by claims that we, or our customers, infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. These traits have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation. In addition, we may inadvertently infringe on patents or rights owned by others and licenses might not be available to us on reasonable or acceptable terms or at all. Litigation to determine the validity of patents or claims by third parties of infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights could result in significant legal expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management, even if the litigation results in a determination favorable to us. Third parties have and may in the future attempt to assert infringement claims against us, or our customers, with respect to our products. In the event of an adverse result in such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages; stop the manufacture, use and sale of products found to be infringing; incur asset impairment charges; discontinue the use of processes found to be infringing; expend significant resources to develop non-infringing products or processes; or obtain a license to use third party technology and whether or not the result is adverse to us, we may have to indemnify our customers if they were brought into the litigation.\nCertification and compliance are important to the sale and adoption of our lighting products, and failure to obtain such certification or compliance would harm our business.\nWe are required to comply with certain legal requirements governing the materials used in our products. Although we are not aware of any efforts to amend existing legal requirements or implement new legal requirements in a manner with which we cannot comply, our revenue might be materially harmed if such changes were to occur. Moreover, although not legally required to do so, we strive to obtain certification for substantially all of our products. In the United States, we seek, and to date have obtained, certification for substantially all of our products from UL. We design our products to be UL/cUL and Federal Communications Commission compliant. We have also obtained ENERGY STAR qualification for 70 of the products that we were producing as of December 31, 2014. Although we believe that our broad knowledge and experience with electrical codes and safety standards have facilitated certification approvals, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain any such certifications for our new products or that, if certification standards are amended, we will be able to maintain any such certifications for our existing products, especially since virtually all existing codes and standards were not created with LED lighting products in mind. The failure to obtain such certifications or compliance could harm our business.\nThe reduction or elimination of investments in, or incentives to adopt, LED lighting or the elimination of, or changes in, policies, incentives or rebates in certain states or countries that encourage the use of LEDs over some traditional lighting technologies could cause the growth in demand for our products to slow, which could materially and adversely affect our revenue, profits and margins.\nWe believe the near-term growth of the LED market will be accelerated by government policies in certain countries that either directly promote the use of LEDs or discourage the use of some traditional lighting technologies. Today, the upfront cost of LED lighting exceeds the upfront cost for some traditional lighting technologies that provide similar lumen output in many applications. However, some governments around the world have used policy initiatives to accelerate the development and adoption of LED lighting and other non-traditional lighting technologies that are seen as more environmentally friendly compared to some traditional lighting technologies. Reductions in (including as a result of any budgetary constraints), or the elimination of, government investment and favorable energy policies could result in decreased demand for our products and decrease our revenue, profits and margins. Further, if our products fail to qualify for any financial incentives or rebates provided by governmental agencies or utilities for which our competitors\u2019 products qualify, such programs may diminish or eliminate our ability to compete by offering products at lower prices than our competitors.\nChanges in the mix of products we sell during a period could have an impact on our results of operations.\nOur profitability from period-to-period may vary significantly due to the mix of products that we sell in different periods. As we expand our product offerings we expect to sell more retrofit lamps and luminaires into additional target markets. These products are likely to have different cost profiles and will be sold into markets governed by different business dynamics. Consequently, sales of individual products may not necessarily be consistent across periods, which could affect product mix and cause gross and operating profits to vary significantly. Given the potentially large size of purchase orders for our products, particularly in the infrastructure market, the loss of or delay in the signing of a customer order could significantly reduce our revenue in any period. In addition, we spend substantial amounts of time and money on our efforts to educate our customers about the use and benefits of our products, including their technical and performance characteristics, and these investments may not produce any sales within expected time frames or at all.\nWe rely upon key members of our management team and other key personnel and a loss of key personnel could prevent or significantly delay the achievement of our goals.\nOur success will depend to a large extent on the abilities and continued services of key members of our management team. The loss of key members of our management team or other key personnel could prevent or significantly delay the implementation of our business plan, research and development and marketing efforts. Our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel including a new Chief Financial Officer and our efforts to obtain or retain such personnel may not be successful.\nThe operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business.\nMost of our products are manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers in foreign countries. During 2014, approximately 85% of our products were manufactured internationally, as compared to 60% in 2013 and 95% in 2012. As a result of our international manufacturing, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022 political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured;\n\u2022 currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\ndisruptions or delays in shipments; and\n\u2022\nchanges in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers and suppliers are located.\nThese risks could negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials and could increase our cost of doing business generally. In the event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, certain of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or other import limitations that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other markets. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new import limitations, duties, anti-dumping penalties or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur international operations are subject to legal, political and economic risks.\nOur financial condition, operating results and future growth could be significantly affected by risks associated with our international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies, differing business cultures, foreign regulations that may conflict with domestic regulations, intellectual property protection and trade secret risks, differing contracting process including the ability to enforce agreements, increased dependence on foreign manufacturers, shippers and distributors and import and export restrictions and tariffs.\nCompliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), foreign exchange controls, anti-money laundering and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, and any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation. We have not implemented formal policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition or operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur Common Stock has been thinly traded and an active trading market may not develop.\nThe trading volume of our Common Stock has historically been low, partially because we are not listed on an exchange and our Common Stock is only traded on the over-the-counter bulletin board (the \u201cOTC Bulletin Board\u201d). In addition, our public float has been further limited due to the fact that the vast majority of our outstanding Common Stock has historically been beneficially owned by affiliates of Pegasus Capital. Until we initiate a public offering of our Common Stock or are approved for listing on a national exchange, a more active trading market for our Common Stock may not develop, or if developed, may not continue, and a holder of any of our securities may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our Common Stock.\nWe are controlled by Pegasus Capital, whose interests in our business may be different from yours.\nAffiliates of Pegasus Capital beneficially owned approximately 87.9% of our Common Stock as of March 26, 2015. As a result of this ownership, Pegasus Capital has a controlling influence on our affairs and its voting power constitutes a quorum of our stockholders voting on any matter requiring the approval of our stockholders. Such matters include the nomination and election of directors, the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock or payment of dividends, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and approval of mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. Pegasus Capital may cause corporate actions to be taken even if the interests of Pegasus Capital conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nIf we applied and our shares were approved for listing on a national stock exchange, we would likely elect to be considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d which would exempt us from certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that a majority of our board of directors meet the specified standards of independence and the exemption from the requirement that we have a compensation and governance committee made up entirely of directors who meet such independence standards. Such independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standard are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. It is possible that the interests of Pegasus Capital may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders, including you.\nBecause our stock price is volatile, it can be difficult for stockholders to predict the value of our shares at any given time.\nThe price of our Common Stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, which makes it difficult for stockholders to assess or predict the value of their shares. A number of factors may affect the market price of our Common Stock, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and government regulations;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our proprietary rights;\n\u2022\npublic perception relating to the commercial value or reliability of any of our lighting products;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our Common Stock or issues of other equity securities convertible into or exercisable for the purchase of Common Stock;\n\u2022\nour involvement in litigation;\n\u2022\nthe acquisition or divestiture by Pegasus Capital or its affiliates of part or all of its holdings; and\n\u2022\ngeneral stock market conditions.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Common Stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our Common Stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We have a history of losses and currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. In addition, the terms of the Medley Term Loan and the FCC ABL restrict our ability to pay cash dividends and any future credit facilities or loan agreements may further restrict our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be your sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage a takeover.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management, engage in proxy contests and effect changes in control. The provisions of our charter documents include:\n\u2022\nprocedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals;\n\u2022\nthe inability of less than a majority of our stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to create new directorships and to fill any vacancies on the board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to amend our bylaws without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval upon the terms and conditions and with the rights, privileges and preferences as our board of directors may determine.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in Section 203. These provisions, alone or together, could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our Common Stock may depress the price of shares of our Common Stock.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities. We may issue shares of our Common Stock or other securities from time to time to raise capital to fund our operating expenses pursuant to the exercise of outstanding stock options or warrants or as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. If any such issuance, acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our Common Stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our Common Stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Common Stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our Common Stock will have on the market price of our Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock (including shares of our Common Stock issued in connection with an acquisition or by Pegasus Capital or its affiliates), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Common Stock.\nSecurities analysts may not provide coverage of our Common Stock or may issue negative reports, which may have a negative impact on the market price of our Common Stock.\nSecurities analysts have not historically provided research coverage of our Common Stock and may elect not to do so in the future. If securities analysts do not cover our Common Stock, the lack of research coverage may cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. The trading market for our Common Stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about our business. If one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline substantially. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, rules mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and a global settlement reached in 2003 between the SEC, other regulatory agencies and a number of investment banks have led to a number of fundamental changes in how analysts are reviewed and compensated. In particular, many investment banking firms are required to contract with independent financial analysts for their stock research. It may be difficult for companies such as ours, with smaller market capitalizations, to attract independent financial analysts that will cover our Common Stock. This could have a negative effect on the market price of our stock.", "PERMNO": 77525, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "LSCG"}
