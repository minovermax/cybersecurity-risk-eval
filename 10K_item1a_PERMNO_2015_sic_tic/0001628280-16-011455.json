{"cik": "1441236", "company": "Clearwater Paper Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, and as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIncreases in tissue supply could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOver the past few years, several new or refurbished TAD paper machines have been completed or announced by our competitors, including private label competitors, that will result in a substantial increase in the supply of TAD tissue in the North American market. Additionally, several new or refurbished conventional tissue machines have been installed or announced, including as a result of foreign competitors increasing their presence and operations in North America. The increase in supply of TAD products, as well as the effects of that increased supply in displacing existing conventional tissue product sales, and the increase in conventional tissue production could each have a material adverse effect on the price of TAD tissue products and on the market demand and price for conventional tissue products, which will continue to represent a majority of our total production for the foreseeable future.\nUnited States and global economic conditions could have adverse effects on the demand for our products and financial results.\nU.S. and global economic conditions have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business and financial results. Recessed global economic conditions and a strong U.S. dollar can affect our business in a number of ways, including causing declines in global demand for consumer tissue and paperboard, which increases the likelihood or the pace of foreign manufacturers entering into or increasing sales into the U.S. market.\nIncreased competition and supply from foreign manufacturers could have adverse effects on the demand for our products and financial results.\nForeign manufacturers in Asia and Europe are currently increasing, and are expected to continue to increase, their paper production capabilities, particularly with respect to paperboard. This, in turn, may result in increased competition in the North American paper markets from direct sales by foreign competitors into these markets and/or increased competition in the U.S. as domestic manufacturers seek increased U.S. sales to offset displaced overseas sales caused by increased sales by foreign suppliers into Asia and European markets. An increased supply of foreign paper products could cause us to lower our prices or lose sales to competitors, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetitors' branded products and private label products could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur consumer products compete with well-known, branded products, as well as other private label products. Inherent risks include new product offerings by competitors, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels price competition from companies that may have greater financial resources than we do, and whether our products will receive direct and retail customer acceptance. If we are unable to offer our existing customers, or new customers, tissue products comparable to branded products or private label products in terms of quality and/or price, we may lose business or we may not be able to grow our existing business and be forced to sell lower-margin products, all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from, or changes in prices in regards to, any of our large customers could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe derive a substantial amount of revenues from a concentrated group of customers. For example, our top 10 consumer products customers in 2015 accounted for approximately 70% of our total consumer products net sales. Our top 10 paperboard customers in 2015 accounted for approximately 50% of our total paperboard net sales. If we lose any of these customers or a substantial portion of their business or if the terms of our relationship with any of them becomes less favorable to us, our net sales would decline, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have experienced increased price and promotion competition for our consumer products customers, particularly in regards to TAD products, and this competition has decreased our gross margins and adversely affected our financial condition. Some of our customers have the capability to produce the parent rolls or products that they purchase from us. While our Pulp and Paperboard segment sells its products to a large number of customers, our top 10 paperboard customers have historically accounted for approximately half of our sales.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with many of our customers, including some of our largest customers, that ensure a continuing level of business from them. In addition, our agreements with our customers are not exclusive and generally do not contain minimum volume purchase commitments. Our relationship with our large customers will depend on our\nability to continue to meet their needs for quality products and services at competitive prices. If we lose one or more of these customers or if we experience a significant decline in the level of purchases by any of them, we may not be able to quickly replace the lost business volume and our operating results and business could be harmed. In addition, our focus on these large accounts could affect our ability to serve our smaller accounts, particularly when product supply is tight and we are not able to fully satisfy orders for these smaller accounts.\nWe have in the past announced and implemented price increases. These or other price increases may not be accepted in whole or part and could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in sales.\nDisruptions in our transportation services or increases in our transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nShipments of products and raw materials may be delayed or disrupted due to weather conditions, labor shortages or strikes, regulatory actions or other events. If any transportation providers are unavailable or fail to deliver our products in a timely manner, we may incur increased costs. If any transportation providers are unavailable or fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture products on a timely basis.\nOur business, particularly our consumer products business, is dependent on transportation services to deliver our products to our customers and to deliver raw materials to us. In 2015, our transportation costs were 12.2% of our cost of sales. The costs of these transportation services are influenced by the factors described above as well as fuel prices, which are affected by geopolitical and economic events. We have not been in the past, and may not be in the future, able to pass along part or all of any fuel price increases to customers. If we are unable to increase our prices as a result of increased fuel or transportation costs, our gross margins may be materially adversely affected.\nWe incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and any interruption in the operations of our facilities may harm our operating performance.\nWe regularly incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and facilities. The machines and equipment that we use to produce our products are complex, have many parts and some are run on a continuous basis. We must perform routine maintenance on our equipment and will have to periodically replace a variety of parts such as motors, pumps, pipes and electrical parts. In addition, our pulp and paperboard facilities require periodic shutdowns to perform major maintenance. These scheduled shutdowns of facilities result in decreased sales and increased costs in the periods in which a shutdown occurs and could result in unexpected operational issues in future periods as a result of changes to equipment and operational and mechanical processes made during the shutdown period. We had two scheduled major maintenance shutdowns in 2015 - one during the first quarter at our Lewiston, Idaho pulp and paperboard facility and one during the second quarter at our Cypress Bend, Arkansas facility.\nUnexpected production disruptions could cause us to shut down or curtail operations at any of our facilities. For example, we experienced ongoing operational issues through the first quarter of 2015 with the recovery furnace at our Cypress Bend, Arkansas facility associated with a 2013 upgrade project and certain of our facilities have had to curtail operations as the result of an electrical malfunction and a fire in previous years. Disruptions could occur due to any number of circumstances, including prolonged power outages, mechanical or process failures, shortages of raw materials, natural catastrophes, disruptions in the availability of transportation, labor disputes, terrorism, changes in or non-compliance with environmental or safety laws and the lack of availability of services from any of our facilities' key suppliers. Any facility shutdowns may be followed by prolonged startup periods, regardless of the reason for the shutdown. Those startup periods could range from several days to several weeks, depending on the reason for the shutdown and other factors. Any prolonged disruption in operations at any of our facilities could cause significant lost production, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations, and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our financial condition.\nWe use information technology, or IT, systems in various aspects of our operations, including enterprise resource planning, or ERP, management of inventories and customer sales. Some of these systems have been in place for long periods of time. We have different legacy IT systems that we are continuing to integrate, including the implementation of a single company-wide ERP system. If one of these systems or the ERP implementation was to fail or cause operational or reporting interruptions, or if we decide to change these systems or hire outside parties to provide these systems, we may suffer disruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing new systems.\nWe depend on external sources of wood pulp and wood fiber, which subjects our business and results of operations to potentially significant fluctuations in the price of market pulp and wood fiber.\nOur Consumer Products segment sources a significant portion of its wood pulp requirements from external suppliers, which exposes us to price fluctuation. In 2015, it sourced approximately 56% of its pulp requirements externally, comprising approximately 12.3% of our cost of sales.\nPulp prices can, and have, changed significantly from one period to the next. The volatility of pulp prices can adversely affect our earnings if we are unable to pass cost increases on to our customers or if the timing of any price increases for our products significantly trails the increases in pulp prices. We have not hedged these risks.\nWood fiber is the principal raw material used to create wood pulp, which in turn is used to manufacture our pulp and paperboard products and consumer products. In 2015, our wood fiber costs were 9.7% of our cost of sales. Much of the wood fiber we use in our pulp manufacturing process in Lewiston, Idaho, is the by-product of sawmill operations. As a result, the price of these residual wood fibers is affected by operating levels in the lumber industry. The significant reduction in home building over the past several years resulted in the closure or curtailment of operations at many sawmills. The price of wood fiber is expected to remain volatile until the housing market recovers and sawmill operations increase. Additionally, the supply and price of wood fiber can also be negatively affected by weather and other events. For example, our Arkansas pulp and paperboard facility relies on whole log chips for a significant portion of its wood fiber, and in 2015 this facility experienced increases in the costs for that wood fiber due to extremely wet weather conditions in the Southeastern U.S. that limited accessibility and availability.\nThe effects on market prices for wood fiber resulting from various governmental programs involving tax credits or payments related to biomass and other renewable energy projects are uncertain and could result in a reduction in the supply of wood fiber available for our pulp and paperboard manufacturing operations. Additionally, wood pellet facilities or fluff pulp facilities, such as a fluff pulp facility recently announced in Arkansas, can increase demand and prices for wood fiber. If we and our pulp suppliers are unable to obtain wood fiber at favorable prices or at all, our costs will increase and financial results, operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nCyclical industry conditions have in the past affected and may continue to adversely affect the operating results and cash flows of our pulp and paperboard business.\nOur pulp and paperboard business has historically been affected by cyclical market conditions. We may be unable to sustain pricing in the face of weaker demand, and weaker demand may in turn cause us to take production downtime. In addition to lost revenue from lower shipment volumes, production downtime causes unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production levels. Our results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected in a period of prolonged and significant market weakness. We are not able to predict market conditions or our ability to sustain pricing and production levels during periods of weak demand.\nOur business and financial performance may be harmed by future labor disruptions.\nAs of December 31, 2015, 52% of our full-time employees are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements. As these agreements expire, we may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacement agreements on terms acceptable to us. In 2016, three collective bargaining agreements are scheduled to expire and will be subject to negotiation. Any failure to reach an agreement with one of the unions may result in strikes, lockouts, work slowdowns, stoppages or other labor actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nThe cost of chemicals and energy needed for our manufacturing processes significantly affects our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use a variety of chemicals in our manufacturing processes, including petroleum-based polyethylene and certain petroleum-based latex chemicals. In 2015, our chemical costs were 11.9% of our cost of sales. Prices for these chemicals have been and are expected to remain volatile. In addition, chemical suppliers that use petroleum-based products in the manufacture of their chemicals may, due to supply shortages and cost increases, ration the amount of chemicals available to us, and therefore we may not be able to obtain at favorable prices the chemicals we need to operate our business, if we are able to obtain them at all.\nOur manufacturing operations utilize large amounts of electricity and natural gas and our energy requirements, particularly natural gas, have increased significantly as a result of operations at our North Carolina facility. In 2015, our energy costs were 7.0% of our cost of sales. Energy prices have fluctuated widely over the past decade, which in turn affects our cost of sales. We purchase on the open market a substantial portion of the natural gas necessary to produce our products, and, as a result, the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand, geopolitical events, government regulation, and natural disasters. Our energy costs in future periods will depend principally on our ability to produce a substantial portion of our electricity needs internally, on changes in market prices for natural gas and on reducing energy usage.\nAny significant energy shortage or significant increase in our energy costs in circumstances where we cannot raise the price of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any disruption in the supply of energy could also affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to significant environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures, which could increase our costs and subject us to liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, water discharges, air emissions, hazardous material and waste management and environmental cleanup. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve and we may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues, such as reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. Increased regulatory activity at the state, federal and international level is possible regarding climate change as well as other emerging environmental issues associated with our manufacturing sites, such as water quality standards based on elevated fish consumption rates. Compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures on our part or even the curtailment of certain of our manufacturing operations.\nWe are required to comply with environmental laws and the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits. In particular, the pulp and paper industry in the United States is subject to several performance based rules associated with effluent and air emissions as a result of certain of its manufacturing processes. Federal, state and local laws and regulations require us to routinely obtain authorizations from and comply with the evolving standards of the appropriate governmental authorities, which have considerable discretion over the terms of permits. Failure to comply with environmental laws and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing our operations or requiring us to take corrective measures, install pollution control equipment, or take other remedial actions, such as product recalls or labeling changes. We also may be required to make additional expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters on an ongoing basis.\nWe own properties, conduct or have conducted operations at properties, and have assumed indemnity obligations for properties or operations where hazardous materials have been or were used for many years, including during periods before careful management of these materials was required or generally believed to be necessary. Consequently, we will continue to be subject to risks under environmental laws that impose liability for historical releases of hazardous substances and to liability for other potential violations of environmental laws or permits at existing sites or ones for which we have indemnity obligations.\nThere can be no assurance that future environmental permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew existing permits, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nLarger competitors have operational and other advantages over our operations.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive, and companies that have substantially greater financial resources compete with us in each market. Some of our competitors have advantages over us, including lower raw material and labor costs and better access to the inputs of our products.\nOur consumer products business faces competition from companies that produce the same type of products that we produce or that produce alternative products that customers may use instead of our products. Our consumer products business competes with the branded tissue products producers, such as Procter & Gamble, and branded label producers who manufacture branded and private label products, such as Georgia-Pacific and Kimberly-Clark. These companies are far larger than us, have more sales, marketing and research and development resources than we do, and enjoy significant cost advantages due to economies of scale. For example, in 2015 the net sales of our Consumer Products' segment was negatively impacted in part as a result of increased promotional activity for branded tissue\nproducts. In addition, because of their size and resources, these companies may foresee market trends more accurately than we do and develop new technologies that render our products less attractive or obsolete.\nOur ability to successfully compete in the pulp and paperboard industry is influenced by a number of factors, including manufacturing capacity, general economic conditions and the availability and demand for paperboard substitutes. Our pulp and paperboard business competes with International Paper, WestRock, Georgia-Pacific, and international producers, most of whom are much larger than us. Any increase in manufacturing capacity by any of these or other producers could result in overcapacity in the pulp and paperboard industry, which could cause downward pressure on pricing. For example, several newer facilities in China have large paperboard manufacturing capacities, the output of which is expected to increase paperboard supplies on the international market. Also a large European manufacturer is expected to begin paperboard production at a new facility with products intended for the North American market. Furthermore, customers could choose to use types of paperboard that we do not produce or could rely on alternative materials, such as plastic, for their products. An increased supply of any of these products could cause us to lower our prices or lose sales to competitors, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe consolidation of paperboard converting businesses, including through the acquisition and integration of such converting business by larger competitors of ours, could result in a loss of customers and sales on the part of our pulp and paperboard business, which does not include paperboard converting facilities or capabilities. A loss of paperboard customers or sales as a result of consolidations and integrations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur company-sponsored pension plans are currently underfunded, and we are required to make cash payments to the plans, reducing cash available for our business.\nWe have company-sponsored pension plans covering certain of our salaried and hourly employees. The volatility in the value of equity and fixed income investments held by these plans, coupled with a low interest rate environment resulting in higher liability valuations, has caused these plans to be underfunded as the projected benefit obligation has exceeded the aggregate fair value of plan assets by varying year-end amounts since 2008. At December 31, 2015, and 2014, our company sponsored pension plans were underfunded in the aggregate by $24.4 million and $16.9 million, respectively. As a result of underfunding, we may be required to make contributions to our qualified pension plans. In 2015, we contributed $3.2 million to these pension plans. We may be required to make increased annual contributions to our pension plans in future years, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs.\nWe may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer pension plans.\nWe contribute to two multiemployer pension plans. The amount of our annual contributions to each of these plans is negotiated with the plan and the bargaining unit representing our employees covered by the plan. In 2015, we contributed approximately $6 million to these plans, and in future years we may be required to make increased annual contributions, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs. In addition, in the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by us from any multiemployer plan that is underfunded, we would be liable for a proportionate share of such multiemployer plan's unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A withdrawal liability is considered a contingent liability. In the event that any other contributing employer withdraws from any multiemployer plan that is underfunded, and such employer cannot satisfy its obligations under the multiemployer plan at the time of withdrawal, then the proportionate share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits that would be allocable to us and to the other remaining contributing employers, would increase and there could be an increase to our required annual contributions. In renegotiations of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that participate in these multiemployer plans, we may decide to discontinue participation in these plans.\nOne of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute, the PACE Industry Union-Management Pension Fund, or PIUMPF, was certified to be in \u201ccritical status\u201d for the plan year beginning January 1, 2010, and continued to be in critical status through the plan year beginning January 1, 2014. For the plan year beginning January 1, 2015, PIUMPF was certified to be in \"critical and declining status\" under the Multiemployer Pension Plan Reform Act of 2014. In 2013, two large employers withdrew from PIUMPF and subsequent to December 31, 2015, we learned that the largest employer in PIUMPF has also withdrawn. Further withdrawals by contributing employers could cause a \u201cmass withdrawal\u201d from, or effectively a termination of, PIUMPF or alternatively we could elect to withdraw. Although we have no current intention to withdraw from PIUMPF, if we were to withdraw, either completely or partially, we would incur a withdrawal liability based on our share of PIUMPF\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. Based on information as of December 31, 2014 provided by PIUMPF and reviewed by our actuarial consultant, we estimate that, as of December 31, 2015, the payments that we would be required to make to PIUMPF in the event of our complete withdrawal would be approximately $5.7 million per year on a pre-tax basis. These payments would continue for 20 years, unless we were deemed to be included in a \u201cmass withdrawal\u201d from PIUMPF, in which case these payments would continue in perpetuity.\nHowever, we are not able to determine the exact amount of our withdrawal liability because the amount could be higher or lower depending on the nature and timing of any triggering event, the funded status of the plan and our level of contributions to the plan prior to the triggering event. These withdrawal liability payments would be in addition to pension contributions to any new pension plan adopted or contributed to by us to replace PIUMPF, all of which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs. Adverse changes to pension laws and regulations could increase the likelihood and amount of our liabilities arising under PIUMPF.\nOur pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors that could cause these costs to change.\nIn addition to our pension plans, we provide health care benefits to certain of our current and former U.S. salaried and hourly employees. There is a risk of increased costs due to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate and required coverage. Our health care costs vary with changes in health care costs generally, which have significantly exceeded general economic inflation rates for many years. Our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions about future investment returns. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased pension costs in future periods. Likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and mortality rates could also increase pension costs. Significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face cyber-security risks.\nOur business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation and updating, our information technology systems could become subject to cyber-attacks. Network, system, application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation, which could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain raw materials required for the production of our products.\nOur dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers, and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials, involve several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality, and delivery schedules. We cannot be certain that our current suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of these raw materials that we require or will continue to satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements. Any supply interruption in limited raw materials could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be identified and qualified. Although we believe there are other suppliers of these raw materials, we may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms. Any performance failure on the part of our suppliers could interrupt production of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur efforts to increase operational efficiencies may not be fully achieved.\nOur near term strategy of increasing operational efficiencies and cost effectiveness may not be fully achieved. The capital projects we invest in may not achieve expected operational or financial results in the timeframes we anticipate, or at all. Such delays or failures could materially affect our business, cash flows and financial condition.\nAdditional expansion of our business through construction of new facilities or acquisitions may not proceed as anticipated.\nIn the future, we may build other converting and papermaking facilities, pursue acquisitions of existing facilities, or both. We may be unable to identify future suitable building locations or acquisition targets. In addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from construction projects or acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Any inability by us to integrate and manage any new or acquired facilities or businesses in a timely and efficient manner, any inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these projects or acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any unanticipated required increases in promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Large construction projects or acquisitions can result in a decrease in our cash and short-term investments, an increase in our indebtedness, or both, and also may limit our ability to access additional capital when needed and divert management's attention from other business concerns.\nTo service our substantial indebtedness, we must generate significant cash flows. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $569 million of outstanding indebtedness, and we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including our outstanding notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our senior secured revolving credit facility and our existing notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe indentures for our outstanding notes that we issued in 2013 and the credit agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility, contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business.\nThe indentures governing our outstanding notes that we issued in 2013 and the credit agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility, contain various provisions that limit our discretion in the operation of our business by restricting our ability to:\n\u25aa\nundergo a change in control;\n\u25aa\nsell assets;\n\u25aa\npay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u25aa\nmake investments and other restricted payments;\n\u25aa\nredeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u25aa\nincur additional debt and issue preferred stock;\n\u25aa\ncreate liens;\n\u25aa\nconsolidate, merge, or sell substantially all of our assets;\n\u25aa\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u25aa\nengage in new lines of business; and\n\u25aa\nenter into sale and lease-back transactions.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business at our discretion could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities. In addition, our senior secured revolving credit facility requires, among other things, that we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0-to-1.0 when availability falls below $50 million or an event of default exists. Events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet this financial test, and we cannot assure you that we will meet it.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our senior secured revolving credit facility or the indentures governing our outstanding notes, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could cause repayment of the debt to be accelerated.\nIf we are not able to comply with the covenants and other requirements contained in the indentures governing our outstanding notes, our senior secured revolving credit facility or our other debt instruments, an event of default under the relevant debt instrument could occur. If an event of default does occur, it could trigger a default under our other debt instruments, prohibit us from accessing additional borrowings, and permit the holders of the defaulted debt to declare amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be immediately due and payable. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments. In addition, we may not be able to refinance or restructure the payments on the applicable debt. Even if we were able to secure additional financing, it may not be available on favorable terms.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage hostile takeover attempts that some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the company and our stockholders. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include, among other things, the following:\n\u25aa\na classified Board of Directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u25aa\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u25aa\nstockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent;\n\u25aa\nadvance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our Board of Directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u25aa\nremoval of directors only for cause;\n\u25aa\nallowing only our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; and\n\u25aa\nsupermajority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of the company to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable the Board of Directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. We are also subject to Delaware laws that could have similar effects. One of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with a significant stockholder unless specific conditions are met.", "PERMNO": 92854, "SIC": 2670, "TIC": "CLW"}
