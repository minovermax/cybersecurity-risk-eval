{"cik": "1461993", "company": "MELINTA THERAPEUTICS, INC. /NEW/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference.\nIf any of the following risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline, and shareholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are not currently generating revenue from operations that is sufficient to cover our operating expenses and do not anticipate generating revenue sufficient to offset operating costs in the near term. We have incurred losses from operations since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of 719.8 million as of December 31, 2018. These losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on shareholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. If our operations do not produce the cash flow expected, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from sales of Baxdela, Vabomere, Orbactiv, and Minocin for injection; reimbursement of certain development costs by licensees of Baxdela, principally associated with our CABP Phase 3 clinical trial; fees and milestones earned under the license agreements we have entered into to distribute our products to companies in markets outside the United States, including our license agreement with Menarini; additional debt capital that may be available under our Deerfield Facility (including $50 million available until January 5, 2020 if we meet certain sales milestones by the end of 2019) and the Vatera Loan Agreement (up to $60 million available before July 10, 2019, after the initial draw of $75 million which occurred in February 2019); and the issuance of debt or equity financings, to the extent available. Our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital; our debt service requirements; operational expenses; commercialization and development activities for products and product candidates; potential non-operational payments related to the IDB acquisition and contractual obligations, including inventory and any royalty and milestone payments that will or may become due; and capital expenditures.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $81.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a net loss of approximately $157.2 million. Our net cash used in our operating activities was $171.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Our ability to become profitable and/or to generate positive cash from operations depends upon, among other things, our ability to generate revenues from sales of our marketed products and prudently manage our expenses. If we do not generate sufficient product revenues, or prudently manage our expenses, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nDuring 2018, we announced and/or implemented a number of cost savings initiatives designed to streamline our business, deliver profitability and extend our cash runway. These cost-savings initiatives are expected to result in between $50 and $70 million in operating expense savings in 2019, driven primarily by lower R&D and G&A expenses when compared to 2018. In addition, we are continuing to explore and evaluate other opportunities to enhance our liquidity, including further cost reductions, strategic licensing and partnership opportunities, potential capital raising activities and options to modify the terms of certain liabilities. There can be no assurances that these other initiatives will be available on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not successful with respect to the initiatives described above, or if our future operations fail to meet current sales expectations, our projected future liquidity may be limited, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and comply with financial-related covenants under the Deerfield Facility, as amended, and the Vatera Loan Agreement, and our ability to obtain such additional financing is limited by the terms of the Deerfield Facility and the Vatera Loan Agreement.\nWe have substantial cash needs to support our current operating plan, including supporting the ongoing sale and promotion of Baxdela, Vabomere, Minocin for injection and Orbactiv, as well as the development and commercialization of our\nproduct candidates and to support sales and marketing activities. Moreover, our fixed expenses such as rent, license payments, interest expense and other contractual commitments are substantial.\nOur future cash flows are dependent on key variables such as the level of sales achievement of our four marketed products, our ability to access additional debt capital under the Vatera Loan Agreement and the Deerfield Facility and, potentially, our ability to finance the Company with the issuance of new debt or equity.\nOur ability to obtain additional borrowings under the Vatera Loan Agreement (up to $25 million available in a single draw after March 31, 2019, but on or prior to June 30, 2019, and up to $35 million available in a single draw after June 30, 2019, but on or prior to July 10, 2019) is subject to our satisfaction of certain customary funding conditions, such as compliance with the covenants contained in that agreement, including the covenants described below. Our ability to obtain additional borrowings under the Deerfield Facility (including $50 million available until January 5,m 2020, if we meet certain sales milestones by the end of 2019) also is subject to satisfaction of certain customary funding conditions, such as compliance with the covenants contained in that agreement, including the covenants described below. The Deerfield Facility contains certain covenants, including requirements that we (i) deliver audited financial statements for each fiscal year, together with an audit opinion that does not contain a going concern qualification for any fiscal year ending on or after December 31, 2019, (ii) maintain a minimum cash balance of $40 million through March 31, 2020, and $25 million thereafter, and (iii) achieve net revenue from product sales of at least $63.75 million for the year ending December 31, 2019, and $85 million each year thereafter.\nOur operating forecasts include assumptions about our projected levels of sales growth, planned operating expenses, and other cash outflows. Revenue projections are inherently uncertain but have a higher degree of uncertainty in an early-stage commercial launch, which we have in Baxdela and Vabomere. In addition, if we are required to pay potential non-operational payments relating to the IDB acquisition, and after giving effect to net cash outflows from our operations, our cash balances may not be sufficient under the minimum cash balance covenants contained in the Deerfield credit agreement and the Vatera credit agreement described above. As a result, we may not be able to borrow additional amounts under our existing credit agreements. In addition, failure to comply with the minimum cash balance covenant would constitute a default under the Deerfield Facility and the Vatera Loan Agreement and, if not cured or waived, would allow our lenders to accelerate the related debt and, in the case of the Deerfield Facility which is secured by substantially all of our assets, would allow the lenders under that agreement to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt. In particular, recent sales trends, combined with our current projections, are likely to limit our ability to draw the additional $50 million available for borrowing under the Deerfield Facility until at least the second half of 2019 (because such borrowing is subject to our meeting certain net revenue targets by the end of 2019) and if we fail to satisfy the required sales milestones under the Deerfield Facility before January 5, 2020, we will no longer be able to draw the $50 million in additional loans. As such, we may need to raise additional funds to support our ongoing operations and to reduce our risk of default under our credit agreements.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of establishing sales, marketing, reimbursement capabilities, and the acceptance of our products by the marketplace;\n\u2022\nour ability to forecast demand for our products, thereby enabling our ability to manage working capital effectively;\n\u2022\npotential non-operational payments relating to the IDB acquisition;\n\u2022\npayments of milestones and royalties to third parties;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, progress, timing, scope and costs of our clinical trials, including the ability to timely enroll patients in our ongoing, planned and potential future clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nthe terms of any collaborative, license and other commercial relationships that Melinta may establish.\nMoreover, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. Securing additional financing, however, will require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management\u2019s ability to conduct our day-to-day operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nFurther, the terms of the Deerfield Facility and the Vatera Loan Agreement limit our ability to obtain additional financing, and the existence of the convertible loans under those agreements, including the ability to convert the convertible loans under the Vatera Loan Agreement into shares of our preferred stock, which have rights on liquidation senior to the rights of our common stockholders, may further impede our ability to obtain additional financing.\nWe are subject to certain covenants under the Deerfield Facility and the Vatera Loan Agreement that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, limiting access to additional debt capital to fund our operations. In addition, the Vatera Loan Agreement contains a clear market provision which restricts our ability to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of, or file a registration statement relating to, any common stock or any securities convertible into common stock, subject to certain exceptions, without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders (as defined in the Vatera Loan Agreement). This provision is effective until 90 days after our final disbursement under the Vatera Loan Agreement, which 90-day period will expire between September 29, 2019, and October 8, 2019, assuming that the final disbursement occurs between July 1, 2019, and July 10, 2019 (unless the facility is terminated prior to such final disbursements, in which case 90 days after such termination). This clear market provision does not restrict or prohibit negotiations or discussions with respect to, or the entering into any agreement for, or the filing of a registration statement with respect to, a merger or consolidation or any other combination of the Company with, or the acquisition of the Company by, another person (including by tender or exchange offer), any sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company or any other acquisition or similar transaction.\nAccordingly, the ability of the Company to enter into additional forms of financing may be limited and additional funds may not be available when needed on terms that are acceptable, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing shareholders.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be unable to fund our future operations, including the ongoing sales of our marketed products, as well as the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the support of sales and marketing activities. As a result, our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability may be substantially harmed, and we may be required to significantly curtail some or all of our activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates or some of our technologies or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.\nWe have substantial indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total indebtedness of $147.8 million and, on February 22, 2019, we incurred additional indebtedness of $80 million under the Vatera Loan Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, we have the ability to borrow an additional $60 million of convertible loans. We also have the ability to borrow an additional $50 million of loans under the Deerfield Facility (available before January 5, 2020), provided that certain revenue targets are achieved and other funding conditions are satisfied before the end of 2019. Having a substantial amount of leverage may have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product and service development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes, which is vital to our business;\n\u2022\nincreasing the risks of adverse consequences resulting from a breach of any indebtedness agreement, including, for example, a failure to make required payments of principal or interest due to failure of our business to perform as expected;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrestricting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or requiring non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nsubjecting our operations to restrictive covenants that may limit operating flexibility; and\n\u2022\nplacing our operations at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less highly leveraged.\nThe Vatera Loan Agreement and the Deerfield Facility contain restrictive covenants that may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions, as well as financial-related covenants.\nThe Vatera Loan Agreement and Deerfield Facility contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, subject in each case to customary exceptions, on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to: incur additional debt; pay distributions or dividends, redeem subordinated debt, repurchase equity or make other restricted payments; make certain investments; grant or permit certain liens on our assets; enter into certain transactions with affiliates; merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and transfer, sell or acquire assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries. As a result of these restrictions, we may be: limited in how we conduct our business; unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or unable to compete effectively or take advantage of new business opportunities. These restrictions also may affect our ability to execute our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Deerfield Facility contains certain financial-related covenants, including requirements that we (i) deliver audited financial statements for each fiscal year, together with an audit opinion that does not contain a going concern qualification for any fiscal year ending on or after December 31, 2019, (ii) maintain a minimum cash balance of $40 million through March 31, 2020, and $25 million thereafter, and (iii) achieve net revenue from product sales of at least $63.75 million for the year ending December 31, 2019, and $85 million each year thereafter.\nA breach of the covenants under either of our credit agreements could result in an event of default, may allow our lenders to accelerate the related debt, and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies. In addition, an event of default would permit the lenders under the applicable credit agreement to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such agreement. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Deerfield Facility, the lenders under that agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries would not have sufficient assets to repay that debt.\nProvisions in the Vatera Loan Agreement and the Deerfield Facility may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions in the Vatera Loan Agreement and the Deerfield Facility could have an adverse impact on the possibility of a potential acquisition of the Company.\n\u2022\nIf we enter into a transaction that constitutes a \u201cfundamental change\u201d under the Vatera Loan Agreement and a lender elects to convert its convertible loans in connection therewith, we may be required to increase the conversion rate depending on the then applicable stock price. The substantial number of shares that are issuable upon conversion of the convertible loans under the Vatera Loan Agreement may negatively impact the per share price that a third party may be willing to pay for the Company.\n\u2022\nFurthermore, upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Vatera Loan Agreement), the lenders under the Vatera Loan Agreement have the right to either convert their convertible loans (including at the fundamental change conversion price if the Change of Control also constitutes a fundamental change) or require payment in full at par plus accrued and unpaid interest. If the lenders, other than the Vatera-related entities, fail to timely deliver notice to us electing to convert their convertible loans under the agreement, we will be required to pay in cash to such lenders the full outstanding amount of the convertible loans held by such lenders. The Vatera-related entities may elect to continue to hold their convertible loans under the agreement instead of converting the loans or requiring payment in cash for such convertible loans, except that we may elect to prepay the convertible loans under the Vatera Loan Agreement held by the Vatera-related entities in connection with a change of control or a fundamental change in which the consideration to be paid to the holders of outstanding common stock (other than shares held by the Vatera-related entities) consists solely of cash at a per share price in excess of the then current conversion price (determined based on the common stock conversion rate).\n\u2022\nUpon a change of control (as defined in the Deerfield Facility), the lenders under the Deerfield Facility have the right to require payment in full of the outstanding loans under the agreement par plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThese and other provisions in the Deerfield Facility and the Vatera Loan Agreement could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring the Company, or adversely impact the price that an acquirer is willing to pay, even when the acquisition may otherwise be favorable to our stockholders.\nOur limited operating history exposes us to significant risks.\nPrior to our commercial launch of Baxdela and our acquisition of Vabomere, Orbactiv and Minocin for injection from Medicines in the first quarter of 2018, our operations were limited to financing and staffing our company, conducting discovery and product research and development activities, and engaging in commercial launch preparation activities. Given that we have had less than one year of commercial sales through December 31, 2018, the ability to predict our future performance may not be as accurate as it could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. Given our limited operating history and relatively recent product launches, it is difficult for us to predict our future revenues and working capital needs and, to the extent we encounter lower-than-expected sales or unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other known and unknown factors in achieving our business objectives, we may face difficulties in addressing these issues and our liquidity requirements. Further, given our limited operating history, we may incur significant costs in maintaining our salesforce, which costs may prove unnecessary or excessive if our product sales do not meet our expectations. Our likelihood of success must be evaluated in light of such challenges and variables and we may not be successful in our sales efforts or may incur greater costs than expected, both of which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf we are not successful with the commercial launches of our products, our business likely would be materially harmed.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we launched Baxdela and acquired Vabomere, Orbactiv and Minocin for injection from Medicines. Medicines launched Orbactiv in the United States in the third quarter of 2014, launched the new formulation of Minocin for injection in the United States in 2015 and launched Vabomere in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017. Commercial launches and continued commercial efforts for this number of products in such a short period of time has and will continue to require significant efforts from Melinta and the devotion of substantial resources as we continue to establish and maintain the infrastructure necessary to continue to commercialize these products, or any product line extensions, or products in development.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our Products will depend on our ability to:\n\u2022\ntrain, deploy and manage a qualified sales force to market and sell our Products;\n\u2022\nsecure formulary approvals at our hospital customers;\n\u2022\nhave third parties manufacture and release the products in sufficient quantities;\n\u2022\nimplement and maintain agreements with wholesalers, distributors and group purchasing organizations;\n\u2022\nreceive adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for these products from governments and third-party payors; and\n\u2022\ndevelop and execute effective marketing and sales strategies and programs for the Products.\nWe expect that the revenues from these products will represent a significant portion of our revenues in the future. As a result, if we are unable to successfully commercialize these products and products in development, our business, results of operations and financial condition likely would be materially harmed.\nWe are continuing to build our own marketing and sales organization, but have limited experience as a company in marketing drug products. If we are unable to successfully continue to develop our own marketing and sales capabilities, we may not be able to generate product revenues.\nIn order to successfully commercialize our products, we must develop capabilities (or make arrangements with third parties) for the marketing, sales and distribution of our products. We have and will need to incur significant additional expenses and commit significant additional resources to continue to grow our marketing and sales capabilities. We may not be able to successfully establish these capabilities despite these additional expenditures. Further, whether we market and sell products on our own or rely on a third party to do so, our ability to generate revenue will be dependent in part on the effectiveness of the sales force. We compete with other pharmaceutical and life sciences companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. In the event we are unable to successfully market and sell our products, either through our own marketing and sales capabilities or through collaboration with a third-party, our ability to generate product revenues would be negatively impacted and our business may be harmed.\nRecent changes in our executive leadership and any similar changes in the future may serve as a significant distraction for our management and employees.\nOn October 1, 2018, and October 22, 2018, respectively, our former Chief Financial Officer and our former Chief Executive Officer left Melinta, and Peter J. Milligan was appointed our new CFO and John H. Johnson was appointed as our interim CEO. On February 22, 2019, Mr. Johnson was appointed as our permanent CEO. Such changes, or any other future changes in our executive leadership, may disrupt our operations as we adjust to the reallocation of responsibilities and assimilate new leadership and, potentially, differing perspectives on our strategic direction. If the transition in executive leadership is not smooth, the resulting disruption could negatively affect our operations and impede our ability to execute our strategic plan.\nThe commercial success of our Products (including any line extension thereof) and any future product of Melinta will depend upon the degree of market acceptance of these products among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community.\nIt cannot be assured that our products (including any additional approved indications) or any of our product candidates that may be approved in the future will gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community. Efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our products and product candidates may require significant resources and may not be successful. The degree of market acceptance for our products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of such products as compared to other products pertaining to their respective indications;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of such products as compared to other products considered standard of care;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians and payors of each product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA approved labeling;\n\u2022\nthe market price and patient out-of-pocket costs of the product relative to other treatment options, including any generics;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nwillingness by clinicians to stop using current treatments and adopt a new treatment;\n\u2022\nrestriction on healthcare provider prescribing of, and patient access to, products due to a risk evaluation mitigation strategy;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit and retain a sales force, if necessary;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our or any third-party partner\u2019s sales force and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nour ability to forecast demand and maintain sufficient supplies of our drug products;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture or obtain commercial quantities of our drug products;\n\u2022\nthe strength of our sales and marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our sales organization to reach the necessary prescribers and accounts on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns;\n\u2022\nproduct availability and our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which bacteria develop resistance to any antibiotic product candidate that we develop, thereby limiting its efficacy in treating or managing infections;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain pricing sufficient to realize a meaningful return on our investment;\n\u2022\nacceptance on hospital formularies (which may limit sales activities in those hospitals);\n\u2022\nwhether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy for particular infections;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other health care payors, and/or by government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about a product or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022\npotential product recalls: and\n\u2022\npotential product liability claims.\nThe successful commercialization of our Products will depend on the prices we receive for our products.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will be dependent on whether market conditions or government requirements affect our ability to receive adequate pricing for any particular product. Pricing may be substantially dependent on our ability to obtain reimbursement from third-party payors, both in the United States and in foreign countries. Outside the United States, certain countries, including a number of European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) members, set prices and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, or medicinal products as they are commonly referred to in the E.U., with limited participation from those marketing the products. We cannot be sure that any prices and reimbursement will be acceptable to our strategic commercial partners. If the regulatory authorities in these foreign jurisdictions set prices or reimbursement that are not commercially attractive for our strategic commercial partners, our revenues from milestones and/or sales-based royalties paid by our partners, and the potential profitability of our product candidates, in those countries would be negatively affected. Further, through contractual or other arrangements, the price we may be able to obtain in foreign countries may be dependent on the price we can achieve in the United States.\nIf we fail to obtain and sustain an adequate level of reimbursement for our products or future approved products by third-party payors, sales would be adversely affected.\nThere will be no commercially viable market for our products or any future approved products without reimbursement from third-party payors. If payor coverage is restricted or the level of reimbursement is below our expectations, our revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nThird-party payors, such as government or private health care insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the company, the insurance plan and other factors. A current trend in the U.S. health care industry is toward cost containment. Large public and private payors, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such third-party payors, including Medicare, are questioning the coverage of, and increasingly challenging the prices charged for, medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit coverage of or reimbursement for newly approved health care products. In particular, third-party payors may limit the covered indications. Cost-control initiatives that affect our commercial market could decrease the price we might establish for products, which would result in product revenues being lower than anticipated. If the prices for our products decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels, our revenue and prospects for profitability will suffer. Further, the availability of numerous generic antibiotics at lower prices than branded antibiotics may also substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for such products.\nSpecifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act (\u201cMMA\u201d), changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation\nexpanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, \u201cACA\u201d) became law in the United States The goal of ACA is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. While we cannot predict what ultimate impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of future products. Members of the U.S. Congress and some state legislatures had sought to overturn at least portions of the legislation including those on the mandatory purchase of insurance. However, on June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of these provisions. Members of the U.S. Congress have since proposed a number of legislative initiatives, including repeal of all or portions of the ACA. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services is considering a number of proposals that, if adopted, could dramatically change the way the government, and eventually private payors, cover and reimburse prescription drugs. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of current proposals or whether new proposals will be made or adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us if they are adopted.\nReimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. Reimbursement in the European Union must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. The negotiation process in some countries can exceed 12 months.\nOur estimates of the market for, and the commercialization potential of, our Products, additional indications or uses for our Products, or for any product candidate, may be inaccurate or vary significantly from the market size ultimately realized.\nThe potential market opportunities for our Products, additional indications or uses for our Products, and any product candidates are difficult to estimate. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities are predicated on many assumptions, including industry knowledge and publications, third-party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment on the part of our management, and are inherently uncertain. If any of the assumptions proves to be inaccurate, the actual markets for our products and candidates could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunities.\nIn addition, our estimates regarding the timing and amount of acceptance of any product (including any line extension) or product candidate, and the pricing we are able to receive for any product or product candidate may prove incorrect. Further, our plans for commercialization of any product candidate may not materialize in the time or manner we anticipate and may be adversely impacted by any required warnings in the product labeling, any perceived safety or efficacy concerns, competitive products entering or already in the market, or the actions of our competitors. Finally, we may underestimate the demand for a product, which could lead to lack of commercial quantities when needed and result in market backlash against the product. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our plans for commercialization of and the generation of any revenue from any product or product candidate.\nA failure to maintain optimal inventory levels for any of our Products or any future approved products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAccurate product planning is necessary to ensure that we maintain optimal inventory levels for any of our products or any future approved products. Significant differences between our estimates and judgments and future actual demand for any of our products or any future approved products and the shelf life of inventory may result in the Company maintaining significant excess inventory. This risk is particularly heightened because our manufacturing lead team varies by product (and for some products this lead time can exceed two years) and we have limited historical sales performance for our products and as such, may not successfully predict our product revenues over the near or long term. See \u201cOur limited operating history exposes us to significant risks.\u201d If the Company maintains excess inventory, this will harm our liquidity and we may be required to recognize significant charges for excess inventories, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to maintain optimal inventory levels also depends on the performance of third-party contract manufacturers. If our manufacturers are unsuccessful in either obtaining raw materials, if we are unable to release inventory on a timely and consistent basis, if we fail to maintain an adequate level of product inventory, if inventory is destroyed or damaged, or if our inventory reaches its expiration date, we could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our competitors are able to develop and market products that are preferred over our Products or any future approved products, our commercial opportunity for such products will be reduced.\nWe face competition from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, which may in the future develop products to treat ABSSSI, CABP, cUTI or other diseases or conditions that our products and product candidates target. In many cases, however, we believe that competition often will be determined by antibiotic class and any limitations of that antibiotic class in general, and the antibiotic treating a particular disease or population.\nIn particular, there are a variety of available therapies marketed for the treatment of ABSSSI. Some of these products are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved products are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and hospital decision-makers. Vancomycin, for instance, which is sold in a relatively inexpensive generic form, has been widely used for over 50 years, is the most frequently used IV antibiotic, and we believe, based on our market research, is prescribed to approximately two-thirds of all hospitalized ABSSSI patients. Insurers and other third-party payers may encourage the use of generic products. There are also a number of products in clinical development by third parties to treat ABSSSI.\nIf any of these product candidates or any other products developed by our competitors are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than our products, or would otherwise render our products obsolete or non-competitive, our anticipated revenues from our products could be adversely affected.\nWe expect that our ability to compete effectively will depend upon, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully and rapidly complete clinical trials and obtain all required regulatory approvals in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nmaintain patent protection for and otherwise prevent the introduction of generics;\n\u2022\nattract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\nbuild an adequate sales and marketing infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nobtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors.\nOur dependence upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of our marketed products and any of our product candidates that may be approved in the future, may cause delays in, or prevent us from, successfully developing, commercializing and/or marketing our products.\nWe do not currently have nor do we plan to build the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our Products or product candidates. We rely upon and expect to continue to rely upon third-parties, almost all of which are single source, for the manufacture and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPI\u201d) contained in our products and product candidates, as well as the preparation of finished products and their packaging.\nBefore any of our products manufactured by contract manufacturers can be distributed, an NDA containing appropriate chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information must be approved by the FDA. In addition, our contract manufacturers must maintain a compliance status that is acceptable to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, before and after product approval. Due to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture pharmaceutical products and product candidates, any potential third-party manufacturer may be unable to continue to pass or initially pass federal, state or international regulatory inspections in a cost-effective manner or at all.\nAlthough we do not control the day-to-day operations of our contract manufacturers, we are responsible for ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. If a third-party manufacturer with whom we contract is unable to comply with manufacturing regulations, our product candidates may not be approved or we may be subject to fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure of our products, total or partial suspension of production and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions, and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions would adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nIn addition, our reliance on foreign suppliers poses risks due to possible shipping delays, import restrictions and foreign regulatory regimes.\nWe also could experience manufacturing delays if our third-party manufacturers give greater priority to the supply of other products over our products or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreement between us. If any supplier of API or finished drug product for our products experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes, does not comply with the terms of the agreement between us or does not devote sufficient time, energy and care to providing our manufacturing needs, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of API, which could prevent or delay our development, commercialization and/or sales activities. Finally, any manufacturing facility is at risk of natural or man-made disaster, which could significantly reduce our clinical and commercial supplies of drug product, particularly given the single-source nature of our manufacturing and supply model.\nThe timing of the milestone and royalty payments we are required to make to third parties is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are party to various agreements pursuant to which we are obligated to make milestone payments or pay royalties in connection with the development and commercialization of our product candidates or sales of our marketed products. The timing of our achievement of these milestones and the corresponding milestone payments, or the amount of our royalty payments, is subject to factors which are difficult to predict and for which many are beyond our control. We may become obligated to make a milestone or other payment at a time when we do not have sufficient funds to make such payment, or at a time that would otherwise require us to use funds needed to continue to operate our business, which could delay our clinical trials, curtail our operations, necessitate a scaling back of our sales and marketing efforts or cause us to seek funds to meet these obligations on terms unfavorable to us. If we are unable to make any payment when due or if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain development and commercialization milestones within the timeframes required by certain of these agreements, the other party may have the right to terminate the agreement and all of our rights to develop and commercialize product candidates using the applicable technology.\nWe may not realize the benefits of our 2018 acquisition of IDB from Medicines and may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges related to the acquisition that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nIntegrating the acquired operations of the infectious disease business of Medicines successfully or otherwise realizing any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and the MDCO Products, including additional revenue opportunities, involves a number of challenges. In addition, although Melinta conducted due diligence on the MDCO Products. there is no assurance that this diligence revealed all material issues that may be present, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of Melinta\u2019s control will not later arise. As a result, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we wrote off goodwill associated with the IDB transaction of approximately $25.1 million. Unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our original due diligence. Even though these risks may be non-cash items and may not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that Melinta reports charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about Melinta or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause Melinta to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining development and commercialization collaborations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval, establishing manufacturing capabilities, marketing approved products, and adhering to post-marketing regulatory requirements and commitments is expensive. To aid in these efforts, we have established significant commercial relationships to market Baxdela outside the United States, including with Eurofarma and Menarini, and we have entered into a commercial agreement for Vabomere, Orbactiv and Minocin for injection in Europe with Menarini. We intend to continue to enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third parties for international sales, and to develop and maintain our own sales force in the United States. We may also establish additional collaborations, licensing agreements, or alternative arrangements for the commercialization of our Products, as well as for the development and commercialization of product candidates and research programs, including funding potentially other products and indications. If we are unable to maintain our existing arrangements or enter into any new such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all, we may be unable to effectively market and sell our products in our target markets.\nIf we partner with a third party for development and commercialization of a product candidate, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate to the third party. Our collaboration partner may not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in commercialization. The terms of any collaboration or other arrangement that we establish may not be favorable to us. In addition, any collaboration that we enter into may be unsuccessful in the development and commercialization of our product candidates. In some cases, we may be responsible for continuing clinical development of a partnered product candidate or research program, and the payment we receive from our collaboration partner may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development.\nClinical trials are a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive, can take many years to complete and its outcome is highly uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process due to inadequate performance of a drug or inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols. Pursuant to FDA guidelines, new antibiotic drugs generally must show non-inferiority or superiority to existing approved treatments in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if such approved treatments exist.\nWe face these same risks for our pre-clinical and clinical product candidates, as well as for new indications and uses for our approved products.\nIn addition, the results of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials of product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials despite achieving successful results in earlier stage trials. The failure to obtain positive results in any of our potential Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials could seriously impair the development prospects, and even prevent regulatory approval of, any of our product candidates or additional indications for our marketed products. Even with positive clinical trial results, there is risk that regulators will not accept the clinical trial findings or will require additional trials or other data. For example, our NDAs for oral and intravenous solithromycin received complete response letters from the FDA, which stated that the FDA could not approve the NDAs in their present form and noted that additional clinical safety information and the satisfactory resolution of manufacturing facility inspection deficiencies were required before the NDAs may be considered for approval. Melinta did not acquire sufficient funding to perform the clinical safety study necessary to support approval of solithromycin in the United States, and therefore, decided not to execute the clinical safety study.\nFurther, regulatory approvals in foreign countries are subject to risks associated with different regulatory requirements, including clinical trial guidance and varying regulatory schemes. As a result, clinical trial results and other regulatory processes undertaken by us within the United States may not be accepted in foreign countries, which would add to the cost and time to develop our product candidates in foreign countries.\nMelinta cannot be certain that its product candidates will receive regulatory approval, or that its existing products will receive regulatory approval for additional uses, or that it will receive the requested exclusivity periods.\nMelinta anticipates filing a sNDA with the FDA for Baxdela for the treatment of adult patients with CABP in the first half of 2019. Beyond the potential label expansion of Baxdela, Melinta may continue to pursue other development opportunities, either itself or through third-party collaborations or alternative arrangements.\nMelinta\u2019s business is dependent in part on its ability to complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize such current and future product line extensions and product candidates in a timely manner. The process to develop, obtain regulatory approval for product candidates and subsequently commercialize such products is long, complex, uncertain and costly.\nThe development of a product candidate and issues relating to its approval and sale are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and regulatory authorities in other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. Melinta is not permitted to commercialize, market or sell Melinta\u2019s product candidates or additional indications or uses for marketed products in the United States until it receives approval of an NDA (or sNDA) from the FDA. An NDA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and effectiveness for each desired indication. The NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. Melinta is currently dependent on the work conducted by contract organizations for these activities. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and ultimately may not be obtained. FDA approvals are never guaranteed. If Melinta submits an NDA or sNDA to the FDA, the FDA must decide whether to accept or reject the submission for filing. Melinta cannot be certain that any submissions will be accepted for filing and review by the FDA. Even if a product is approved, the FDA may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, include extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming post-approval clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. Foreign regulatory authorities also have requirements for approval of drug candidates with which Melinta's partners must comply prior to marketing. Obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of a product candidate in one country does not ensure that Melinta or our partners will be able to obtain regulatory approval in other countries. In addition, delays in approvals or rejections of marketing applications in the United States or foreign countries may be based upon many factors, including:\n\u2022\nMelinta\u2019s inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may make requests for additional analyses, reports, data and studies;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or comparable foreign regulatory authority\u2019s disagreement regarding Melinta\u2019s interpretation of data and results;\n\u2022\ninability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of a product candidate outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe potential for changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development that may render Melinta\u2019s clinical data insufficient for approval;\n\u2022\ninability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication as Melinta\u2019s product candidates; or\n\u2022\nthe emergence of new information regarding Melinta\u2019s product candidates or other products.\nUnder the GAIN Act, the FDA may designate a product as a QIDP. Upon approval of a drug designated by the FDA as a QIDP, five-year NCE exclusivity, three-year exclusivity, and seven-year orphan drug exclusivity are extended by an additional five years. For Baxdela, regulatory exclusivity based on NCE, plus its 5-year extension as a QIDP under the GAIN Act, extends to 2027; for Orbactiv, regulatory exclusivity under NCE, plus its extension under the GAIN Act, extends to 2024. In December 2013, the FDA designated Vabomere as a QIDP, and in a letter dated August 29, 2017, the FDA stated that the Vabomere application meets the criteria for the five-year GAIN exclusivity extension. Currently, Vabomere\u2019s application for five-year NCE exclusivity is pending before the CDER Exclusivity Board. If the FDA does not grant Vabomere the requested NCE exclusivity and instead grants three-year exclusivity, we would still obtain our GAIN exclusivity, but our total exclusivity period would be eight years rather than ten years, which could adversely affect our business related to Vabomere.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any such delays could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales as currently contemplated.\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials of new uses, dosing, or formulations of our approved products, or potential product candidates. Our planned clinical trials might not begin on time, may be interrupted or delayed once commenced, might need to be redesigned, might not enroll a sufficient number of patients or might not be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site;\n\u2022\ndelays in identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u2022\ntime required to add new sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials, including suitable active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, whether of our product candidates or comparator drugs; or\n\u2022\ndelays resulting from negative or equivocal findings of the data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, for a trial.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. In addition, the timing of our clinical trials may be dependent on specific disease seasonality. We could encounter delays in our ongoing and future clinical trials of products if participating physician investigators encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of any product in lieu of prescribing approved antibiotics that have established safety and efficacy profiles. Any of these delays in completing our clinical trials could increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues.\nOur approved Products or product candidates may have undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings, become subject to FDA required risk evaluation and mitigation strategies or other remediation activities.\nIf Melinta or another party identifies undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by our approved products:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022\nMelinta may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u2022\nMelinta may be subject to limitations on how it may promote the product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require Melinta to take its approved product off the market;\n\u2022\nMelinta may be subject to litigation or product liability claims;\n\u2022\nMelinta\u2019s reputation may suffer;\n\u2022\nrelationships with Melinta\u2019s licensing partners may be harmed; and\n\u2022\nsales of the product may decrease significantly or fail to gain market acceptance.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be delayed in obtaining, or may ultimately not be able to obtain, regulatory approval for or commercialize line extensions of our Products or any of our product candidates.\nWe have relied, and plan to continue to rely, on CROs to recruit patients, monitor and manage data for our on-going clinical programs. We control only certain aspects of our CROs\u2019 activities; nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s cGCPs which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our products in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before deciding whether to approve our product candidates. In addition, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of any product candidate to a statistically significant degree CROs conducting our clinical trials abroad will require an adequately large number of test subjects. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may have to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIn addition, our CROs are not our employees and we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical programs. Our CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could impede their ability to devote appropriate time to our clinical programs. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize product candidates that we seek to develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for these product candidates that we seek to develop would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed or ended.\nWhether our current Products, potential line extensions or product candidates are successful or not, our future growth may depend in part on our ability to identify, develop, acquire or in-license products and if we do not successfully identify develop, acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates or integrate them into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.\nAn important part of our business strategy has been to develop, acquire or in-license products, businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our focus developing anti-infectives to treat infectious diseases. However, these business activities may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such development, acquisition or in-licensed products or technologies;\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for development, acquisition or in-licensing of new products;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected development, acquisition or in-license and integration costs;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel and retaining key personnel.\nWe may need to grow our organization if we acquire or in-license products or develop and receive approval for additional indications or uses of our Products, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of February 28, 2019, we had approximately 290 employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies progress and develop, we may need to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources, including sales and marketing resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from their day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Future growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage any future growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our\nbusiness strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth in our organization.\nComprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, the US government signed into law comprehensive tax legislation, referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act introduced significant changes to the US tax laws.\nThe Tax Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including (i) reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%; (ii) limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses); (iii) limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income in respect of losses arising in taxable years beginning after 2017; (iv) elimination of net operating loss carrybacks; (v) one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated; (vi) immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time; and (vii) modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions generally referred to as \u201corphan drugs\u201d). Our federal net operating loss carryovers for taxable years beginning after 2017 will be carried forward indefinitely pursuant to the Tax Act.\nThe Tax Act did not have a material impact on our financial statements because our deferred temporary differences are fully offset by a valuation allowance and we do not have any significant offshore earnings from which to record the mandatory transition tax. However, given the significant complexity of the Tax Act, anticipated guidance from the US Treasury about implementing the Tax Act, and the potential for additional guidance from the SEC or the FASB related to the Tax Act, these estimates may be adjusted during the measurement period. We continue to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nBacteria might develop resistance to our Products or product candidates, which would decrease the efficacy and commercial viability of that product.\nBacteria develop resistance to antibiotics over time due to the genetic mutation of the bacteria. Many current and previous antibiotics have suffered reduced efficacy over time due to the development of resistance to such drugs. It is probable that, over time, bacteria will also develop resistance to our products and our drug candidates. If resistance were to develop rapidly to our products or our drug candidates, this would reduce the commercial potential for our business.\nWe are subject to existing and potential additional regulation and government inquiry, which can impose burdens on our operations and narrow the markets for our products.\nWe are subject, both directly and indirectly, to the adverse impact of existing and potential future government regulation of our operations and markets. Our Products are, and any future approved product candidates will be, subject to regulation by the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities. These regulations govern a wide variety of product related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with the FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements, or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of its products or those of its customers; or the inability to sell such products. Any such regulatory actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory challenges.\nThe FDA may impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. In addition, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies regulate our products and impose ongoing requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The holder of an approved NDA is subject to obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials. Legal requirements have also been enacted to require disclosure of clinical trial results on publicly available databases.\nManufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. In addition, manufacturers must comply with regulations promulgated by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission, that govern packaging, labeling, and country of origin markings. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown issues or deficiencies with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, issues with a product's packaging or labeling, or problems with the facility where a product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose penalties, corrective measures, and/or implement restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing, requiring new warnings or other labeling changes to limit use of the drug, requiring that we conduct additional clinical trials, imposing new monitoring requirements, or requiring that we establish risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. Moreover, because our inputs and products cross borders, they are subject to duties, fees, and taxes that can be amended or altered by government actors, affecting the prices of our products in ways that could be material. Action, or inaction, by government authorities at or concerning border points of entry and exit also can cause supply chain delays, including the suspension or detention of goods. And deficiencies or errors by the company or its employees or agents with respect to importing and exporting obligations and declarations, including with respect to the classifications, descriptions, valuations, and origins of goods, can results in additional duties, fees, and penalties. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA and other regulatory agency rules in addition to other applicable federal and state laws and regulations. The distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act. the packaging of products is subject to regulations, including under the Poison Packaging and Prevention Act. Government pricing and rebate programs must comply with statutory and regulatory requirements. Our products that are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration are subject to additional requirements, including manufacture of origin. Finally, many of our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, false advertising, and unfair competition laws. If we or our third-party collaborators fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nconduct an investigation into our practices and any alleged violation of law;\n\u2022\nissue warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u2022\nseize or detain products or refuse to permit the import or export of products;\n\u2022\nrequire us to initiate a product recall; or\n\u2022\nrefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nThe occurrence or investigation of any event or penalty described above may force us to expend significant amounts of time and resources, and may significantly inhibit our ability to bring to market or continue to market our products and generate revenues. Similar regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions.\nBecause we may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for some of our products (including any line extensions) or product candidates, we may not generate revenue in the amounts we expect, or in the amounts necessary to continue our business.\nAll of our proposed and existing products are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA and/or other domestic and international governmental, public health agencies, regulatory bodies or non-governmental organizations. In particular, we are subject to strict governmental controls on the development, manufacture, labeling, distribution and marketing of our products and product candidates. The process of obtaining required approvals or clearances varies according to the nature of and uses for, a specific product or product candidate. These processes can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory testing, human clinical trials, sampling activities, and other costly, time-consuming procedures. The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that the authority will grant an approval or clearance for a product or product candidate. Each authority may impose its own requirements and can delay or refuse to grant approval or clearance, even though a product or product candidate has been approved in another country.\nThe time taken to obtain approval varies depending on the nature of the application and may result in the passage of a significant period of time from the date of submission of the application. Delays in the approval or clearance processes increase the risk that we will not succeed in introducing or selling the subject products or product candidates, and we may be required to abandon a proposed product or product candidate after devoting substantial time and resources to its development.\nChanges in domestic and foreign government regulations could increase our costs and could require us to undergo additional trials or procedures, or could make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all.\nChanges in government regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations because we may have to incur additional expenses if we are required to change or implement new testing, manufacturing and control procedures. If we are required to devote resources to develop such new procedures, we may not have sufficient resources to devote to research and development, marketing, or other activities that are critical to our business.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or recall or withdrawal from the market, and we may therefore be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our drug candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nAs with our current marketed products, any product candidate or new indication, use or formulation of our Products for which we obtain marketing approval, along with manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such new product or use, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate or line extension of a marketed Product is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying labeling may limit the approved use of our product, which could limit its sales.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA also regulates manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding a product candidate or new use or indication of an approved product prior to FDA approval; if we market our products before such approval, we may be subject to enforcement actions for pre-approval promotion.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may have negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nrecall or withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nclinical holds;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of revenue or profit;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products or components of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nWe are subject to healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nWe are subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, including physicians, pharmacists, and allied healthcare professionals play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our Products. Our arrangements with healthcare providers, as well as third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our Products. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nThe federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the ACA includes various provisions designed to strengthen significantly fraud and abuse enforcement, such as increased funding for enforcement efforts and the lowering of the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and criminal health care fraud statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it.\n\u2022\nThe federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including those from civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the\nfederal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.\n\u2022\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\n\u2022\nThe federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\n\u2022\nThe federal transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the \"Sunshine Act,\" under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report on an annual basis to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to transfers of value to certain healthcare professionals, teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests.\n\u2022\nAnalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing.\n\u2022\nIn addition, under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of prescription products such as antibiotics to ensure such products are marketed only for the approved indications, uses, and patient population and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Although, healthcare providers may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, the FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use, and if we do not market our products for their approved indications and uses, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the FDCA relating to the promotion of prescription products may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws. Notwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the FDA and other regulatory authorities permit companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning their products. In addition, recent FDA guidance suggests that there are circumstances in which the FDA would not object to the promotion of certain information that is not included in the approved labeling, provided that this information is consistent with the approved labeling and otherwise complies with applicable regulations.\nEnsuring that our business arrangements with third parties and interactions with healthcare providers comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations requires us to dedicate significant resources. Despite our efforts, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not fully comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations, including activities conducted by our sales team, were found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines and exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could result in adverse publicity, substantially disrupt our operations an materially adversely affect our business. Moreover, if any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nFuture legislation, and/or regulations and policies adopted by the FDA or other regulatory health authorities may increase the time and cost required for us to conduct and complete clinical trials for product candidates that we develop.\nThe FDA has established regulations, guidelines and policies to govern the drug development and approval process, as have foreign regulatory authorities. Any change in regulatory requirements due to the adoption by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities of new legislation, regulations, or policies may require us to amend existing clinical trial protocols or add new clinical trials to comply with these changes. Such amendments to existing protocols and/or clinical trial applications or the need for new ones, may significantly impact the cost, timing and completion of the clinical trials.\nIn addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process, particularly in our areas of focus, may significantly delay or prevent regulatory approval, as well as impose more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nEven if we obtain FDA approval of a given product candidate, we may fail to obtain approval for or be able to commercialize such product outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential. If foreign approval is obtained, there are risks in conducting business in international markets.\nIn order to market a product outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approvals could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and require additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials which would be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. Satisfying these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays.\nIf we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in a foreign country or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our potential market for products will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed.\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks associated with Products and product candidates that are approved outside of the United States that could materially adversely affect our business.\nWith respect to our Products or product candidates which are approved outside the United States, we have entered into and will likely enter into additional agreements with third parties to commercialize such product outside the United States. We are, and expect that we will be, subject to additional risks related to entering into or maintaining these international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndiffering U.S. and foreign drug import and export rules;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferent reimbursement systems;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\npotential liability resulting from development work conducted by these distributors; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, as well as the anti-bribery laws of the nations in which we conduct business, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition, we are subject to other anti-bribery laws of the nations in which we conduct business that apply similar prohibitions as the FCPA, including the UK Bribery Act. Our employees, consultants, contractors or agents may engage in prohibited conduct without our knowledge, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws ,for which we may be held responsible. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could materially damage our reputation and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.\nEurope has enacted a new data privacy regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation, with hefty enforcement penalties, a violation of which could subject us to significant fines.\nIn May 2018, a new privacy regime, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), took effect and is binding across all member states of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d). The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials, the transmission of safety data and other activities conducted in the EEA by expanding the definition of personal data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices. The GDPR also increases our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules. It also imposes substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to four percent of global turnover or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements. Compliance with these obligations will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business, and the failure to comply with these laws could subject us to significant fines.\nIf we or our vendors fail to comply with the GDPR, or if the legal mechanisms we or our vendors rely upon to allow for the transfer of personal data from the EEA or Switzerland to the U.S. (or other countries not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection) are not considered adequate, we could be subject to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and our business could be adversely impacted if our ability to transfer personal data outside of the EEA or Switzerland is restricted, which could adversely impact our operating results. In addition, data protection authorities of the different EU Member States may interpret the GDPR differently, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU and transfer of such data outside the EEA. In addition, the privacy and data security landscape in the EU Member States continues to remain in flux as the final decision on UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU may require organizations to revisit the way they transfer personal data from and to the UK from the EU.\nAlthough there are legal mechanisms to allow for the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the US, a decision of the European Court of Justice in the Schrems case (Case C-362/14 Maximillian Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner) that invalidated the safe harbor framework has increased uncertainty around compliance with EU privacy law requirements. As a result of the decision, it was no longer possible to rely on the safe harbor certification as a legal basis for the transfer of personal data from the EU to entities in the US. On February 29, 2016, however, the European Commission announced an agreement with the United States Department of Commerce (DOC) to replace the invalidated Safe Harbor framework with a new EU-US \u201cPrivacy Shield.\u201d On July 12, 2016, the European Commission adopted a decision on the adequacy of the protection provided by the Privacy Shield; however, this decision has been subsequently challenged. If the Privacy Shield is ultimately invalidated, it will no longer be possible to rely on the Privacy Shield certification to support transfer of personal data from the EU to entities in the US. Adherence to the Privacy Shield is not mandatory and US-based companies are permitted to rely either on their adherence to the Privacy Shield or on the other authorized means and procedures to transfer personal data provided by the GDPR. However, a decision rendering the Privacy Shield invalid may give rise to further insecurity concerning appropriate means for US companies to comply with the GDPR and related data privacy obligations in the EU.\nProduct liability lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our products.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of sales of our marketed products as well from the clinical testing of our product candidates despite obtaining appropriate informed consents from our clinical trial participants. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection laws. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products or product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our products or product candidates; and\n\u2022\na decline in our stock price.\nThe cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. In addition, inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, in connection with which we could become subject to liabilities, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or incur costs, that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time our operations involve and may, in the future, involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our handling, use, storage, treatment, release or disposal of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability, which in certain cases could be joint and several, could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs, civil or criminal fines, penalties, or other sanctions for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental health and safety laws and regulations, which have tended to become more stringent over time.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims.\nIf we are not successful in retaining or attracting as necessary highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries depends in large part on our ability to retain or attract as necessary highly qualified managerial, scientific, medical and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is very intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all. Our current levels of total compensation may be below the level of companies who seek to hire our current employees, impacting our ability to retain members of our team. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and medical teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could potentially harm our business, operating results or financial condition. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled scientific and medical personnel.\nOther biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and longer histories than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to discover, develop and commercialize drug candidates will be limited.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nSection 404(a) (\u201cSection 404\u201d) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. Our management believes our internal controls are effective, and our independent auditors have attested that the operation of our internal controls was effective as of December 31, 2018; however, there can be no assurance that management and our independent auditors will be able to make similar reports in the future.\nIf in the future we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources and could materially adversely affect our stock price. Additionally, we would be unable to issue securities in the public markets through the use of a shelf\nregistration if we are not in compliance with Section 404. Furthermore, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price and could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nOur employees, agents, contractors, and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could adversely affect our reputation and our business, operating results and financial conditions.\nAlthough have adopted a Code of Conduct, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees, agents, contractors, and consultants, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure comply with applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation, in the areas of healthcare, trade restrictions and sanctions, environmental, competition, intellectual property, privacy, anti-bribery, fraud and abuse, pricing, insider trading and employment. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by our employees, agents, contractors, and consultants could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials. Misconduct by employees, agents, contractors, and consultants could violate such laws or regulations and any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, and monetary and injunctive penalties, and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, operating results and our reputation.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to pursue the development and commercialization of certain of our products depends upon the continuation of certain licenses.\nWe rely on certain licenses to certain patent rights and proprietary technology from third parties that are important or necessary to the development of our technology and products.\nBaxdela. Our license agreement with Wakunaga Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. provides us with a worldwide exclusive license to develop and sell Baxdela. In particular, we obtained an exclusive license to certain patents, patent applications and proprietary information, including patents and proprietary information owned by AbbVie Inc. and licensed to Wakunaga, covering the composition of matter to Baxdela, its manufacturing process, salt forms, pharmaceutical compositions containing Baxdela, methods of using Baxdela, and other proprietary information. Our license agreement with Wakunaga further grants us non-exclusive rights to other patents and applications. The license requires us to make certain milestone and royalty payments to Wakunaga. If we are unable to make any of these required payments under the license agreement, or if we do not use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain development and commercialization milestones for Baxdela within the timeframes required by the license agreement, our rights to develop and commercialize Baxdela could be terminated. In addition, Wakunaga may terminate the license agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis based upon our material breach of the license agreement if not cured within 90 days from written notice of breach. If our license agreement with Wakunaga were terminated, we would lose our rights to develop and commercialize Baxdela, and would have to grant Wakunaga a perpetual, non-royalty bearing, exclusive license to our proprietary information reasonably necessary to commercialize Baxdela. Loss of our license agreement would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and future prospects.\nOrbactiv. As a result of the IDB Transaction, we are a party to a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (\u201cEli Lilly\u201d). Under the terms of the agreement, we have exclusive worldwide rights to patents and other intellectual property related to Orbactiv and other compounds claimed in the licensed patent rights. We are required to make payments to Eli Lilly upon reaching specified regulatory and sales milestones. In addition, we are obligated to pay royalties based on net sales of products containing Orbactiv or the other compounds in any jurisdiction in which we hold license rights to a valid patent. The royalty rate due to Eli Lilly on sales increases as annual sales of these products increase. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain regulatory approval for Orbactiv in the United States and to commercialize Orbactiv in the United States. If we breach that obligation, Eli Lilly may terminate our license in the United States, license rights to Orbactiv could revert to Eli Lilly and we would lose our rights to develop and commercialize Orbactiv. The license rights under the agreement remain in force, on a country-by-country basis, until there is no valid patent in such country and our obligation to pay royalties ceases in that country. Either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other party. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party\u2019s insolvency or bankruptcy.\nIn addition, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our technology and processes infringe on or misappropriate the intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights under the license agreement;\n\u2022\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u2022\nthe payment of royalty fees, milestones or other costs under the license agreements; and\n\u2022\nthe priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligation under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to our products and product candidates are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent position as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for current and any future products in the United States and other countries. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain. The legal principles applicable to patents are in transition due to changing court precedent and legislative action and we cannot assure you that the historical legal standards surrounding questions of validity will continue to be applied or that current defenses relating to issued patents in these fields will be sufficient in the future. Changes in patent laws in the United States such as the America Invents Act of 2011 may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings which may be brought by us related to our patent rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nThese risks include the possibility that:\n\u2022\nthe patent applications that we licensed or have filed on our own may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries;\n\u2022\npatents issued or licensed to us or our partners may be challenged, discovered to have been issued on the basis of insufficient or incorrect information and/or held to be invalid or unenforceable;\n\u2022\nthe scope of any patent protection may be too narrow to exclude other competitors from developing or designing around these patents;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors were not the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors were not the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to comply with procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process, which can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights;\n\u2022\nfuture product candidates may not be patentable;\n\u2022\nothers will claim rights or ownership with regard to patents and other proprietary rights which we hold or license;\n\u2022\ndelays in development, testing, clinical trials and regulatory review may reduce the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection; and\n\u2022\nwe may fail to timely apply for patents on our technologies, products or product candidates.\nWhile we apply for patents covering both our technologies, products, and our potential products, as we deem appropriate, many biopharmaceutical companies and university and research institutions already have filed patent applications or have received patents in our areas of product development. These entities\u2019 applications, patents and other intellectual property rights may conflict with patent applications to which we have rights and could prevent us from obtaining patents or could call into question the validity of any of our patents, if issued, or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture or commercialize antibiotic candidates. In addition, if third parties file patent applications in the technologies that\nalso claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference, derivation or other proceedings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) or applicable foreign patent regulatory authorities, as applicable, to determine our rights in the invention, which may be time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, issued patents may be challenged during post-grant proceedings brought by a third party or the USPTO, or in foreign countries, or in the courts. These proceedings may result in loss of patent claims or adverse changes to the scope of the claims. Patent applications may also be challenged during pre-grant proceedings. If we are unsuccessful in defending any such opposition, only part of such patent would issue or the patent might not issue at all.\nIf we or our licensors or partners fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and product candidates, or our proprietary technologies and their uses, companies may be dissuaded from collaborating with us. In such event, our ability to commercialize our products and product candidates may be threatened, we could lose our competitive advantage and the competition we face could increase, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, litigation will be costly and time consuming and could prevent us or delay us from developing or commercializing our products and product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on our not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and not breaching any collaboration or other agreements we have entered into with regard to our technologies, products and product candidates. Numerous third-party U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending applications exist in the areas of antibacterial treatment, including compounds, formulations, treatment methods and synthetic processes that may be applied towards the synthesis of antibiotics. Although no legal action has been commenced or threatened against us by a third party for infringing intellectual property rights, we cannot provide assurances that we or our partners will be free to manufacture or market our product candidates as planned, or that we or our licensors\u2019 and partners\u2019 patents will not be opposed or litigated by third parties.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving intellectual property in the biopharmaceutical industry generally. If a third party asserts that we infringe its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, including:\n\u2022\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims, which would be costly and time consuming to defend, whether or not we are ultimately successful, which in turn could delay the regulatory approval process, consume our capital and divert management\u2019s attention from our business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial damages for past infringement, which we may have to pay if a court determines that our products, product candidates or technologies infringe a competitor\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our technologies, products or future products unless the third party licenses its patents or other proprietary rights to us on commercially reasonable terms, which it is not required to do;\n\u2022\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or lump sum payments or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights to obtain that license; and\n\u2022\nredesigning our products or product candidates so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nAlthough we are not currently party to any legal proceedings asserting infringement of third-party intellectual property, in the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies, processes or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or our partners or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. In addition, the outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. If we or our partners were to face infringement claims or challenges by third parties relating to our product candidates, an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to such third parties, and force us or our partners to curtail or cease the development of some or all of our products and product candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be required to file lawsuits or take other actions to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents, or those of our licensors, do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents, or those of our licensors, at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications, or those of our licensors, at risk of not issuing. Moreover, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, if securities analysts or investors perceive public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected. The occurrence of any of the above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of certain information, the value of our products and product candidates and technology could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. To protect this competitive position, we regularly enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with third parties, including employees, independent contractors, suppliers and collaborators. We cannot, however, ensure that these protective arrangements will be honored by third parties, and we may not have adequate remedies if these arrangements are breached. In addition, enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets, know-how and technological advancements is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. Non-U.S. courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect this information. Moreover, our trade secrets, know-how and technological advancements may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in a manner providing us with no practical recourse against the competing parties. If any such events were to occur, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have obtained trademark registrations with the USPTO for our marks, including \u201cMELINTA,\u201d \u201cMELINTA THERAPEUTICS,\u201d \u201cMELINTA THE ANTIBIOTICS COMPANY\u201d and \u201cBAXDELA\u201d for use in connection with our goods and services, and have filed a U.S. application for a BAXDELA logo mark. We also have filed and anticipate filing foreign trademark applications for the same marks for goods and services outside the United States, and have obtained registrations for some trademarks in jurisdictions outside the United States. The registrations will be subject to use and maintenance requirements. We may not register all of our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and it is also possible that there are names or symbols other than the foregoing that may be protectable marks for which we have not sought registration, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that opposition or cancellation proceedings will not be filed against our trademarks or that our trademarks would survive such proceedings.\nAs a result of the IDB Transaction, we have acquired trademarks and trademark applications filed with the USPTO or other jurisdictions for additional marks, including \u201cORBACTIV,\u201d \u201cTARGANTA,\u201d and \u201cVABOMERE,\u201d for use in connection with our goods and services. We have also acquired a license to the \u201cMINOCIN\u201d mark. The ORBACTIV and VABOMERE marks, and two VABOMERE logo marks, have matured to registration in the United States. We have also filed applications for an ORBACTIV logo mark. We also have filed and anticipate filing foreign trademark applications for the same marks for goods and services outside the United States, and have obtained registrations for some trademarks in jurisdictions outside the United States. The registrations will be subject to use and maintenance requirements. We may not register all of our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and it is also possible that there are names or symbols other than the foregoing that may be protectable marks for which we have not sought registration, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that opposition or cancellation proceedings will not be filed against our trademarks or that our trademarks would survive such proceedings.\nAny of our existing or future trademark applications in the United States and any other jurisdictions where we may file may not be allowed for registration, and registered trademarks may not be obtained, maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or proprietary information of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Such claims may lead to material costs for us, or an inability to protect or use valuable intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nMelinta\u2019s internal computer systems, or those of its CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of company operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, Melinta\u2019s internal computer systems and those of its CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage or disruption from computer viruses, software bugs, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication, equipment and electrical failures. While Melinta has not, to its knowledge, experienced any significant system failure or accident to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in its operations, it could result in a material disruption of its programs or operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for any of its product candidates could result in delays in its regulatory approval efforts, expose us to liability under certain data privacy lapses, and significantly increase its costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to its data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure or theft of confidential or proprietary information, Melinta could incur liability and its competitive position could be compromised.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and services that utilize the cloud computing environment and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nWe rely significantly on our information technology to effectively manage and maintain our clinical records, internal infrastructure systems and internal reports. Any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that infrastructure or security lapse of that technology, including cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, misappropriation of our confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. While our existing insurance for cybersecurity risks will help limit our losses, a breach in security, unauthorized access resulting in misappropriation, theft, or sabotage with respect to our proprietary and confidential information, including research or clinical data, could require significant capital investments to remediate and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur agreement with BARDA includes provisions that grant rights and remedies to the U.S. government that, if incurred, may make it costlier and difficult for us to successfully market Vabomere and, in certain circumstances, may allow the government to seek title to the work performed under the BARDA agreement.\nIn February 2014, our subsidiary, Rempex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., entered into a cost-sharing agreement with BARDA to support the development of Vabomere, which includes provisions that reflect the U.S. government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts. These rights and remedies include powers of the government to claim rights to data, including intellectual property rights, developed under such contracts under certain circumstances. The government may also impose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such contracts. We may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using certain technologies funded by the government and developed by us related to Vabomere, and we may not be able to prohibit third-party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts. Failure to comply with provisions within the BARDA contract may make it costlier and difficult for us to successfully conduct our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur largest shareholder owns a significant percentage of our common stock and is able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval.\nAs of February 22, 2019, Vatera Capital Management LLC (\u201cVCM\u201d) beneficially owned (as determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the exchange Act) approximately 62% of our outstanding common stock, taking into account the funding of the initial $75 million of convertible loans under the Vatera Loan Agreement on an as-converted basis. In the event that Vatera acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Melinta common stock through conversion of all or a portion of its convertible loans or otherwise, VCM will be able to exert control over matters requiring approval by the stockholders. For example, VCM would be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of\nany merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. In addition, although Vatera and its affiliates can acquire 30% or more of Melinta common stock, upon exercise of the Vatera Convertible Loans or otherwise, without it being a change of control under the Deerfield Facility and the Vatera loan Agreement, in the event that a third party acquires from Vatera or otherwise shares of Melinta common stock and, as a result, beneficially owns 30% or more of the Melinta common stock, a \"change of control\" would occur under the Deerfield Facility and the Vatera Loan Agreement. As a result, the lenders under the Vatera Loan Agreement would have the right to seek repayment or convert their convertible loans, and the change of control would also constitute an Event of Default under the Deerfield Facility. This may prevent or discourage certain acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock, which could limit the opportunity for Melinta\u2019s stockholders to receive a premium for their shares and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. Accordingly, VCM's interests may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders.\nProvisions in the Vatera Loan Agreement and the Deerfield Facility may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to Melinta stockholders.\nCertain provisions in the Vatera Loan Agreement and the Deerfield Facility could have an adverse impact on a potential acquisition of the Company:\n\u2022\nIf Melinta enters into a transaction that constitutes a \u201cfundamental change\u201d under the Vatera Loan Agreement and a lender elects to convert the convertible loans thereunder in connection therewith, the Company may be required to increase the conversion rate depending on the then applicable Stock Price (as defined in the Vatera Loan Agreement). The substantial number of shares that are issuable upon conversion of the convertible loans under the Vatera Loan Agreement, in addition to the $74 million principal amount under the Deerfield Facility that is convertible into Melinta common stock, may negatively impact the per share price that a third party may be willing to pay for the Company.\n\u2022\nFurthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Vatera Loan Agreement), the lenders thereunder have the right to either convert the convertible loans (including at the \u201cfundamental change\u201d conversion price if the Change of Control also constitutes a \u201cfundamental change\u201d) or require payment in full at par plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n\u2022\nUpon a Change of Control (as defined in the Deerfield Facility), the lenders thereunder have the right to require payment in full at par plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThese and other provisions in the Vatera Loan Agreement and Deerfield Facility could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring the Company, or adversely impact the price that an acquirer is willing to pay, even when the acquisition may be favorable to Melinta stockholders.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nBecause we will need to raise additional capital to fund planned operating expenses, we may in the future sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. These future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding options, restricted stock units and warrants, may result in further dilution to investors, particularly if our stock price, like that of many other companies in the anti-infectives space in recent periods, remains depressed. Further, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our stockholders or result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to a putative securities class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits, which may require significant management time and attention and significant legal expenses and may result in unfavorable outcomes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, on November 3, 2017, Melinta merged with Cempra, Inc. in a business combination. Prior to the merger, on November 4, 2016, a securities class action lawsuit was commenced in the United States District Court, Middle District of North Carolina, Durham Division, naming Cempra, Inc. (now known as Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.) (for purposes of this and the following description of legal proceedings, \u201cCempra\u201d) and certain of Cempra\u2019s officers as defendants. Two substantially similar lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court, Middle District of North Carolina on November 22, 2016 and December 30, 2016, respectively. Pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, on July 6, 2017, the court consolidated the three lawsuits into a single action and appointed a lead plaintiff and co-lead counsel in the consolidated case. On August 16, 2017, the plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint. Plaintiff alleged violations of the Exchange Act in connection with allegedly false and misleading statements made by the defendants between July 7, 2015, and November 4, 2016 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). the plaintiff sought to represent a class comprised of purchasers of Cempra\u2019s common stock during the Class Period and sought damages, costs and expenses and such\nother relief as determined by the court. On September 29, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. After the motion to dismiss was fully briefed, the court heard oral arguments on July 24, 2018. On October 26, 2018, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss and dismissed the plaintiff's consolidated amended complaint in its entirety. On November 21, 2018, the plaintiff filed its notice of appeal to the Fourth Circuit. the appellant filed its opening brief and appendix on January 28, 2019, and the appellee filed its response brief on February 27, 2019. The appellant's reply is due on March 20, 2019. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and we intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously.\nOn December 21, 2016, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was commenced in the North Carolina Durham County Superior Court, naming certain of Cempra\u2019s former and current officers and directors as defendants and Cempra as a nominal defendant, and asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and corporate waste (the \u201cDecember 2016 Action\u201d). A substantially similar lawsuit was filed in the North Carolina Durham County Superior Court on February 16, 2017 (the \u201cFebruary 2017 Action\u201d). The complaints are based on similar allegations as asserted in the securities lawsuits described above, and seek unspecified damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. Both cases were served and transferred to the North Carolina Business Court as mandatory complex business cases. The Business Court consolidated the February 2017 Action into the December 2016 Action and appointed counsel for the plaintiff in the December 2016 Action as lead counsel. On July 6, 2017, the court stayed the action pending resolution of the putative securities class action. That stay was then lifted. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on December 29, 2017, and was required to file a further amended complaint by February 6, 2018. On February 6, 2018, the plaintiff filed his second amended complaint. On March 8, 2018, defendants filed their motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, stay plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint. On April 9, 2018, plaintiff filed his opposition to defendants\u2019 motion. Defendants\u2019 filed their reply on April 26, 2018. On June 27, 2018, the parties filed a joint stipulation and consent order to stay the case until (1) 30 days after a final order dismissing the putative securities class action appeal with prejudice is entered; or (2) the parties file a joint stipulation to terminate the stay in the event that a plaintiff in a subsequently filed derivative action makes similar allegations and does not agree to stay the proceedings on substantially the same terms. On June 29, 2018, the court entered an order staying the case pursuant to the joint stipulation, which expired by its term following entry of the court\u2019s dismissal order in the above putative securities class action. On November 29, 2018, the parties filed a second joint stipulation to continue the stay until (1) 30 days after the putative securities class action appeal and any appeals therefrom have been resolved; or (2) the parties file a joint stipulation to terminate the stay in the event that a plaintiff in a subsequently filed derivative action makes similar allegations and does not agree to a stay of proceedings on substantially the same terms. On November 30, 2018, the court entered an order staying the case pursuant to the second joint stipulation. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and we intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously.\nOn January 3, 2018, the plaintiff who commenced the February 2017 Action, which was subsequently consolidated into the December 2016 Action, transmitted to the Acting Chief Executive Officer of Cempra a litigation demand (the \u201cDemand\u201d). The Demand requested that Cempra\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) \u201ccommence an independent investigation into the matters raised\u201d in the complaint filed in the February 2017 Action and the Demand, \u201ctake any and all appropriate steps for Cempra to recover, through litigation if necessary, the damages proximately caused by the directors' and officers' alleged breaches of fiduciary duty,\u201d and \u201cimplement corporate governance enhancements to prevent recurrence of the alleged wrongdoing.\u201d The Board has not yet formally responded to the Demand.\nOn July 31, 2017, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was commenced in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, naming certain of Cempra\u2019s former and current officers and directors as defendants and Cempra as nominal defendant, and asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and corporate waste. The complaint is based on similar allegations as asserted in the putative securities class action described above, and seeks unspecified damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. On October 23, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, stay, the complaint, which was supported by an opening brief filed on November 9, 2017. On January 8, 2018, the plaintiff filed his answering brief in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion. The defendants filed their reply in support of their motion on February 7, 2018. On June 18, 2018, the parties filed a joint letter (1) indicating they have agreed to stay the case until the pending motion to dismiss in the November 4, 2016 consolidated federal securities action pending in the United States District Court, Middle District of North Carolina, Durham Division is decided; and (2) requesting that the June 22, 2018 oral argument scheduled for defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss be canceled. On June 27, 2018, the parties filed a stipulation and proposed order to stay the case. On June 28, 2018, the court granted the proposed order and stayed the case on such terms, which expired by its term following entry of the court\u2019s dismissal order in the above putative securities class action. On November 28, 2018, the parties filed a second stipulation and proposed order to stay the case, including all discovery, until (1) 30 days after the putative securities class action appeal and any appeals therefrom are resolved, or (2) the parties file a joint stipulation to terminate the stay in the event that a plaintiff in a subsequently filed derivative action makes similar allegations and does not agree to a stay of proceedings on substantially the same terms. On November 30, 2018, the court granted the joint stipulation and proposed order and stayed the case on such terms. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and we intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously.\nOn September 15, 2017, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was commenced in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, Durham Division, naming certain of Cempra\u2019s former and current officers and directors as defendants and Cempra as nominal defendant, and asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of\ncontrol, gross mismanagement, corporate waste, and violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint is based on similar allegations as asserted in the putative securities class action described above, and seeks unspecified damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. On December 1, 2017, the parties filed a joint motion seeking to stay the shareholder derivative lawsuit pending resolution of the putative securities class action, which stipulation was ordered by the court on December 11, 2017. On December 11, 2018, the parties filed a joint status report indicating that they are in agreement that the case should remain stated pending the resolution of the putative securities class action appeal and any appeals therefrom. While we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend the cases, these lawsuits could divert management\u2019s attention from our ordinary business operations. Further, the outcome of these proceedings is difficult to predict and quantify, and the defense against the proceedings could be costly. The ultimate resolution of these cases could result in payments of monetary damages or other costs, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, or adversely affect our reputation, and consequently, could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have various insurance policies related to the risks associated with our business, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies. However, there is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or that our insurance carriers will cover all claims in that litigation. If we are not successful in our defense of the claims asserted in these cases and those claims are not covered by insurance or exceed our insurance coverage, we may have to pay damage awards, indemnify our officers from damage awards that may be entered against them and pay the costs and expenses incurred in defense of, or in any settlement of, such claims.\nIn addition, it is possible that similar lawsuits may be filed in the future in the same or other courts that name the same or additional defendants, in which case we could be similarly materially and adversely affected by such additional litigation.\nThe trading market for our common stock may not provide our shareholders with adequate liquidity.\nOur common stock has at times been thinly traded and may be so again. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained. You may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our common stock is not active.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors. In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market and the stock of biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital shares. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support our operations and finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition, under our credit agreement with Deerfield, we are prohibited from declaring or paying any cash dividends. Any future determination related to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if an acquisition would benefit our shareholders, and could also make it more difficult to remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimiting the removal of directors by the shareholders;\n\u2022\ncreating a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting shareholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting of shareholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at shareholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested shareholder for a period of three years following the date on which the shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless such transactions are approved by the board of directors. This provision could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our shareholders. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13263, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "MLNTQ"}
