Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions, or changes in other factors affecting such forward-looking statements.\nAvailable Information\nApplied Energetics, Inc. makes available free of charge on its website at www.appliedenergetics.com its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practical after electronically filing or furnishing such material to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).\nThis report may be read or copied at the SEC\u2019s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549 or at www.sec.gov. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.\nGeneral\nApplied Energetics, Inc. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our executive office is located at 2480 W Ruthrauff Road, Suite 140 Q, Tucson, Arizona, 85705 and our telephone number is (520) 628-7415.\nThe company is a \u201cshell company\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As of October 3, 2014, the company suspended its previous business activities.\nThe company is planning to reactivate its previous business activities pursuant to Teaming and Consulting Agreements with Applied Optical Sciences, Inc. (\u201cAOS\u201d) and Dr. Stephen W. McCahon, Ph.D., one of the company\u2019s founders and owner of AOS who was primarily responsible for development of the Company\u2019s existing Intellectual Property portfolio (collectively the \u201cConsultants\u201d). The company owns intellectual property that is integral and necessary for the development of Laser Guided Energy and Direct Discharge Electrical products for military and commercial uses (the \u201cProducts\u201d) and the Consultants have the facilities and technical knowhow to utilize the company\u2019s intellectual property in the development of the Products; and the Parties have agreed to cooperate in the proposal and fulfillment of research and development contracts for branches of the Department of Defense, agencies of the Federal Government and other Defense contractors and in other research and development activities relating to lasers. We intend to develop the next generation of Ultra-Short Pulse Lasers (\u201cUPS\u201d). We are preparing for the next stage of LGE development that involves the development of Advanced USP Laser Technologies. These lasers will allow for LGE weapon systems to be mounted on mobile platforms for multiple Anti-Terrorist missions including Counter Measures Against Drones and other Hostile Inbound Objects, Counter-Improvised Explosive Devices (\u201cC-IED\u201d), Vehicle Stopping, and many others. Importantly, the highly advanced USP Laser technologies required for successful LGE deployment leads to many new and unique laser opportunities in both commercial, medical, and military markets. Our goal is to increase the range and power and to decrease the size weight and cost of ultra-short pulse lasers. We expect to develop very high energy and power scaling ultra-short pulse lasers that have a very broad range of applicability for Department of Defense, commercial and medical applications. We are in discussions with and expect to team with a major Defense Contractor for co-development and manufacture of military products. We will also team with a leading commercial laser technology manufacturer for co-development of commercial products resulting from our research and development efforts.\nIf the reactivation of our former business is successful we will no longer be a \u201cshell Company\u201d but will be classified as a Development Stage Company until we achieve significant revenues from our reactivated business.\nThe U.S. Government has significantly reduced defense spending over the past few years and we have not received any meaningful additional Government funding in 2014 and 2015. We have completed all of our Government contracts and do not have any funded Government contracts for future work. There is no assurance that the Company and its Consultants will obtain meaningful Government Funding.\nEmployees\nAs of March 29, 2016, we had no employees, and we retain a consultant who is paid on an hourly basis.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFuture results of operations of Applied Energetics involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect future operating results and cash flows and cause actual results to vary materially from historical results include, but are not limited to those risks set forth below:\nRisk Related to Our Company\nWe have entered into a Teaming Agreement with Applied Optical Sciences, Inc. and a Consulting Agreement with Stephen W. McCahon (collectively \u201cthe Consultants\u201d) with the expectation of reactivating our former businesses are exploring strategic alternatives which may change the nature of our business.\nBecause of the lack of government funding in 2014 and 2015, we have significantly reduced our work force and will have to rely on the consultants for processing and fulfillment of any Government or commercial contracts. There is no assurance that the Company and Consultants will be successful in procuring Government and/or commercial contracts for its reactivated business.\nOur independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\nIn their report accompanying our financial statements, our independent auditors stated that our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern, and that they have substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our auditors have noted that our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flow from operations and the concern that we may incur additional losses due to the reduction in Government contract activity raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisk Related to Our Previous Business Activities\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to sustain the value of such assets.\nProtecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our ability to maintain the value of our intellectual property. We hold a number of United States patents and patent applications, as well as trademark, and registrations which are necessary and contribute significantly to the preservation of our competitive position in the market. There can be no assurance that any of these patents or future patent applications and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. In some instances, we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others. In the future, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. While we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our former employees, and entered into nondisclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. These measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of similar technologies. Based on our current financial condition, we may not have the funds available to enforce and protect our intellectual properties.\nWe may face claims of infringement of proprietary rights.\nThere is a risk that a third party may claim our products and technologies infringe on their proprietary rights. Whether or not our products infringe on proprietary rights of third parties, infringement or invalidity claims may be asserted or prosecuted against us and we could incur significant expense in defending them. If any claims or actions are asserted against us, we may not have the funds necessary to defend against such claims. Our failure to do so could adversely affect the value of our intellectual property.\nWe are subject to the penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that require brokers to provide extensive disclosure to their customers prior to executing trades in penny stocks. These disclosure requirements may cause a reduction in the trading activity of our common stock, which in all likelihood would make it difficult for our stockholders to sell their securities.\nRule 3a51-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a minimum bid price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to a limited number of exceptions which are not available to us. This classification would severely and adversely affect any market liquidity for our common stock.\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the penny stock rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that that person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, sets forth:\n\u00b7 The basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u00b7 That the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nBecause of these regulations, broker-dealers may not wish to engage in the above-referenced necessary paperwork and disclosures and/or may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of selling stockholders or other holders to sell their shares in any secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our common stock, if and when our common stock becomes publicly traded. In addition, the liquidity for our common stock may decrease, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our common stock. Our common stock, in all probability, will be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future and our stockholders will, in all likelihood, find it difficult to sell their shares of common stock.\nA large number of shares of our common stock could be sold in the market in the near future, which could depress our stock price.\nAs of March 29, 2016, we had outstanding approximately 155 million shares of common stock. Approximately 92 million of our shares are currently freely trading without restriction under the Securities Act of 1933, having been held by their holders for over one year and are eligible for sale under Rule 144(k) of the Securities Act.\nProvisions of our corporate charter documents could delay or prevent change of control.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of \"blank check\" preferred stock without stockholder approval, in one or more series and to fix the dividend rights, terms, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms, liquidation preferences, and any other rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions applicable to each new series of preferred stock. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes, serving staggered three-year terms. At least two annual meetings, instead of one, will be required to effect a change in a majority of our board of directors. The designation of preferred stock in the future, the classification of our Board of Directors, its three classes and the rights agreement could make it difficult for third parties to gain control of our company, prevent or substantially delay a change in control, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, the holders of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock have a right to put their shares to the company for an amount equal to the liquidation preference of approximately $340,000 plus unpaid dividends (approximately $85,000 as of December 31, 2015), in the event of a change of control. Such right could hinder our ability to sell our assets or merge with another company.\nThe redemption and dividend provisions of our outstanding preferred stock are onerous due to our current financial condition.\nThe company has redeemed substantially all of its outstanding preferred stock. At March 29, 2016, 13,602 shares were outstanding with a liquidation preference of approximately $340,000 and unpaid dividends of $85,000. As of December 31, 2015, the liquidation preference of our outstanding preferred stock plus unpaid dividends thereon was approximately $425,000 which represents approximately 311% of our total assets. If an event occurs that would require us to redeem the preferred stock, we may not have the required cash to do so.\nIn addition, our annual dividend payment on the preferred stock is approximately $34,000, which will further deplete our cash or significantly dilute our common stockholders if we pay the dividend in shares of common stock. We have not paid the dividends commencing with the quarterly dividend due August 1, 2013 and, as a result, the dividend rate has increased to 10% per annum and will remain at that level until such failure no longer continues. Dividends in arrears as of February 28, 2016 was approximately $94,000. These terms may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or complete an acquisition.\nWe may require additional financing to maintain our reporting requirements and administrative expenses\nWe have no meaningful revenues and are dependent on our cash on hand to fund the costs associated with the reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other administrative costs associated with our corporate existence. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred net losses of $223,851, $718,826 and $1,417,420, respectively. General and administrative expenses include salaries, accounting fees other professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses. We do not expect to generate any revenues unless and until the commencement of business operations. In the event that our available funds prove to be insufficient, we will be required to seek additional financing. Our failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our ability to pay the accounting and other fees in order to continue to fulfill our reporting obligations and pursue our business plan. We do not have any arrangements with any bank or financial institution to secure additional financing and such financing may not be available on terms acceptable and in our best interests.\nManagement has broad discretion over the selection of our prospective business\nAny person who invests in our securities will do so without an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of our prospective business. As a result, investors will be entirely dependent on the broad discretion and judgment of management in connection with the selection of a prospective business. The business decisions made by our management may not be successful.\nStockholders may not receive disclosure or information regarding a prospective business\nAs of the date of this annual report, we have not yet identified any prospective business or industry in which we may seek to become involved and at present we have no information concerning any prospective business. Management is not required to and may not provide stockholders with disclosure or information regarding our prospective business opportunities. Moreover, a prospective business opportunity may not result in a benefit to stockholders or prove to be more favorable to stockholders than any other investment that may be made by shareholders and investors.\nWe have not specified an industry for new prospective business opportunities and accordingly risks associated with a specific business cannot be ascertained\nThere is no basis for stockholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of potential new business opportunities or the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate. To the extent that we effect a business combination with a financially unstable entity or an entity that is in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of revenues or income, we will become subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of that financially unstable company. In addition, to the extent that we effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high degree of risk, we will become subject to the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. A high level of risk frequently characterizes certain industries that experience rapid growth, including internet companies. Although management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular new prospective business or industry, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all such risks or that subsequent events may not alter the risks that we perceive at the time of the consummation of any new business opportunity.\nThere are many blank check companies for which we will compete to attract business opportunities\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from other entities seeking to pursue new business opportunities. Many of these entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying new prospective business opportunities. Many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Based upon our limited financial and personnel resources, we may lack the resources as compared to those of many of our potential competitors.\nWe are deemed a \u201cShell Company\u201d as such we are subject to additional reporting and disclosure requirements that may affect our short-term prospects to implement our business plan and could result in a loss of your entire investment.\nShell companies are prohibited from using a Form S-8 to register securities pursuant to employee compensation plans. However, the rules do not prevent us from registering securities pursuant to registration statements. Additionally, the rule regarding Form 8-K requires shell companies to provide more detailed disclosure upon completion of a transaction that causes it to cease being a shell company. We must file a current report on Form 8-K containing the information required pursuant to Regulation S-K and in a registration statement on Form 10, within four business days following completion of a transaction together with financial information of the private operating company. In order to assist the SEC in the identification of shell companies, we are also required to check a box on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K indicating that we are a shell company. To the extent that we are required to comply with additional disclosure because we are a shell company, we may be delayed in executing any mergers or acquiring other assets that would cause us to cease being a shell company.\nRestrictions on the reliance of rule 144 by shell companies or former shell companies\nHistorically, the SEC staff has taken the position that Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by companies that are, or previously were, blank check companies, like us. The SEC has codified and expanded this position in the amendments discussed above by prohibiting the use of Rule 144 for resale of securities issued by any shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or any issuer that has been at any time previously a shell company. The SEC has provided an important exception to this prohibition, however, if the following conditions are met:\n\u00b7 The issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;\n\u00b7 The issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;\n\u00b7 The issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current Reports on Form 8-K; and\n\u00b7 At least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive disclosure with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.\nAs a result, it is likely that pursuant to Rule 144, stockholders who receive our restricted securities in a business combination will not be able to sell our shares without registration until one year after we have completed the business combination.\nWe most likely will issue additional securities in conjunction with a business opportunity which will result in a dilution of present stockholder ownership\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 500,000,000 shares of common stock. As of March 29, 2016, we have 154,785,520 shares issued and outstanding. We may be expected to issue additional shares in connection with our pursuit of new business opportunities and new business operations. To the extent that additional shares of common stock are issued, our stockholders would experience dilution of their respective ownership interests. If we issue shares of common stock in connection with our intent to pursue new business opportunities, a change in control of our company is expected to occur. The issuance of additional shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, in the event that an active trading market commences", "PERMNO": 77443, "SIC": 3600, "TIC": "AERG"}
