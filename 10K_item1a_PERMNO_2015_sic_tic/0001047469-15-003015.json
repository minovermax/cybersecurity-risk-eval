The information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nOur business, operations, and financial condition are subject to various risks. In addition to historical information, the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains \"forward-looking\" statements about our future business and performance. Our actual operating results and financial performance may be very different from what we expect as of the date of this report. The risks below address some of the factors that may affect our future operating results and financial performance.\nWe have no proven or probable reserves.\nWe are currently in the exploration stage and have no proven or probable reserves, as those terms are defined by the SEC, on any of our properties, including the Montanore Project. The mineralized material identified to date in respect of the Montanore Project has not demonstrated economic viability and we cannot provide any assurance that mineral reserves with economic viability will be identified on that property.\nIn order to demonstrate the existence of proven or probable reserves under SEC guidelines, it would be necessary for the Company to advance the exploration of the Montanore Project by significant additional delineation drilling to demonstrate the existence of sufficient mineralized material with satisfactory continuity. If successful, the results of this drilling program would provide the basis for a feasibility study demonstrating with reasonable certainty that the mineralized material can be economically extracted and produced. We do not currently have sufficient data to support a feasibility study of the Montanore Project, and in order to perform the drilling to support such a feasibility study, we must first obtain the necessary permits to continue our exploration efforts. It is possible that, even if we obtain sufficient geologic data to support a feasibility study on the Montanore Project, the data will lead us to conclude that none of the identified mineral deposits can be economically and legally extracted or produced. If we cannot adequately confirm or discover any mineral reserves of precious metals on the Montanore property, we may not be able to generate any revenues.\nEven if we discover mineral reserves on the Montanore property in the future that can be economically developed, the initial capital costs associated with development and production of any reserves found is such that we might not be profitable for a significant time after the initiation of any development or production. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit once discovered is dependent on a number of factors beyond our control, including particular attributes of the deposit such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure, as well as metal prices. In addition, development of a project as significant as Montanore will likely require significant debt financing, the terms of which could contribute to a delay of profitability.\nWe will require additional financing which we may be unable to obtain, to continue our business through 2015 and to complete our exploratory drilling program at the Montanore Project.\nWe are an exploration stage mining company and currently do not have sufficient capital to continue our business activities as planned through 2015 or to fund the activities needed to establish the economic feasibility of the Montanore Project. We have approximately $3.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand as of December 31, 2014. We anticipate that our expenses in 2015 will be approximately $2.0 million for regulatory permitting activities and $3.3 million of general and administrative expenses, assuming that permitting is not completed until the end of 2015. We estimate that, following the completion of permitting, the costs of completing the exploratory drilling program will be approximately $20.0 to $25.0 million, plus general and administrative expenses during the period in which the drilling program is being conducted. Uncertainties surrounding the exploratory drilling program and, in particular, the permitting process could require the project to take longer and cause costs to increase. Our cash on hand will not be sufficient to continue our business through 2015 or to commence the exploratory drilling program and the bankable feasibility study, and additional financing will be required. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all, nor can we guarantee that we would be able to fund the activities required to continue our business or complete a bankable feasibility study. Additional equity funding could be dilutive to existing stockholders. If we fail to obtain the necessary financing when needed, we may not be able to continue our business or execute our planned activities and we may be forced to abandon exploration and development of, or to sell our interest in, the Montanore Project, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, results of operations and financial condition.\nEven if our exploration efforts at Montanore are successful, we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to develop the Montanore Project.\nIf our exploration efforts at Montanore are successful, a Preliminary Economic Assessment completed in November 2010 indicated that it would cost approximately $550.0 million in external financing to develop and construct the Montanore Project. If and when an updated estimate is completed, this amount could increase significantly. Sources of external financing could include bank borrowings, offtake financings, debt and equity offerings, or the sale of a portion of the Montanore Project. Even if a bankable feasibility study is completed, commodity prices, the then-current state of financial markets or other factors may make financing for the development of the Montanore Project unavailable. Financing has become significantly more difficult to obtain in the current market environment. There can be no assurance that we will commence production at Montanore or generate sufficient revenues to meet our obligations as they become due or obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all, and we may not be able to secure the financing necessary to begin or sustain production at the Montanore Project. If we cannot adequately finance our exploration of the Montanore property and its subsequent development, we will not be able to generate any revenues. In addition, should we incur significant losses in future periods, we may be unable to continue as a going concern, and realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in other than the normal course of business may be at amounts significantly different than those included in our periodic reports.\nWe may not be able to obtain permits required for development of the Montanore Project.\nIn the ordinary course of business, mining companies are required to seek governmental permits for expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations. We are required to obtain numerous permits for the Montanore Project. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits has been, and continues to be, a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. We have been engaged in renewing or pursuing permits since early 2005, and, under the most favorable timing, could have permits in place by the end of 2015. However, the process is controlled by the governmental agencies, and throughout the\npermitting process these agencies have repeatedly missed anticipated deadlines. Obtaining required permits for the Montanore Project has been and may continue to be more difficult due to its location within the Cabinet Wilderness Area, and its proximity to core habitat of certain protected species, including the grizzly bear and bull trout. In addition, a third party is seeking to permit another mining operation near the Montanore Project and the impact of that operation on the environment and on wildlife in the area was taken into consideration in our permitting determinations and has lengthened our permitting process and made those determinations more difficult. Private political groups purportedly dedicated to protection of the environment have been active in opposing permitting of projects in and near the Cabinet Wilderness Area and may take actions to oppose or delay the Montanore Project.\nMining projects require the evaluation of environmental impacts for air, water, vegetation, wildlife, cultural, historical, geological, geotechnical, geochemical, soil and socioeconomic conditions. Permits are required for, among other things, storm-water discharge; air quality; wetland disturbance; dam safety (for water storage and/or tailing storage); septic and sewage; and water rights appropriation, and compliance must be demonstrated with the Endangered Species Act and the National Historical Preservation Act. An EIS is required before we could commence mine development or mining activities. Baseline environmental conditions are the basis on which direct and indirect impacts of the Montanore Project are evaluated and based on which potential mitigation measures would be proposed. If the Montanore Project were found to significantly adversely impact the baseline conditions, we could incur significant additional costs to avoid or mitigate the adverse impact, and delays in the Montanore Project could result.\nThe duration and success of our efforts to re-permit are contingent upon many variables not within our control. There can be no assurance that we will obtain all necessary permits and, if obtained, that the permitting costs involved will not exceed available funds. Permitting costs through 2014 have totaled approximately $43.5 million, and it is possible that the costs and delays associated with the compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that we would be unable to raise sufficient funds to proceed with the further exploration, development or operation of a mine at the Montanore Project.\nWe have a history of losses and we expect losses to continue.\nAs an exploration stage company that has no production history, we have incurred losses since our inception and we expect to continue to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred losses of $6.5 million and $7.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had a deficit accumulated during the exploration stage of $85.1 million. There can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have no recent history of production.\nWe have no recent history of producing silver or other metals and the process of achieving production has many uncertainties. The development of the Montanore Project may require that we establish reserves. A Preliminary Economic Assessment completed in November 2010 indicated the project would require approximately $550.0 million of external financing to develop and construct the Montanore Project. If and when an updated estimate is completed, this amount could increase significantly. During this process, we would be subject to all of the risks associated with establishing a new mining operation and business enterprise. We may never successfully establish mining operations, and any operations may never achieve profitability.\nThe exploration of mineral properties is highly speculative in nature, involves substantial expenditures and is frequently non-productive.\nMineral exploration is highly speculative in nature and is frequently non-productive. Substantial expenditures are required to:\n\u2022 establish ore reserves through drilling and metallurgical and other testing techniques;\n\u2022 determine metal content and metallurgical recovery processes to extract metal from the ore; and\n\u2022 design mining and processing facilities.\nIf we establish ore reserves at the Montanore Project, we expect that it would be several additional years from that determination until production is possible. During this time, the economic feasibility of production could change as a result of changes in commodity prices, inflation or other issues. As a result of these uncertainties, there can be no assurance that our exploration programs will result in proven and probable reserves in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations at the Montanore Project or at any other exploration project.\nOperation of a mine at the Montanore site will depend on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees.\nIf our exploration efforts at the Montanore site are successful and we are able to raise the necessary external financing to develop and construct the Montanore Project, our ability to conduct mining operations will depend in part upon our ability to attract, compensate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including executive officers, managers, employees and other personnel knowledgeable about the mining business. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in areas near the Montanore Project, and the challenges in attracting and relocating qualified employees to the Montanore site may be considerable. If we are unable to hire and retain employees to operate the mine, any planned commencement of mining operations in the future would be delayed. Furthermore, increases in labor costs due to the competition for qualified employees and hiring employees represented by labor unions could render mining operations at Montanore uneconomical. Any such delays or any increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur future profitability, if any, and our ability to finance the development of the Montanore Project, will be affected by changes in the prices of metals.\nIf we establish reserves, our ability to obtain a favorable feasibility study for the Montanore Project and obtain financing for the development of a mine, as well as our profitability and long-term viability will depend, in large part, on the market prices of silver and copper. The market prices for these metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 global or regional consumption patterns;\n\u2022 supply of, and demand for, silver and copper;\n\u2022 speculative activities and producer hedging activities;\n\u2022 expectations for inflation;\n\u2022 political and economic conditions; and\n\u2022 supply of, and demand for, consumables required for production.\nThe aggregate effect of these factors on metals prices is impossible for us to predict. Future weakness in the global economy and decreases in metals prices could adversely affect our ability to finance the exploration and development of the Company's properties, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. There can be no\nassurance that metals prices will not decline. During the five-year period ended December 31, 2014, the high and low settlement prices for silver and copper were approximately $48.70 on May 2, 2011 and $15.14 on February 8, 2010 per ounce of silver and $4.62 on February 14, 2011 and $2.75 on June 7, 2010 per pound of copper.\nWe are subject to significant governmental regulations.\nOur operations and exploration and development activities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing various matters, including:\n\u2022 environmental protection;\n\u2022 management and use of toxic substances and explosives;\n\u2022 management of natural resources;\n\u2022 exploration and development of mines, production and post-closure reclamation;\n\u2022 taxation;\n\u2022 labor standards and occupational health and safety, including mine safety; and\n\u2022 historic and cultural preservation.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could result in us incurring significant expenditures. We may also be required to compensate private parties suffering loss or damage by reason of a breach of such laws, regulations or permitting requirements. It is also possible that future laws and regulations, or a more stringent enforcement of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of any future operations and delays in the exploration of our properties.\nChanges in mining or environmental laws could increase costs and impair our ability to develop our properties.\nFrom time to time the U.S. Congress may consider revisions in its mining and environmental laws. It remains unclear to what extent new legislation may affect existing mining claims or operations. The effect of any such revisions on our operations cannot be determined conclusively until such revision is enacted; however, such legislation could materially increase costs on properties located on federal lands, such as the Montanore property, and such revision could also impair our ability to develop the Montanore Project and to explore and develop other mineral projects.\nWe are subject to environmental risks.\nMineral exploration and mining is subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral exploration and production. Insurance against environmental risk (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of the disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production) is not generally available to us (or to other companies in the minerals industry) at a reasonable price. To the extent that we become subject to environmental liabilities, the satisfaction of those liabilities would reduce funds otherwise available to us and could have a material adverse effect on us. Laws and regulations intended to ensure the protection of the environment are constantly changing, and are generally becoming more restrictive.\nThe mining industry is intensely competitive.\nThe mining industry is intensely competitive. We may be at a competitive disadvantage because we must compete with other individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources, operational experience and technical capabilities than we do. Increased competition could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding or acquire suitable properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future.\nOur future success is subject to risks inherent in the mining industry.\nOur future mining operations, if any, would be subject to all of the hazards and risks normally incident to developing and operating mining properties. These risks include:\n\u2022 insufficient ore reserves;\n\u2022 fluctuations in metal prices and increase in production costs that may make mining of reserves uneconomic;\n\u2022 significant environmental and other regulatory restrictions;\n\u2022 labor disputes;\n\u2022 geological problems;\n\u2022 failure of underground stopes and/or surface dams;\n\u2022 force majeure events; and\n\u2022 the risk of injury to persons, property or the environment.\nWe have ongoing reclamation obligations on the Montanore Project properties.\nAlthough we have posted bonds with the State of Montana to cover expected future mine reclamation costs, there is no guarantee that the amount of these bonds will satisfy the environmental regulations and requirements in effect at the time of reclamation. Should government regulators determine that additional reclamation work is required, we may be required to fund this work, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nThe title to some of our properties may be uncertain or defective.\nAlthough the Montanore deposit is held by patented mining claims, a significant portion of our United States mineral and surface use rights consist of \"unpatented\" mining and millsite claims created and maintained in accordance with the U.S. General Mining Law of 1872, or the General Mining Law. Unpatented mining and millsite claims are unique U.S. property interests, and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented mining and millsite claims is often uncertain. This uncertainty arises, in part, out of the complex federal and state laws and regulations that supplement the General Mining Law. Also, unpatented mining and millsite claims and related rights, including rights to use the surface, are subject to possible challenges by third parties or contests by the federal government. The validity of an unpatented mining or millsite claim, in terms of both its location and its maintenance, is dependent on strict compliance with a complex body of federal and state statutory and decisional law. In addition, there are few public records that definitively control the issues of validity and ownership of unpatented mining and millsite claims. We have not filed a patent application for any of our unpatented mining and millsite claims that are located on federal public lands in the United States and, under current law and possible future legislation to change the General Mining Law, patents may not be available. The Company has obtained a title opinion on some of the patented mining claims covering the Montanore deposit, but not on all of its patented mining claims. The Company has not obtained title opinions on any of its unpatented mining or millsite claims.\nOur ability to conduct exploration, development, mining and related activities may also be impacted by administrative actions taken by federal agencies. With respect to unpatented millsites, for example, the ability to use millsites and their validity has been subject to greater uncertainty since 1997. In November of 1997, the Secretary of the Interior (appointed by President Clinton) approved a Solicitor's Opinion which concluded that the General Mining Law imposed a limitation that only a single five-acre millsite may be claimed or used in connection with each associated and valid unpatented or patented lode mining claim. Subsequently, however, on October 7, 2003, the new Secretary of the Interior (appointed by President Bush) approved an Opinion by the Deputy Solicitor which concluded that the mining laws do not impose a limitation that only a single five-acre millsite may be claimed in connection with each associated unpatented or patented lode mining claim. Current federal regulations do not include the millsite limitation. There can be no assurance, however, that the Department of the Interior will not seek to re-impose the millsite limitation at some point in the future.\nIn addition, in 2009, a consortium of environmental groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, and the USFS, asking the court to order the BLM and USFS to adopt the five-acre millsite limitation. That lawsuit also asks the court to order the BLM and the USFS to require mining claimants to pay fair market value for their use of the surface of federal lands where those claimants have not demonstrated the validity of their unpatented mining claims and millsites. If the plaintiffs in that lawsuit prevailed, that could have an adverse impact on our ability to use our unpatented millsites for facilities ancillary to our mining activities, and could significantly increase the cost of using federal lands at the Montanore Project for such ancillary facilities.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered a number of proposed amendments to the General Mining Law, as well as legislation that would make comprehensive changes to the law. Although no such legislation has been adopted to date, there can be no assurance that such legislation will not be adopted in the future. If adopted, such legislation, if it included concepts that have been part of previous legislative proposals, could, among other things, (i) adopt the millsite limitation discussed above, (ii) impose time limits on the effectiveness of plans of operation that may not coincide with mine life, (iii) impose more stringent environmental compliance and reclamation requirements, (iv) establish a mechanism that would allow states, localities and Native American tribes to petition for the withdrawal of identified tracts of federal land from the operation of the General Mining Law, (v) allow for administrative determinations that mining would not be allowed in situations where undue degradation of the federal lands in question could not be prevented, and (vi) impose royalties on silver and copper production or fees on tons of material moved from unpatented mining claims located on federal lands or impose fees on production or tons of material moved from patented mining claims. If adopted, such legislation could have an adverse impact on earnings from our operations, could reduce estimates of any reserves we may establish and could curtail our future exploration and development activity on federal lands or patented claims.\nWhile we do not believe that title to any of our properties is defective, title to mining properties is subject to potential claims by third parties claiming an interest in them. For example, in September 2007, we filed a declaratory judgment action, Mines Management, Inc., Newhi, Inc. and Montanore Minerals Corp. v. Tracie Fus et al., Cause No. DV 07-248 in Montana Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Lincoln County. In this action we sought a Court judgment against certain of the defendants that the unpatented mining claims of such defendants allegedly located above portions of our adit and overlapping certain of our patented and unpatented mining claims, mill sites and tunnel sites are invalid. The defendants then asserted trespass claims against us relating to our use of certain of our mining claims, millsites and the adit. The parties participated in a mediation in 2009 which resulted in a settlement with seven of the ten defendants. In mid-March 2013 the Court issued an order\n(i) enforcing the settlement with seven of the ten defendants, (ii) enjoining us from trespassing on certain mining claims owned by one of the defendants, and (iii) finding that the mining claim of another defendant is valid and superior to certain of our claims. The claims with respect to which we were enjoined from trespass do not overlap the adit. The mining claim that the Court determined was valid and superior to certain of our claims overlaps portions of the adit and portions of certain of our patented claims and unpatented mill sites and tunnel sites. We do not believe that this order affects our ability to use the adit or to conduct exploration and development operations as currently planned once we have obtained the required permits. See further details regarding this action under \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\".\nWe are obligated by a right of first refusal agreement relating to our future silver production that may affect the willingness of third parties to enter into silver purchase agreements with us.\nIn November 2007, we entered into a Right of First Refusal agreement with a significant stockholder that granted to that stockholder a 20-year right of first proposal and a right to match third-party proposals to purchase a silver stream, i.e. all or any portion of silver mined, produced or recovered by us in the State of Montana. The right does not apply to trade sales and spot sales in the ordinary course of business or forward sales. The existence of this agreement may make other potential buyers less likely to negotiate with us to purchase silver we produce since they would be subject to this right of first refusal.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to volatility and could decline significantly.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT LLC (\"NYSE MKT\") and the Toronto Stock Exchange, or TSX. Securities of small-cap companies such as ours have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved. These factors include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. This volatility has been exacerbated in recent years because of global economic and political disruptions and natural disasters. Our share price is also likely to be significantly affected by short-term changes in silver and copper prices or in our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports. Over the last three years, the closing price of our common shares as reported on the NYSE MKT has fluctuated from a low of $0.47 per share to a high of $2.20 per share. Other factors unrelated to our performance that could have an effect on the price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022 volatility in metal prices;\n\u2022 the extent of analyst coverage available to investors concerning our business is limited because investment banks with research capabilities do not typically follow our securities or the securities of other exploration or developmental companies;\n\u2022 the trading volume and general market interest in our securities could affect an investor's ability to trade significant numbers of shares of our common stock;\n\u2022 the relatively small size of our public float limits the ability of some institutions to invest in our securities;\n\u2022 a substantial decline in our stock price that persists for a significant period of time could cause our securities to be delisted from the NYSE MKT and the TSX, further reducing market liquidity; and\n\u2022 news reports relating to trends in our industry or general economic conditions.\nAs a result of any of these factors, the market price of our common stock at any given point in time might not accurately reflect our long-term value. Securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert management's attention and resources.\nOur shareholders are subject to future dilution by the conversion of shares of preferred stock to shares of common stock, the exercise of options and warrants, and the existence of a significant number of options which could depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there were (i) 29,814,040 shares of common stock outstanding; (ii) 3,526 Series B 6% Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding immediately convertible into 4,482,584 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.7866 per share, and (iii) warrants outstanding to purchase 2,542,588 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.0816 per share. As of that date, there were options outstanding to purchase up to 4,876,000 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.31 per share. As of March 30, 2015, there are 1,506,000 additional shares of common stock (494,000 in the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, and 1,012,000 in the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan) available for issuance under our stock option plans. If we issue additional options or warrants, or if currently outstanding options to purchase our common stock are exercised, the investments of our shareholders would be further diluted. In addition, the potential for exercise of a significant number of options can have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock.\nThe issuance of additional common or convertible preferred stock may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have issued equity securities in the past, most recently in July 2014, and may continue to issue equity securities to finance our activities in the future, including to finance future acquisitions, or as consideration for acquisitions of businesses or assets. In addition, outstanding options to purchase our common stock may be exercised and additional options and warrants may be issued, resulting in the issuance of additional shares of common stock. The issuance by us of additional shares of common or convertible preferred stock would result in dilution to our stockholders, and even the perception that such an issuance may occur could have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and under Idaho law may enable our incumbent management to retain control of us and discourage or prevent a change of control that may be beneficial to our shareholders.\nCertain provisions of the Company's articles of incorporation and bylaws and of Idaho law could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change of control that shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of common stock in the Company. Specifically, the Company's articles of incorporation divide the board of directors into three classes having staggered terms of office. This may prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove management. The Company has also implemented a shareholders rights plan which would substantially reduce or eliminate the expected economic benefit to an acquirer from acquiring us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors. In addition, our board of directors is able to issue a new series of preferred stock from time to time without stockholder approval that could affect the voting power of our common stock and have dividend and liquidation preferences that could negatively affect the value of our common stock. These and other impediments to a third party acquisition or change of control could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Our board of directors has also approved employment agreements with certain of our executive officers that include change of control provisions that provide severance benefits in the event that their employment terminates\ninvoluntarily without cause or for good reason within twelve months after a change of control of the Company. These agreements could affect the consummation of and the terms of a third party acquisition. We are also subject to provisions of Idaho law that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company. One of these provisions prevents us from engaging in a business combination with any interested shareholder for a period of three years from the date the person becomes an interested shareholder, unless specified conditions are satisfied.\nThere are differences in U.S. and Canadian requirements for reporting of resources and mineralization, and we utilized the Canadian mining industry reporting standards for reporting of resources in our recent Preliminary Economic Assessment, or PEA. Some information required by Canadian reporting is not permitted under SEC guidelines.\nThe mineralized material figures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based upon estimates made by independent geologists. U.S. reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by SEC Industry Guide 7. Although we are a U.S. company traded on the NYSE MKT, we also report in Canada estimates of resources that are prepared in accordance with Canadian standards because we are also traded on the TSX and are thus subject to Canadian reporting requirements. These resource estimates were prepared in accordance with standards of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum referred to in Canadian National Instrument 43-101, commonly known as NI 43-101. In early 2011, we completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment, or PEA, that was prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 reporting standards. The reporting standards required by NI 43-101 are different from the standards permitted to report reserve and resource estimates in reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Accordingly, information concerning descriptions of mineralized material contained in our public filings with the SEC may not be comparable to information, including the PEA, that we file with Canadian securities authorities.\nUnder NI 43-101, we report in Canada measured, indicated and inferred resources, measurements which are not permitted in filings made with the SEC by issuers incorporated in the United States. Under SEC rules, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into reserves. Further, \"inferred resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. In accordance with Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources cannot form the basis of a feasibility study or other economic evaluations, but they were considered in the PEA. Accordingly, U.S. investors should not place undue reliance on the PEA, and should not assume that all or any part of measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category.\nAcquisitions and business integration issues will expose us to risks.\nWe may, in the future, engage in targeted acquisitions. Any acquisition that we make may change our business and operations, and may expose us to new geographic, political, operating, financial, governmental, environmental and geological risks. Our success in acquisition activities depends on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition and successfully integrate the acquired operations. Any acquisition would be accompanied by risks. We may expend considerable resources on pursuing an acquisition candidate, including due diligence and negotiations, and we may ultimately not prove successful in completing the acquisition. Even if successful in completing the acquisition, the acquisition may present problems. For example, there may be significant decreases in commodity prices after we have committed to complete the transaction and have established the purchase price or exchange ratio; a material ore body may prove to be below expectations; we may have difficulty integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any\nacquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; the integration of the acquired business or assets may disrupt our ongoing business and our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and contractors; and the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant. If we choose to use equity securities as consideration for such an acquisition, our existing stockholders may suffer substantial dilution. Alternatively, we could in the future choose to finance any such acquisition with then existing cash resources which could materially affect our liquidity and the availability of funds to invest in the Montanore Project. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisition.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on common stock and we intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. Any return on an investment in our common stock will come from the appreciation, if any, in the value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90069, "SIC": 1000, "TIC": "MGN"}
