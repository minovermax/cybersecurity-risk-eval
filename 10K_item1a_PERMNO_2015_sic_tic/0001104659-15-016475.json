Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nReaders and prospective investors in our securities should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report.\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Company\u2019s securities could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio.\nIn our business as a lender, we face the risk that borrowers may fail to pay their loans when due. If borrower defaults cause large aggregate losses, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, profitability and financial condition.\nWe attempt to mitigate the risks inherent in extending credit by adhering to specific underwriting practices, managed by credit professionals. Although we believe that our underwriting criteria is appropriate for the various kinds of loans we fund, we may incur losses on loans that meet our underwriting criteria, and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses. If our underwriting practices prove to be ineffective, we may incur losses in our loan portfolio, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reserves for loan losses may not be adequate.\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance which we refer to the allowance for loan losses. Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to address our actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. While this process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the forecasts and establishment of loan losses are dependent to a great extent on our subjective assessment based upon our experience and judgment. We can provide no assurance that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate to absorb actual losses in the future or that we will not be required to increase this allowance.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our loans and allowance for loan losses. While we believe that our allowance for loan losses is currently adequate to cover potential losses, we cannot guarantee that future increases to the allowance for loan losses may not be required by regulators or other third party loan review or financial audits.\nPoor economic conditions in the Northern California real estate market may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our loans and decreased value of the assets we hold as collateral.\nThe majority of our assets and deposits were generated in Northern California. At December 31, 2014, approximately 30% of our loan portfolio was secured by real property in Northern California. During 2014, the real estate market in Northern California continued to stabilize and improve as evidenced by increasing prices, increased transaction volume and decreased foreclosure rates. These improvements follow an extended period of deterioration and there is no certainty that improvements will continue, or that the region\u2019s real estate market will not deteriorate in the future. A deterioration may result in an increase in the level of our nonperforming loans, particularly commercial real estate loans. When real estate prices decline, the value of real estate collateral securing our loans is reduced. As a result, we may experience greater charge-offs and, similarly, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling\nthe real estate collateral may be diminished and, as a result, we are more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. Therefore, if there is a downturn in the Northern California real estate market or the region\u2019s economy generally, we could experience reduced income, increased expenses and less cash available for lending and other activities, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects.\nCompetition for qualified employees in the banking industry is intense, and there are limited numbers of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the California community banking industry. The process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing and business development and technical personnel, and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face limits on our ability to lend and the limitation may increase.\nOur legal lending limit to a single borrower and such borrower\u2019s related parties as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $29.5 million. Accordingly, the size of the loans which we can offer to potential customers is less than the size of loans which many of our competitors with larger lending limits can offer. Our lending limit may affect our ability to seek relationships with larger and more established businesses. We cannot be assured of any success in attracting or retaining customers seeking larger loans or that we can engage in participations of those loans on terms favorable to us. Moreover, to the extent that we incur losses and do not obtain additional capital, our lending limit, which depends upon the amount of our capital, will decrease, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket and Interest Rate Risks\nChanges in interest rates could reduce income and cash flow.\nOur income and cash flow depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investment securities, and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings (the \u201cinterest rate spread\u201d). We cannot control or prevent changes in the level of interest rates. Interest rates fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the FRB. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits and other liabilities. See \u201cItem 7a Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d Historically low market interest rates have caused our interest rate spread to decline significantly, which reduces potential revenue and net income. Sustained low levels of market interest rates will likely continue to put pressure on our profitability.\nAn unanticipated rapid decrease or increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our interest rate spread and therefore on the level of net interest income. For example, a rapid increase in interest rates in the future could result in our interest expense increasing faster than our interest income because of fixed rate loans or loans with interest rate caps and longer-term investment securities Although we take measures to limit interest rate risk, a material change in our interest rate spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial position.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, capital offerings and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that impact us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a reduction in the level of business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us, or a decrease in depositor or investor confidence in us. Further, as a business bank, a significant portion of our deposits are raised from companies in amounts that exceed levels covered by FDIC insurance. In addition, our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as the severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole as the recent turmoil faced by banking in the domestic and worldwide credit markets deteriorates.\nBecause a substantial portion of our customers are small and middle-market technology companies, our earnings will be particularly sensitive to market conditions in the technology sector, particularly in the Silicon Valley region of Northern California.\nA substantial portion of our customers are technology companies, including life sciences companies. Technology loans represented approximately 28% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2014. The strength of technology sector has historically fluctuated significantly and is subject to a variety of factors that we do not control, such as the markets for initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions and venture capital funding. A weakening in the technology sector could lead to higher loan default rates, a reduced demand for loans or both. In addition, we hold a portfolio of warrants from non-public technology and life science companies obtained when we originate loans to these companies. We record these warrants at fair value on a recurring basis. The values of the warrants and the potential to realize income from the warrants depends on the health of the technology sector, in particular the market for initial public offerings and mergers and acquisition. For all of these reasons, unfavorable market conditions in the technology sector could have a negative impact on our earnings and could cause us to incur losses.\nRisks Related to the Nature and Geographical Location of our Business\nOur operations are concentrated geographically in California, and poor economic conditions in California may cause us to incur losses.\nA majority of our business is located in California. Our financial condition and operating results will be subject to changes in economic conditions in California. A significant and prolonged downturn in the California economy could adversely affect financial institutions doing business in California, such as the Company. Economic conditions in California are subject to various uncertainties at this time, including the California state government\u2019s budgetary difficulties and the continuing drought. The Company will be subject to changes in economic conditions. We can provide no assurance that conditions in the California economy will not deteriorate in the future and that such deterioration will not adversely affect us.\nThe markets in which we operate are subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters.\nMost of our properties are located in California. Also, most of the real and personal properties securing our loans are located in California. California is a state which is experiencing a record drought and its prone to earthquakes, brush fires, flooding and other natural disasters. In addition to possibly sustaining damage to its own properties, if there is a major earthquake, flood or other natural disaster, we face the risk that many of our borrowers may experience uninsured property losses, or sustained job interruption and/or loss which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their loan obligations. Although we do not engage in agricultural lending, the drought in California could have an impact on the State\u2019s economy and our customers. Therefore, the continuing drought or a major earthquake, flood or other natural disaster in California could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSubstantial competition in the California banking market could adversely affect us.\nBanking is a highly competitive business. We compete actively for loan, deposit, and other financial services business primarily in California. Our competitors include a large number of state and national banks, thrift institutions and credit unions, as well as many financial and non-financial firms that offer services similar to those offered by us. Other competitors include large financial institutions that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources. Such large financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost than us, which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.\nRegulatory Risks\nRestrictions on dividends and other distributions could limit amounts that the Bank is able to pay to the Company.\nVarious statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends that the Bank can pay the Company without regulatory approval. In addition, if the Bank or any other subsidiary of ours were to liquidate, its creditors will be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of that subsidiary to satisfy their claims against it before the Company, as a holder of an equity interest in the subsidiary, will be entitled to receive any of the assets of the subsidiary.\nAdverse effects or changes in banking or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal or monetary policies could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to significant federal and state regulation and supervision, which is primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers and not for the benefit of investors. In the past, our business has been increasingly materially affected by these regulations. This trend is likely to continue in the future. Laws, regulations or policies, including accounting standards and interpretations currently affecting us and our subsidiaries, may change at any time. Regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations. During periods of economic stress, regulatory oversight can be expected to increase and regulatory agencies become more aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations. Such a regulatory response may effect, among other things, growth rates, business mix, capital levels and payment of dividends Therefore, our business may be adversely affected by any future changes in laws, regulations, policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement, including legislative and regulatory reactions to the recent credit crisis, acts of terrorism, and major U.S. corporate bankruptcies and reports of accounting irregularities at U.S. public companies.\nAs noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in July of 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates significantly increased supervisory activities and many new studies and regulations. We cannot predict what form additional regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Act might take or whether and when they could become effective.\nAdditionally, our business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB are (a) conducting open market operations in U.S. government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings by depository institutions, and (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The policies of the FRB may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSee \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Legislation and Proposed Changes\u201d for additional discussion regarding adverse effects of, or changes in, banking or other laws and regulations and governmental fiscal or monetary policies.\nSystems, Accounting and Internal Control Risks\nThe accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact operating results and financial condition.\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements. The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will impact our operating results and financial condition. See \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in this report and the information referred to in that discussion.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management and systems. We cannot assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately corrected. The occurrence of any such failures, interruptions or security breaches could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nOur management regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 89642, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BBNK"}
