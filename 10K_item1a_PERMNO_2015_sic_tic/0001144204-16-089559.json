{"cik": "776008", "company": "ROCK CREEK PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis section highlights specific risks that could affect our company and its business. Readers should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our company. However, the risks and uncertainties our company faces are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur, these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity. These events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nWe expect to have no product revenue in the foreseeable future.\nFrom product introduction to its exit from the market in August 2014, almost all of our revenue was derived from sales of our Anatabloc \u00ae dietary supplement. In December 2013, we received a warning letter from the FDA indicating that the dietary supplement product required the filing of a New Dietary Ingredient Notification to be legally marketed. In June 2014, we filed an NDIN with the FDA. On August 26, 2014, we received a response to our NDIN from the FDA. The response indicated that the FDA considers anatabine, a principal ingredient in these products, to be a drug, because anatabine was intended to provide anti-inflammatory support and was previously authorized for investigation as a new drug, and because anatabine is not a \u201cdietary ingredient\u201d within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act. Based on the FDA position, we permanently exited the dietary supplement business for anatabine in the U.S. Although we may continue to seek opportunities to license the product for overseas markets in accordance with applicable laws, we have substantially completed a transition to pharmaceutical product development. We anticipate that our future revenue, although none is expected for several years, will be highly dependent on the successful development and commercialization of one or more new pharmaceutical products. We currently do not have any pharmaceutical product candidates in the advanced development stage, and there can be no assurance that we will ever develop a product candidate that will generate revenue. Even if we successfully develop one or more product candidates, until, and unless, we receive approval from the FDA and/or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies, we will not be permitted to sell, and will not generate any revenue from, such drugs.\nWe are not currently profitable and might never become profitable.\nWe have a history of losses and expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future, and we might never achieve or maintain profitability. Our future prospects will be dependent on the successful development and commercialization of one or more new pharmaceutical products. We do not currently have any pharmaceutical products in the advanced development stage or on the market, and because it takes years to develop, test and obtain regulatory approval for pharmaceutical products before they can be sold, we likely will continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses were approximately $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $ 38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $309.9 million. Actual results will depend on a number of considerations, including:\n\u00b7 the pace and success of drug development activities;\n\u00b7 possible out-licensing of any product candidates we develop;\n\u00b7 obtaining regulatory approvals for any product candidates we develop;\n\u00b7 the pace of development of new intellectual property for any product candidates we develop;\n\u00b7 implementing additional internal systems and infrastructure;\n\u00b7 our ability to market and sell our existing products overseas; and\n\u00b7 changes in existing staffing levels.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and commercializing drugs with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including the development of product candidates, successful completion of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the preliminary stages of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenues that are large enough to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become or remain profitable could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations.\nWe may not be able to secure financing necessary to operate and grow our business.\nThe recurring losses generated by our operations continue to impose significant demands on our liquidity. Over the last several years, these demands have been met principally by private placements of our common stock, from the exercise of related warrants and stock options, and sales under our At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, Securities Purchase Agreements and issuance of Convertible Notes.\nIn 2014, we raised an aggregate of $13.8 million from such sources. In 2015, we raised an aggregate of approximately $1.0 million in private placements, $0.9 million from the sale of shares under an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with MLV & Co., LLC, and $3.4 million in a registered direct offering. In October 2015, we closed on a Private Placement of $20 million Senior Secured Convertible Notes, of which we have received $2.5 million in 2015 and the balance remained in restricted bank accounts. In 2016 we received an additional $1.0 million and subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain equity conditions, we expect to receive $1.0 million in April and on the 11th trading day of each successive calendar month.\nThe terms of the Notes issued in our recent financing transaction require us to maintain cash reserves, currently $12.5 million, securing our obligations under the Notes, and $3.5 million has been transferred to our unrestricted accounts and $4.0 million was used by us to pay amounts due under the Notes through March 2016. With respect to the remaining proceeds from the sale of our Notes, funds may only be released upon fulfillment of specific criteria. If we fail to meet certain equity conditions set forth in the Notes, we will not be eligible to reduce the cash reserves securing the Notes below $12.5 million nor may we make installment payments on the Notes in shares of our common stock. (See information included in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d pertaining to the Notes.) Even if we satisfy these conditions and continue to draw funds under the Notes, we will need to negotiate longer term payment plans with respect to various liabilities and outstanding obligations. Consequently, even after the completion of our recent financing transactions, we will seek additional funding to support our operations, whether through debt financing, additional equity offerings, strategic transactions (such as licensing or borrowing against intellectual property) or otherwise. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such additional funding on commercially favorable terms, if at all. If we do not raise sufficient funding, we may be forced to curtail our clinical trials and product development activities. Furthermore, if we are unable to raise additional capital (including through the exercise of outstanding warrants or through private placements of our securities, each of which has been a primary source of our financing in the past), our operations will be materially adversely affected, our scope of operations may need to be materially reduced, and our clinical trials may need to be delayed. Any equity financing will be dilutive to our existing stockholders. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for more information regarding these transactions\nWe are a party to various legal proceedings that have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, significant expenses to our company.\nWe have been a party to various legal proceedings, including a stockholder derivative action, a consumer class action, and an investor lawsuit. We have incurred substantial expenses (and related cash demands) in connection with these legal proceedings, and continue to incur expense. These expenses and cash demands may be material to our ability to pursue our development programs and fund our operations. While we expect that some of the cost related to the derivative action will be covered by insurance, we cannot provide any assurances with respect to ultimate cost of that action and/or that its associated costs (including indemnification obligations to former and existing officers and directors) will not materially exceed the limits of our insurance policies. With respect to pending legal actions, we anticipate that a material portion of the costs and expenses, as well as ultimate liabilities (if applicable), relating to those actions will not be covered by insurance. In view of the foregoing, the costs, expenses, and risk associated with the pending legal actions, together with our limited capital resources as described above, may have a material adverse effect on our business and development program by diverting resources that would otherwise be available for operations and development activities.\nOn May 20, 2015, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding Regarding Settlement (the \u201cMOU\u201d) with Jonnie R. Williams, our former Chief Executive Officer and director, providing for the manner in which indemnification payments will be made by us to law firms previously engaged by Mr. Williams. The MOU was entered into in furtherance of the settlement of our securities class action litigation, which settlement was approved on June 26, 2015. In general, the MOU addresses the manner in which we will satisfy Mr. Williams\u2019 indemnification rights for reimbursement of his legal expenses. The MOU stipulates that we will pay to two law firms engaged by Mr. Williams approximately $2.04 million, in the aggregate, over a two-year period, as follows: $300,000 was paid on May 29, 2015, with subsequent payments of $60,000 per month commencing on August 1, 2015 (subject to certain discounts for early payments of the balance due). If we do not complete additional financings to increase our working capital, we may not have sufficient funds to make all required payments pursuant to the MOU.\nGoing Concern\nAs a result of our current lack of financial liquidity, we and our auditors have expressed substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\nAs a result of our current lack of financial liquidity, our auditors\u2019 report for our 2015 financial statements, which is included as part of this report, contains a statement concerning our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d Our lack of sufficient liquidity could make it more difficult for us to secure additional financing or enter into strategic relationships on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and may materially and adversely affect the terms of any financing that we may obtain and our public stock price generally.\nOur continuation as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d is dependent upon, among other things, achieving positive cash flow from operations and, if necessary, augmenting such cash flow using external resources to satisfy our cash needs. Our plans to achieve positive cash flow include engaging in offerings of securities, negotiating upfront and milestone payments on our current and potential future product candidates or royalties from sales of our products that secure regulatory approval and any milestone payments associated with such approved products. These cash sources could, potentially, be supplemented by financing or other strategic agreements. However, we may be unable to achieve these goals or obtain required funding on commercially reasonable terms and therefore may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nRisks Related to our Pharmaceutical Business\nIn order to commercialize a therapeutic drug successfully, a product candidate must receive regulatory approval after the successful completion of clinical trials, which are long, complex and costly, have a high risk of failure and can be delayed, suspended or terminated at any time.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive government regulations related to development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization. The process of obtaining FDA, European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d), MHRA, and other regulatory approvals is costly, time-consuming, and uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. To receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in human patients to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product candidate. To date, we have obtained regulatory authorization to conduct Phase I clinical trials for several anatabine citrate-based drugs in the United Kingdom and have completed such studies, the results of which are currently being analyzed.\nIt may take years to complete the clinical development necessary to commercialize a drug, and delays or failure can occur at any stage, which may result in our inability to market and sell any products derived from any of our product candidates that are ultimately approved by the FDA, EMA, MHRA, or other foreign regulatory authorities. Our clinical trials, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or non-clinical testing. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of a new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d) to the FDA (or the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions), and even fewer are approved for commercialization. Interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict final results, and success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after promising results in earlier clinical trials. In addition, a clinical trial may be delayed, suspended or terminated by us or regulatory authorities due to a number of factors. Changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur or new information regarding the product candidate or the target indication may emerge, and we may need to perform additional, unanticipated non-clinical or clinical testing of our product candidates or amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Any additional unanticipated testing would add costs and could delay or result in the denial of regulatory approval for a product candidate. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to institutional review boards for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial.\nThere can be no assurance that an IND filed with the FDA in the U.S. will result in the actual initiation of clinical trials in the U.S. or that our products will ultimately be approved or achieve or maintain expected levels of market acceptance in the U.S.\nIn late 2013, we announced our intention to shift our focus to pharmaceutical products, given our belief in the potential for greater revenue growth through pharmaceutical product sales. However, we do not currently have any pharmaceutical products in the advanced development stage, and we will be required to file an IND related to any new pharmaceutical products we intend to introduce. While we filed an IND in the second quarter 2014, the filing was put on clinical hold until certain conditions were met. We withdrew the IND in August 2015, and in September we received an official letter from the FDA indicating that the action was completed. We intend to file an IND at a later date and later stage of development now that Phase I trials are complete in Europe. However, there is no guarantee that an IND filing will be accepted by the FDA.\nEven if we are able to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our new pharmaceutical products, generic or branded, the success of these products is dependent upon achieving and maintaining market acceptance. Commercializing products is time consuming, expensive and unpredictable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to, either by ourselves or in collaboration with partners or through licensees, successfully commercialize new products or gain market acceptance for such products. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to be approved or to reach the market or may have only limited or no commercial success.\nFurther, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on the regulatory status of the products or sales of the affected products. Accordingly, new data about our products (particularly as related to the anatabine compound), or products similar to our products, could negatively impact FDA approval of or demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal.\nAny drug products that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third party payers, and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u00b7 the efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the pricing of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7 the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u00b7 the strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u00b7 publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u00b7 sufficient third party insurance coverage or reimbursement.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate patients, the medical community, and third party payers on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by the conventional technologies marketed by our competitors.\nThe drug development business is very capital intensive, and our research and development efforts may be curtailed by our lack of available research funds.\nThe drug development business is very capital intensive, particularly for early stage companies that do not have significant off-setting revenues. Even if we are successful in gaining regulatory approval for all our preferred clinical studies, our product development initiatives will be substantially dependent on our ability to continue our research initiatives and to obtain the funding necessary to support these initiatives. Our inability to continue these initiatives and initiate new research and development efforts could result in a failure to develop new products or to improve upon existing products, which could have a material and adverse impact on our sales, operating income and cash flows.\nIf we are not successful in managing preclinical development activities and clinical trials, we might not be able to commercialize our products.\nWe have not obtained regulatory approval or commercialized any drug product candidates. Our limited experience might prevent us from successfully designing or implementing any clinical trials. If we are not successful in conducting and managing our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approvals, we might not be able to commercialize our developmental product candidates, or might be significantly delayed in doing so, which may materially harm our business.\nOur drug development program will depend upon third-party researchers who are outside our control.\nWe will depend upon independent clinical research organizations, investigators and other collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions, to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. These collaborators will not be our employees and we will not be able to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. They might not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs, if their performance is substandard or if the FDA, EMA, MHRA, or other regulatory body determines there are issues upon review of the study data, the approval of our regulatory applications, if any, and our introduction of new drugs, if any, will be delayed. If we cannot successfully enter into new agreements with outside collaborators on acceptable terms, or if we encounter disputes over or cannot renew or, if necessary, amend existing agreements, the development of our drug candidates could be delayed. These collaborators might also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which might compete with us. If our collaborators assist our competitors at our expense, our competitive position may be harmed.\nSee also \u201cRegulatory Risks\u201d below for additional risks related to our pharmaceutical business.\nRegulatory Risks\nIf we are not able to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals for any new pharmaceutical candidates we develop, we will not be able to commercialize such product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nAny pharmaceutical business and any pharmaceutical product candidates we develop are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries, including the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d). Failure to adhere to regulations set out by these bodies for one or more of our commercial products could prevent us from commercializing the product candidate in the jurisdiction of the regulatory authority. We have only limited experience in meeting the regulatory requirements incumbent on the sale of drugs in the United States and elsewhere. If we fail to adequately adhere to the regulations on drug sales, we may be unable to sell our products, which could have a material effect on our ability to generate revenue.\nAny product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries, including the EMA. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate in the jurisdiction of the regulatory authority. We have not obtained regulatory approval to market any drug product candidate in any jurisdiction.\nSecuring regulatory agency approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the regulatory agency for each therapeutic indication to establish a product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing regulatory agency approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and frequently inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory agency.\nIn addition, our future products may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nOur product candidates may fail to obtain regulatory approval for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 our failure to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulatory agency that a product candidate is safe and effective for a particular indication;\n\u00b7 the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the regulatory agency for approval;\n\u00b7 our inability to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks;\n\u00b7 our inability to demonstrate that a product candidate presents an advantage over existing therapies;\n\u00b7 the regulatory agency may disagree with the manner in which we interpret the data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the regulatory agency may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, quality procedures or manufacturing facilities of third party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical or commercial supplies; and\n\u00b7 a change in the approval policies or regulations of the regulatory agency or a change in the laws governing the approval process.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and non-United States regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. Any FDA or other regulatory approval of our product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn, including for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or if clinical or manufacturing problems follow initial marketing.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product brand names for sale in the U.S., and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely impact our business.\nA pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the U.S. or other countries until we have completed rigorous and extensive regulatory review processes, including approval of a brand name. Any brand names we intend to use for our product candidates in the U.S. will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product brand names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product brand name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product brand names, we may be required to adopt an alternative brand name for our product candidates. If we adopt an alternative brand name, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product brand name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nIf we are successful in obtaining approval for any drug candidates, we will be subject to various laws and regulations, including \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws and anti-bribery laws, and a failure to comply with such laws and regulations or prevail in any litigation related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nPharmaceutical companies have faced lawsuits and investigations pertaining to violations of health care \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other state and federal laws and regulations. We also face increasingly strict data privacy and security laws in the U.S. and in other countries, the violation of which could result in fines and other sanctions. The United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General recommends and, increasingly states, require pharmaceutical companies to have comprehensive compliance programs and to disclose certain payments made to healthcare providers or funds spent on marketing and promotion of drug products. If we are in violation of any of these requirements or any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines, exclusion from federal healthcare programs or other sanctions.\nThe FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in criminal or civil penalties or remedial measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization.\nUndesirable side effects caused by any pharmaceutical product candidates could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, and in turn prevent us from commercializing such product candidates and generating revenues from their sale.\nIn addition, if any product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product:\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may require the addition of restrictive labeling statements;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product; and\n\u00b7 we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product candidate, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale or adversely affect our reputation.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities, including European and other foreign regulatory bodies. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post marketing information and reports, registration requirements, current good manufacturing practice requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if we obtain regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We also may be subject to state laws and registration requirements covering the distribution of our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u00b7 restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7 warning letters;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u00b7 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u00b7 voluntary or mandatory recall;\n\u00b7 fines;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u00b7 product seizure or detentions;\n\u00b7 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u00b7 adverse publicity.\nIf we, or our suppliers, third party contractors, clinical investigators or collaborators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we or our collaborators may lose marketing approval for our products when and if any of them are approved, resulting in decreased revenue from milestones, product sales or royalties.\nOther Business Risks\nWe may lose our key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional personnel.\nOur future operations depend in large part on the efforts of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael J. Mullan, MBBS (MD), PhD. The loss of Dr. Mullan would have a serious negative impact on our business and operating results.\nOur future success also depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain, on a continuing basis, consulting services from highly qualified scientific, technical, management, financial and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development and operation of our business or that given the operating losses we have suffered over the past eleven years we will have the financial ability to do so. The loss of the services of key personnel or the termination of relationships with independent scientific and medical investigators could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe have experienced a significant change in the composition of our Board of Directors and senior management.\nOn December 27, 2013, Dr. Mullan became our Chief Executive Officer and Dr. Chapman became our President. In addition, on such date, our stockholders elected five new directors to our Board of Directors and three of our directors subsequently left office and two new directors have been added since then. On January 31, 2015, Park A. Dodd, III, our Chief Financial Officer, retired. At the same time, Benjamin M. Dent, an outside director and Chairman of the Audit Committee, resigned his board position to become our Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Operations. On June 9, 2015, Dr. Chapman resigned as our President and a director and Dr. Mullan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, assumed the role of President. On August 14, 2015, Mr. Dent resigned and William L. McMahon was appointed to replace Mr. Dent as interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Mr. McMahon was appointed Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary on November 23, 2015. The failure of our directors or any new members of management to perform effectively could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the transition to a pharmaceutical development company may take management a significant amount of time to fully implement. If our company\u2019s new pharmaceutical development strategy is unsuccessful or if we are unable to execute it successfully, there will likely be a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur future success will depend in part on obtaining patent and other intellectual property protection for the technology related to our products and product candidates, and on successfully defending our patents and other intellectual property against third-party challenges. In particular, this will include obtaining patent protection for the technology relating to the manufacture and uses of anatabine in our pharmaceutical product candidates.\nWe do not know whether we will obtain the patent protection we seek through our existing patents, patent applications that are pending or patent applications that we file in the future, or that the protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable, if challenged. If we fail to obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property, or if any protection we obtain is reduced or eliminated, others could use our intellectual property without compensating us, resulting in harm to our business. We may also determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily challenge a third party\u2019s products or patents in litigation or administrative proceedings, including patent interferences or reexaminations. In the event that we seek to enforce any of our owned or exclusively licensed patents against an infringing party, it is likely that the party defending the claim will seek to invalidate the patents we assert. If successful this could result in the loss of the entire patent or the relevant portion of our patent, which would not be limited to any particular party. Any litigation to enforce or defend our patent rights, even if we were to prevail, could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products without infringing any of our patents or other intellectual property rights, or may design around our proprietary technologies.\nUnited States patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings and United States patents may be subject to reexamination proceedings and other post-grant challenges in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d). Foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent offices, and those proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application, or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, reexamination and opposition proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may provide limited or no protection against competitors. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. If issued, they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology.\nWe may also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know-how to maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, suppliers and others. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached or terminated, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to significant product liability and other claims in the event that the use of our prior or future products causes, or is alleged to have caused, adverse effects. Furthermore, our products may cause, or may appear to have caused, adverse side effects (including death) or potentially dangerous drug interactions that we may not learn about or understand fully until the drug has been administered to patients for some time. The withdrawal of a product following complaints and/or incurring significant costs, including the requirement to pay substantial damages in personal injury cases or product liability cases, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nPrior to the introduction of Anatabloc\u00ae, our Anatabloc\u00ae Cosmetics and CigRx\u00ae, we obtained product liability insurance for these products as dietary supplements and as cosmetics. This insurance covers claims arising from product defects or claims arising out of the sale, distribution and marketing of our Anatabloc \u00ae, Anatabloc \u00ae cosmetics and CigRx \u00ae products. In 2014, a purported class action was filed with respect to the purchase of our Anatabloc \u00ae product. In that case, the plaintiff seeks a refund on behalf of all persons purchasing our dietary supplement on the basis that the product was not effective despite claims allegedly asserted by our company. We have been advised by our insurance carrier that the claims asserted in this case are not covered by our product liability insurance.\nWe are not, nor have we ever been, named as a defendant in any legal proceedings involving claims arising out of the sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising, marketing and claimed health effects relating to the use of our tobacco products. While we exited the tobacco business as of December 31, 2012, we could have claims asserted against us in connection with our prior manufacture and sale of such products. While we believe the risk of being named a defendant in such a lawsuit is relatively low, we could be named as a defendant in such litigation, as there has been a noteworthy increase in the number of these cases pending. Punitive damages, often in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions, or even billions of dollars, are asserted in a number of these cases in addition to compensatory and other damages. We currently do not have and do not believe that we can obtain insurance coverage for health-related claims arising from the use of tobacco products. If, in the future, we are named as a defendant in any actions related to our smoked or smokeless tobacco products, we will not have insurance coverage for damages relating to any such claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have had substantial obligations under state laws adopted under the Master Settlement Agreement.\nIn November 1998, 46 states and the District of Columbia (the \u201cSettling States\u201d) entered into the Master Settlement Agreement (\u201cMSA\u201d) to resolve litigation that had been instituted against the major tobacco manufacturers. We did not join the MSA but, while we manufactured and sold cigarette products, we were required to satisfy certain escrow obligations pursuant to statutes that the MSA required the Settling States to adopt in order for such states to receive the full benefits of the settlement. We discontinued the sale of any cigarette products in June 2007 and we sold the rights, title and interest in and to all income from and reversionary interest in our MSA escrow accounts in May 2007. Although we sold the rights in and to all income from and reversionary interest in the funds deposited into the MSA escrow accounts for sales through 2006, these MSA escrow funds remain in our name and the principal amount of these accounts will be available to satisfy portions of any state judgments or settlements for the type of claims asserted against the major tobacco manufacturers in the suits that resulted in the negotiation of the MSA, notwithstanding that we stopped selling cigarettes in 2007 and exited from the tobacco industry completely as of December 31, 2012. Moreover, if such claims are successfully asserted in litigation against us in the future, the claims could exceed the amounts that have been deposited into escrow under the MSA which could adversely affect our operating income and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe conversion of the Notes and the issuance of shares of our common stock in payment of principal and/or interest on the Notes could substantially dilute your investment and impede our ability to obtain additional financing.\nThe Notes (see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), which are convertible into shares of our common stock, give the holders of the Notes an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock such that conversion of the Notes will result in dilution of the equity interests of our other stockholders. We have no control over whether the holders will exercise their right to convert their Notes. In addition, the issuance of shares of our common stock, at our election, in payment of principal and/or interest on the Notes, will result in dilution of the equity interests of our other stockholders. We cannot predict the market price of our common stock at any future date, and therefore, cannot predict the applicable prices at which the Notes may be converted. In addition, the Notes are subject to anti-dilution adjustment provisions which, if triggered, may require the issuance of additional shares upon conversion. For these reasons, we are unable to accurately forecast or predict with any certainty the total amount of shares that may be issued under the Notes. The terms on which we may obtain additional financing may be adversely affected by the existence and potentially dilutive impact of the Notes.\nWe have many other potentially dilutive derivative securities outstanding and the issuance of these securities as well as future sales of our common stock could have a dilutive effect on current stockholders.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had outstanding options granted to directors, employees and consultants to purchase approximately 850,600 shares of our common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of $55.47 per share, of which options for 645,600 shares were exercisable at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015 we also had outstanding warrants exercisable for 2,752,541 shares of our common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of $8.85 per share. Exercise of outstanding stock options or warrants would cause dilution, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If we issue additional shares of our common stock for sale (which has historically been our principal means of financing our operations) in connection with future financings, our stockholders could experience further dilution.\nThe voting power and value of your investment could decline if our outstanding securities that are convertible or exercisable into shares of our common stock are converted or exercised.\nWe have issued a significant amount of securities that are convertible or exercisable into shares of our common stock, and the conversion or exercise of these securities could have a substantial negative impact on the price of our common stock and could result in a significant decrease in the value of your investment. The conversion or exercise prices applicable to some of our outstanding securities are subject to market-price protection that may cause the conversion or exercise prices to be reduced in the event of a decline in the market price of our common stock. In addition, the conversion or exercise prices of some of our outstanding securities are subject to downward anti-dilution adjustments, from time to time, if we issue securities at a purchase, exercise or conversion price that is less than the then-applicable conversion or exercise price of the applicable security. Consequently, the voting power and value of your investment in each of these events would decline if the securities are converted or exercised for shares of our common stock at lower prices as a result of the declining market price or if sales of our securities are made below the conversion or exercise prices of some of our securities.\nThe market-price protection features of our Notes could also allow the Notes to become convertible into a greatly increased number of additional shares of our common stock, particularly if a holder of a Note sequentially converts portions of its Note into shares of our common stock at alternate conversion prices and resells those shares into the market.\nThe market price of our common stock and the value of your investment could substantially decline if the Notes are converted into shares of our common stock or if we issue shares of our common stock in payment of principal and/or interest on the Notes and all of these shares of common stock are resold into the market, or if a perception exists that a substantial number of shares will be issued upon conversion of the Notes or upon the payment of principal and/or interest on the Notes and then resold into the market.\nIf the conversion price at which the Notes are converted into shares of common stock or the conversion price at which shares of common stock in payment of principal and/or interest on the Notes are issued are lower than the price at which you made your investment, immediate dilution of the value of your investment will occur. In addition, sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Notes, in lieu of cash payments of principal and/or interest on the Notes, or even the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, you could experience a substantial decline in the value of your investment as a result of both the actual and potential conversion of the Notes and the issuance of shares of common stock in lieu of cash payments of principal and/or interest on the Notes.\nNotice of delisting for failure to satisfy a continued listing rule or standard; Transfer of listing\nOn November 3, 2015, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market (\"NASDAQ\") stating that a NASDAQ Hearings Panel would delist our shares from NASDAQ effective at the open of business on Thursday, November 5, 2015. Our shares were delisted as a result of our failure to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2), which requires us to maintain a minimum \u201cMarket Value of Listed Securities\u201d of $35 million for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. The Panel\u2019s determination followed a hearing on October 29, 2015, at which we requested additional time to comply with Rule 5550(b)(2).\nWe did not request the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council review the Panel's decision. NASDAQ completed the delisting by filing a Form 25 Notification of Delisting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2016, after applicable appeal periods had lapsed.\nOur common stock began trading on the OTC Pink market under the ticker symbol \"RCPI\" effective at the open of the market on November 5, 2015. We applied for and received approval to trade on the OTCQB Venture Marketplace, under the ticker symbol \u201cRCPI\u201d beginning November 11, 2015. The OTCQB market is generally limited to companies that are subject to and current in Securities and Exchange Commission reporting obligations.\nA limited public trading market exists for our common stock, which makes it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their common stock in the public markets.\nOur common stock is currently traded under the symbol \u201cRCPI\u201d and frequently trades at a low volume, based on quotations on the OTCQB \u00ae Venture Marketplace trading platform operated by OTC Markets Group, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is still relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors, and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our stock until such time as we became more viable. Additionally, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in our securities. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our stock is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that trading levels will be sustained.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. We receive only limited attention from securities analysts and may experience an imbalance between supply and demand for our common stock resulting from our trading volumes. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 announcements of new products, technological innovations, contracts, acquisitions, financings, corporate partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 the approval by the FDA and/or other regulatory agencies of any new pharmaceutical products we develop;\n\u00b7 developments related to our patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 negative regulatory action or regulatory approval with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products; and\n\u00b7 market conditions in the pharmaceutical industry in general.\nThe stock market from time to time, and in particular over the last several years, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for small companies, and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance or prospects for future operations. These broad fluctuations may adversely impact the market price of our common stock. In addition, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price of our common stock.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that require that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, as a result, our investors\u2019 sole source of gain, if any, will depend on capital appreciation, if any.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. You should not invest in us if you require dividend income. Any income from an investment in us would only come from a rise in the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business and do not foresee payment of a dividend in any upcoming fiscal period. In addition, the terms of existing or any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our by-laws could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may result in an entrenchment of management and diminish the value of our common stock.\nOur by-laws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time by our Chairman of the Board, our President, a majority of our Board of Directors or by the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable. Such provisions could impede the ability of our common stockholders to benefit from a change of control and, as a result, could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and your ability to realize any potential change-in-control premium.", "PERMNO": 87816, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "RCPIQ"}
