The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on us. Additional risks and uncertainties also could adversely affect our business and results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of your common stock could decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.\nIf loan losses are greater than anticipated, our earnings may be adversely affected.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our credit risk with respect to our real estate and construction loan portfolio relates principally to the creditworthiness of individuals and the value of the real estate serving as security for the repayment of loans, and the credit risk with respect to our commercial and consumer loan portfolio relates principally to the general creditworthiness of businesses and individuals within the local markets in which we operate. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for potential loan losses based on a number of factors. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate. However, if estimates, assumptions or judgments used in calculating this allowance are incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual loan losses. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot be determined at this time and may vary from the amounts of past provisions. In addition, banking regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses, which may lead to an increase in our provision for loan losses or a recognition of further charge-offs if the regulators\u2019 judgments are different than those of our management. Material additions to the allowance could materially decrease our net income.\nDifficult economic and market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nEconomic recession or other economic problems, including those affecting our markets and regions, but also those affecting the national or world economy, could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services and the value of our loans and investments. Although economic conditions have improved since the conclusion of the last recession, economic growth has been slow and uneven. Further economic deterioration that affects household or corporate incomes could result in reduced demand for credit or fee-based products and services. Additionally, negative market developments could affect consumer confidence levels and cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which may impact our charge-offs and provisions for loan and credit losses. These conditions could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Conversely, we cannot provide any assurance that we would benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions, either in our primary market areas or nationally, even if they do occur.\nThe banking industry is highly competitive, which could result in loss of market share and adversely affect our business.\nWe encounter strong competition in making loans, acquiring deposits and attracting customers for investment services. We compete with commercial banks, online banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment banking companies, brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries operating in Alabama and elsewhere in various segments of the financial services market. Many of these competitors, some of which are affiliated with large bank holding companies, have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do. In addition, many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks, and, as a result, may be able to offer certain products and services at a lower cost than the we are able to offer, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and the costs of complying with such regulation could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state law. We are subject to the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the ASBD. These regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors, the public and the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund, and are not intended to protect shareholders. Additionally, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by other regulatory authorities, such as the SEC and state securities and insurance regulators. We are subject to changes in federal and state laws, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous change, and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Regulations and laws may be modified at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that could affect us. We cannot assure you that any changes in regulations or new laws will not adversely affect our performance or consolidated results of operations. Our regulatory framework is discussed in greater detail under \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nChanges to the deposit insurance assessment regime could increase our cost of holding deposits and thereby adversely affect our financial results.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act changed the method of calculation for FDIC insurance assessments. Under the previous system, the assessment base was domestic deposits minus certain allowable exclusions, such as pass-through reserve balances. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, assessments for any calculation period are based on the depository institution\u2019s average consolidated total assets, less its average amount of tangible equity, during that period. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement these changes. In addition to changing the assessment base, the final rule defines and limits certain assessment adjustments, such as those based on unsecured debt or brokered deposits. It also creates a new base assessment rate schedule in an attempt to provide more predictable assessment rates to insured financial institutions while collecting approximately the same amount of revenue as under the old rate schedule. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, and any significant increase in insurance assessments would likely have an adverse effect on us and thereby negatively impact our consolidated results of operations.\nThe cost of complying with the new consumer protection regulations and policies could adversely affect our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a new regulatory entity with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has extensive rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to banks and other types of lenders, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. It also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, like us, are examined for compliance with consumer protection laws by their primary bank regulators, but these regulators defer to the CFPB\u2019s rules and interpretations in evaluating a bank\u2019s compliance with consumer protection laws. Therefore, although the CFPB does not directly supervise us, the actions of the CFPB significantly impact our operations.\nThe CFPB has set forth numerous rules and guidance documents since its inception concerning a wide range of consumer protection laws, many of which are directly applicable to our operations. For example, the CFPB recently imposed new requirements regarding the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans, limitations on the manner in which loan originators may be compensated, mandatory disclosures on documentation given to borrowers, and an obligation on the part of lenders to verify a borrower\u2019s \u201cability to repay\u201d a residential mortgage loan before extending credit, among others. The CFPB likely will continue to make rules relating to consumer protection, and it is difficult to predict which of our products and services will be subject to these rules or how these rules will be implemented. However, compliance with CFPB regulations likely will result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRapid and significant changes in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance.\nMost of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and are therefore subject to significant risks from changes in interest rates. Our profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, and changes in interest rates can impact our net interest income as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities. Our consolidated results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates and our ability to manage interest rate risks. Changes in market interest rates, changes in the relationships between short-term and long-term market interest rates and changes in the relationships between different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. These differences could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income or a decrease in our interest rate spread. For a more detailed discussion of these risks and our management strategies for these risks, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Our net interest margin depends on many factors that are partly or completely out of our control, including competition, federal economic monetary and fiscal policies and general economic conditions. Despite the implementation of strategies to manage interest rate risks, changes in interest rates may have a material adverse impact on our profitability.\nThe performance of our investment portfolio is subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates and market conditions.\nChanges in interest rates can negatively affect the performance of most of our investments. Interest rate volatility can reduce gains or create losses in our investment portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates affect returns on, and the market value of, investment securities. The fair market value of the securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities also fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. The potential effect of these factors is heightened due to the current conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur consolidated results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve include open market operations in United States government securities, changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, particularly in light of the continuing threat of terrorist attacks, the current political unrest in the Middle East and eastern Europe and the volatile conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally, we cannot predict future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or our business and earnings. Furthermore, the actions of the United States government and other governments in responding to such conditions may result in currency fluctuations, exchange controls, market disruption and other adverse effects.\nOur profitability and liquidity may be affected by changes in economic conditions in the areas in which our operations and loans are concentrated.\nOur success depends to a certain extent on the general economic conditions of the geographic markets that we serve in Alabama and Mississippi. Local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on our commercial, real estate and construction loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Adverse changes in the economic conditions of the southeastern United States in general or any one or more of these local markets could negatively impact the financial results of our banking operations and have a negative effect on our profitability. For example, significant unemployment in the timber industry could cause widespread economic distress in many of the areas that we serve. Similar trends in other industries or sectors that we serve could have a significant negative effect on our profitability.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will pay dividends in the future.\nDividends from the Bank are Bancshares\u2019 primary source of funds for the payment of dividends to its shareholders, and there are various legal and regulatory limits regarding the extent to which the Bank may pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Bancshares. The ability of both the Bank and Bancshares to pay dividends will continue to be subject to and limited by the results of operations of the Bank and by certain legal and regulatory restrictions. Further, any lenders making loans to Bancshares or the Bank may impose financial covenants that may be more restrictive than the legal and regulatory requirements with respect to the payment of dividends. There can be no assurance as to whether or when Bancshares may pay dividends to its shareholders.\nExtreme weather could cause a disruption in our operations, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nSome of our operations are located in areas near the Gulf of Mexico, a region that is susceptible to hurricanes and other forms of extreme weather. Such weather events could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. Further, a hurricane, tornado or other extreme weather event in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely impact the value of collateral that we hold.\nTechnological changes in the banking and financial services industries may negatively impact our results of operations and our ability to compete.\nThe banking and financial services industries are undergoing rapid changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to enhancing the level of service provided to customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. To remain competitive, financial institutions must continuously evaluate changing customer preferences with respect to emerging technologies and develop plans to address such changes in the most cost-effective manner possible. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to use technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and create additional efficiencies in operations, and our failure to do so could negatively impact our business. Additionally, our competitors may have greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do, and we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, which could reduce our ability to effectively compete.\nOur information systems may experience a failure or interruption.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption in the operation of these systems could impair or prevent the effective operation of our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, lending, or other functions. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure or interruption in the operation of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions impacting our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe use information technology in our operations and offer online banking services to our customers, and unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 confidential or proprietary information as a result of a cyber-attack or otherwise could expose us to reputational harm and litigation and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. We are under continuous threat of loss due to hacking and cyber-attacks, especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize Internet and other remote channels to transact business. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to continue to provide Internet banking channels, and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers. Therefore, the secure processing, transmission, and storage of information in connection with our online banking services are critical elements of our operations. However, our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other malware, phishing schemes, or other security failures. In addition, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PCs, or other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems in order to access our products and services. Our technologies, systems and networks, and our customers\u2019 devices, may become the target of cyber-attacks, electronic fraud, or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary, and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against these threats or to alleviate or investigate problems caused by such threats. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the processing, storage, or transmission of confidential customer information, any breaches or unauthorized access to such information could present significant regulatory costs and expose us to litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent these types of security threats could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation and ability to generate deposits. While we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches to date, we may suffer such losses in the future. The occurrence of any cyber-attack or information security breach could result in potential legal liability, reputational harm, damage to our competitive position, and the disruption of our operations, all of which could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe depend on outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data.\nWe rely on software developed by third-party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits, loan and deposit processing, and securities portfolio accounting. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the applicable vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and perform our own testing of user controls, we must rely on the continued maintenance of controls by these third-party vendors, including safeguards over the security of customer data. In addition, we maintain, or contract with third parties to maintain, daily backups of key processing outputs in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems. Nonetheless, we may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct business or process transactions, or incur damage to our reputation, if the third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. Such a disruption or breach of security may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe internal controls that we have implemented to mitigate risks inherent to the business of banking might fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls and procedures that are designed to manage the various risks in our business, including credit risk, operational risk, financial risk, compliance risk, and interest rate risk. No system of controls, however well-designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. If such a system fails or is circumvented, there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSecurities issued by us, including our common stock, are not insured.\nSecurities issued by us, including our common stock, are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of any bank and are not insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund maintained by the FDIC or by any other governmental agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nFuture issuances of additional securities by us could result in dilution of your ownership.\nWe may decide from time to time to issue additional securities in order to raise capital, support growth or fund acquisitions. Further, we may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate employees. Such issuances of securities by us would dilute the respective ownership interests of our shareholders.\nOur common stock price could be volatile, which could result in losses for individual shareholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and business conditions;\n\u25cf\nchanging market conditions in the financial services industry;\n\u25cf\nmonetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations and other activities of the government, agencies and similar organizations;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nour failure to meet analyst predictions and projections;\n\u25cf\ncollectability of loans;\n\u25cf\ncost and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings, claims, settlements and judgments;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of innovations or new services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u25cf\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nDue to these factors, you may not be able to sell your stock at or above the price you paid for it, which could result in substantial losses.\nBancshares\u2019 liquidity is subject to various regulatory restrictions applicable to its subsidiaries.\nThere are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of Bancshares\u2019 subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to Bancshares. In addition, Bancshares\u2019 right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of its subsidiaries upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or otherwise will be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that any of Bancshares\u2019 claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized.\nOur performance and results of operations depend in part on the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine investment and banking transactions, as well as the quality and value of our investments in equity securities and obligations of other financial institutions, could be adversely affected by the actions, financial condition and profitability of such other financial institutions with which we transact, including, without limitation, the FHLBA and our correspondent banks. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of shared credits, trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor or counterparty confidence in certain institutions, and could lead to losses or defaults by other institutions. Any defaults by, or failures of, the institutions with whom we transact could adversely affect our debt and equity holdings in such other institutions, our participation interests in loans originated by other institutions, and our business, including our liquidity, financial condition and earnings.\nLiquidity risks could affect our operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the repayment or sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our funding sources include federal funds, purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements, core and non-core deposits, and short- and long-term debt. We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a source of liquidity. Other sources of liquidity are available should they be needed, such as through our acquisition of additional non-core deposits. Bancshares may be able, depending on market conditions, to issue and sell debt securities and preferred or common equity securities in public or private transactions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on acceptable terms could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as further disruption in the financial markets, negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry, deterioration within the credit markets, or the financial condition, liquidity or profitability of the financial institutions with which we transact.\nWe depend on the services of our management team and board of directors, and the unexpected loss of key officers or directors may adversely affect our operations.\nA departure of any of our executive officers, other key personnel, or directors could adversely affect our operations. The community involvement of our executive officers and directors and our directors\u2019 diverse and extensive local business relationships are important to our success. A material change in the composition of our management team or board of directors could cause our business to suffer.", "PERMNO": 88384, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FUSB"}
