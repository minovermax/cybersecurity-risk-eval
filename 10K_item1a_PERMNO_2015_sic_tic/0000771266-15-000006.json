{"cik": "771266", "company": "KOPIN CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nWe have experienced a history of losses and have a significant accumulated deficit. In addition we have had negative cash flow from operating activities in 2014 and 2013 and we expect to have negative cash flow from operating activities in 2015. Since inception, we have incurred significant net operating losses. As of December 27, 2014, we have an accumulated deficit of $175.9 million. At December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, we had $90.9 million and $112.7 million of cash and equivalents and marketable securities, respectively. The decline in our cash and equivalents and marketable securities is partially a result of our research and development investments in Wearable products. Our products are targeted towards the wearable market which we believe is still developing and our competitive strength is creating new technologies. Accordingly we believe it is important to continue to invest in research and development even during periods when we are not profitable. Our philosophy and strategies may result in our incurring losses from operations and negative cash flow.\nThe market segment for our Wearable products may not develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate which may impact our ability to grow revenues. We have developed head-worn, voice and gesture controlled, hands-free cloud computing headset concept designs which we intend to license to customers and various components for wearable devices which we intend to sell to customers. We also plan to sell our display and other components either as part of the license arrangement. We refer to our headset concept designs and components as our Wearable products. Our success will depend on the acceptance of wearable products by consumers and in particular the widespread adoption of the headset format. We are unable to predict when or if consumers will adopt wearable products. Customers may determine that the headset is not comfortable, weighs too much, costs too much or provides too little functionality. In addition, the wearable headset products may be accepted by consumers but manufactures may choose to offer our competitors products or products which do not have our components in them. Our success in commercializing our Wearable products is very important in our ability to achieve positive cash flow and profitability. If we are unable to commercialize our wearable computing products we may not be able to increase revenues, achieve profitability or positive cash flow.\nOur revenues and cash flows could be negatively affected if sales of our Display products for military applications significantly decline. The U.S. federal government has incurred and is expected to continue to incur large federal budget deficits and the U.S. federal government has passed legislation to reduce spending on military programs. In addition, in 2013 some of our customers decided to purchase display products from our competitors for programs which we were previously the sole supplier. We expected 2014 revenues and the resulting cash flow from sales to military customers to decline. In the second quarter of 2014, we received unexpected orders for military products which resulted in additional military revenues in the third and fourth quarter of 2014. We expect those revenues to continue in the first quarter of 2015. We received the orders because a competitor was unable to deliver qualified products. We have been informed that the competitor has made improvements to their products and they are being qualified by our customers. Our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from sales to the U.S. military is dependent on our display products being qualified in new U.S. military programs and or remaining qualified in\nexisting US military programs and the U.S. military funding these new and existing programs. Our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from sales to the U.S. military is also dependent on winning contracts in competition against our competitors. If we are unable to be qualified into new U.S. military programs, remain qualified in existing programs, win orders against our competition or military programs are not funded our ability to generate revenues, achieve profitability and positive cash flow will be negatively impacted.\nWe depend on third parties to provide integrated circuit chip sets and critical raw materials for use with our headset concept design and display products and we periodically receive \u201cend of life\u201d notices from suppliers that they will no longer be providing a raw material. We do not manufacture the integrated circuit chip sets which are used to electronically interface between our display products and our customer's products. Instead, we rely on third party independent contractors for these integrated circuit chip sets. We purchase critical raw materials such as special glasses, wafers, adhesives, chemicals, lenses, backlights, printed circuit boards and other components from third party suppliers. Some of these third party contractors and suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources. In addition, relative to the commercial market, the military buys a small number of units which prevents us from qualifying and buying components economically from multiple vendors. We periodically receive notices from suppliers of our critical raw materials that they are will stop selling the raw materials. This requires us to identify another raw material to replace the discontinued one. We then have to internally re-qualify the display with the new material and we may be required to re-qualify the display with our customer. If any of these third party contractors or suppliers were unable or unwilling to supply these integrated circuit chip sets or critical raw materials to us, we would be unable to manufacture and sell our display products until a replacement material could be found. We may not be able to find a replacement material or if we are able to find a replacement material we may be unable to sell our products until they have been qualified both internal and with the customer. The U.S. military is expected to reduce its purchases which may result in lower demand for our products. Lower volume purchases may make it uneconomical for some of our suppliers to provide raw materials we need. We cannot assure investors that a replacement third party contractor or supplier could be found on reasonable terms or in a timely manner. Any interruption in our ability to manufacture and distribute our display products could cause our display business to be unsuccessful and the value of investors' investment in us may decline.\nOur products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Companies in software generation and the display industries steadfastly pursue and protect intellectual property rights. This has resulted in considerable and costly litigation to determine the validity of patents and claims by third parties of infringement of patents or other intellectual property. Our products could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Other companies may hold or obtain patents or inventions or other proprietary rights in technology necessary for our business. Periodically companies inquire about our products and technology in their attempts to assess whether we violate their intellectual property rights. If we are forced to defend against infringement claims, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel, and product shipment delays, even if the allegations of infringement are unwarranted. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us and we are unable to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, or if we are required to cease using one or more of our business or product names due to a successful trademark infringement claim against us, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and rapidly changing and we may be unable to compete successfully. There are a number of companies that develop or may develop products that compete in our targeted markets.\nThe individual components that we offer for sale (displays, optical lenses, backlights and ASICs) are also offered by companies whose sole business is the individual component. For example, there are companies whose sole business is to sell optical lenses. Accordingly, our strategy requires us to develop technologies and to compete in multiple markets. Some of our competitors are much larger than we are and have significantly greater financial, development and marketing resources than we do. The competition in these markets could adversely affect our operating results by reducing the volume of the products we sell or the prices we can charge. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do.\nOur success will depend substantially upon our ability to enhance our products and technologies and to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and incorporate technological enhancements. If we are unable to develop new products and enhance functionalities or technologies to adapt to these changes, or if we are unable to realize synergies among our acquired products and technologies, our business will suffer.\nDisruptions of our production of our Display products would adversely affect our operating results. If we were to experience any significant disruption in the operation of our facilities, we would be unable to supply our display products to our customers. Many of our sales contracts include financial penalties for late delivery. In the past, we experienced several power outages at our facilities which ranged in duration from one to four days. Additionally, as we introduce new equipment into our\nmanufacturing processes, our display products could be subject to especially wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency. We may experience manufacturing problems that would result in delays in product introduction and delivery or yield fluctuations. We are also subject to the risks associated with the shortage of raw materials used in the manufacture of our products.\nOur ability to manufacture and distribute our Display products would be severely limited if the foundries that we rely on to manufacture integrated circuits for our Display products fail to provide those services. We depend principally on a Taiwanese foundry for the fabrication of integrated circuits for our display products. We have no long-term contracts with this foundry and from time to time we have been put on allocation which means the foundry will limit the amount of wafers they will process for us. If the foundry was to terminate its arrangement with us or become unable to provide the required capacity and quality on a timely basis, we may not be able to manufacture and ship our display products or we may be forced to manufacture them in limited quantities until replacement foundry services can be obtained. Furthermore, we cannot assure investors that we would be able to establish alternative manufacturing and packaging relationships on acceptable terms.\nOur reliance on this foundry involves certain risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nLack of control over production capacity and delivery schedules;\n\u2022\nLimited control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs;\n\u2022\nThe risks associated with international commerce, including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, changes in tariffs and trade policies and political and economic instability; and\n\u2022\nNatural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunami, mudslides, drought, hurricanes and tornadoes.\nDue to natural disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons that have occasionally occurred in Taiwan, many Taiwanese companies, including the Taiwanese foundry we use, have experienced related business interruptions. Our business could suffer significantly if either of the foundries we use had operations which were disrupted for an extended period of time due to natural disaster, political unrest or financial instability. In addition, our display products are manufactured on 6-inch and 8-inch silicon wafers. We currently do not anticipate redesigning all of our displays made on 6-inch wafers so they can be manufactured on 8-inch wafers. Our current military products are primarily manufactured on 6-inch wafers. We cannot be assured that if the 6-inch or 8-inch manufacturing facilities we use were damaged, they would be restored, or that our foundry service providers will not discontinue the operation of their 6-inch manufacturing lines. If the 6-inch manufacturing lines were discontinued and the displays had to be redesigned we may need to have the displays re-qualified by our customers, which would adversely affect our business until such qualification is complete.\nOur headset concept system is dependent on software which we have limited experience in developing, marketing or licensing. Our headset concept designs include a combination of commercially available software, such as Microsoft Windows CE and Android, voice activated software technologies, such as Nuance Dragon NaturallySpeaking, and operating and speech enhancement software that we internally developed or acquired. We have little experience in developing, marketing or licensing software. If we are unable to integrate internally developed and or acquired software in our headset concept designs we may not be able to license the designs. The market demand for our headset concept designs or the products our customers may develop based on our concept designs is dependent on our ability to collaborate with software developers who write application software (\u201capps\u201d) in order to create utility in our customer's products. If we are unable to develop, license or acquire software or if we or the market in general does not create a sufficient body of application software our concept designs may not be accepted by the market and we may not be able to increase revenues, achieve profitability or positive cash flow.\nWe license intellectual property rights of others. Included in our headset concept systems is software which we license from other companies. Should we violate the terms of a license our license could be being canceled. The companies may decide to stop supporting the software we license or new versions of the software may not be compatible with our software which would require us to rewrite our software which we may not be able to do. The license fees we pay may be increased which would negatively affect our ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow. If we are unable to obtain and or maintain existing software license relationships our ability to grow revenue and achieve profitability and positive cash flow may be negative affected.\nOur headset concept systems use software that we license from other companies (Licensors) and requires us to access the Licensor's data centers and interruptions or delays in service from data center hosting facilities could impair our customer's products. Any damage to, or failure of, the systems of our Licensors generally could result in interruptions in service to our customers. Interruptions in service to our customers may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their contracts and reduce our ability to attract new customers.\nThe market for cloud-based applications may develop more slowly than we expect. Our success will depend, to some extent, on the willingness of businesses to accept cloud-based services for applications that they view as critical to the success of their business. Many companies have invested substantial effort and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to a different application or to migrate these applications to cloud-based services. Other factors that may affect market acceptance of our application include:\n\u2022\nthe security capabilities, reliability and availability of cloud-based services;\n\u2022\nour ability to implement upgrades and other changes to our software without disrupting our service;\n\u2022\nthe level of customization or configuration we offer; and\n\u2022\nthe price, performance and availability of competing products and services.\nThe market for these services may not develop further, or may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would negatively affect our ability to grow revenues, achieve profitability and generate positive cash flow.\nWe may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights and we may incur substantial costs in defending our intellectual property. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We have obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions when appropriate. We also attempt to protect our proprietary information with contractual arrangements and under trade secret laws. Our employees and consultants generally enter into agreements containing provisions with respect to confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while in our employ. These measures may not adequately protect our intellectual and proprietary rights. Existing trade secret, trademark and copyright laws afford only limited protection and our patents could be invalidated or circumvented. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not fully protect our intellectual property rights. Misappropriation of our technology and the costs of defending our intellectual property rights from misappropriation could substantially impair our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our business may not be successful and the value of investors' investment in us may decline.\nWe have a $15 million receivable due January 16, 2016 which if not paid would affect our cash flow. The Company has a $15 million receivable in connection with the sale of its III-V product line and investment in KTC, which is due January 16, 2016. The buyer has outstanding debt and the repayment of the receivable is subject to the Buyer remaining within its debt compliance obligations at the time of repayment. If the Buyer is unable to pay us the $15 million our cash flow would be negatively impacted.\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of, or fail to attract, key personnel. In order to continue to provide quality products in our rapidly changing business, we believe it is important to retain personnel with experience and expertise relevant to our business. Our success depends in large part upon a number of key management and technical employees. The loss of the services of one or more key employees, including Dr. John C.C. Fan, our President and Chief Executive Officer, could seriously impede our success. We do not maintain any \u201ckey-man\u201d insurance policies on Dr. Fan or any other employees. In addition, due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support our existing and new customers, our success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled management, technical, and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions. If the display markets experience an upturn, we may need to increase our workforce. Due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate, we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining these personnel. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our ability to develop and manufacture our products.\nOur customers who purchase display products for military applications typically incorporate our products into their products which are sold to the U.S. government under contracts. U.S. government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and may be terminated or modified prior to completion, which could adversely affect our business. Congress funds the vast majority of the federal budget on an annual basis, and Congress often does not provide agencies with all the money requested in their budget. Many of our customers' contracts cover multiple years and, as such, are not fully funded at contract award. If Congress or a U.S. government agency chooses to spend money on other programs, our customer contracts may be terminated for convenience. Federal laws, collectively called the Anti-Deficiency Act, prohibit involving the government in any obligation to pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose, unless otherwise allowed by law. Therefore, the Anti-Deficiency Act indirectly regulates how the agency awards our contracts and pays our invoices. Federal government contracts generally contain provisions, and are subject to laws and regulations, that provide the federal government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions permitting the federal government to, among other provisions: terminate our existing contracts; modify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts; subject the award to protest or challenge by competitors; suspend work under existing multiple year contracts and related delivery orders; and claim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us.\nThe federal government may terminate a contract with us or our customer either \u201cfor convenience\u201d (for instance, due to a change in its perceived needs) or if we default due to our failure or the failure of a subcontractor to perform under the contract. If the federal government terminates a contract with our customer our contract with our customers generally would entitle us to recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. However, under certain circumstances, our recovery costs upon termination for convenience of such a contract may be limited. As is common with government contractors, we have experienced occasional performance issues under some of our contracts. We may in the future receive show-cause or cure notices under contracts that, if not addressed to the federal government's satisfaction, could give the government the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts.\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts and subcontracts typically involve long purchase and payment cycles, competitive bidding, qualification requirements, delays or changes in funding, extensive specification and performance requirements, price negotiations and milestone requirements. Each U.S. government agency often also maintains its own rules and regulations with which we must comply and which can vary significantly among agencies.\nMost of our military sales are on a fixed-price basis, which could subject us to losses if there are cost overruns. Under a fixed-price contract, we receive only the amount indicated in the contract, regardless of the actual cost to produce the goods. While firm fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from potential cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. If the initial estimates that we use to calculate the sales price and the cost to perform the work prove to be incorrect, we could incur losses. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, scheduling, and performance. If we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, then our cost to perform the work could increase, which would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Some of the contracts we bid on have \u201cIndefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity\u201d or IDIQ provisions. This means we are bidding a fixed price but are not assured of the quantity the government will buy or when it will buy during the term of the contract. This means we are exposed to the risk of price increases for labor, overhead and raw materials during the term of the contract. We may incur losses on fixed-price and IDIQ contracts that we had expected to be profitable, or such contracts may be less profitable than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers, which makes forecasting our revenues and operating results difficult. We generally do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase our products. Our business is characterized by short-term purchase orders and shipment schedules and we generally permit orders to be canceled or rescheduled before shipment without significant penalty. As a result, our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time, which makes forecasting our revenues difficult. In addition, due to the absence of substantial non-cancelable backlog, we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. Our operating results are difficult to forecast because we are continuing to invest in capital equipment and increasing our operating expenses for new product development. If we fail to accurately forecast our revenues and operating results, our business may not be successful and the value of investors' investment in us may decline.\nIf we fail to keep pace with changing technologies, we may lose customers. Rapidly changing customer requirements, evolving technologies and industry standards characterize the display industries. To achieve our goals, we need to enhance our existing products and develop and market new products that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards, requirements and customer preferences. If we cannot keep pace with these changes, our business could suffer.\nIf our security systems are penetrated and confidential and or proprietary information were taken we could be subject to fines, law suits and loss of customers. We rely on our electronic information systems to perform the routine transactions to run our business. We transact business over the Internet with customers, vendors and our subsidiaries. We have implemented security measures to protect unauthorized access to this information. We have also implemented security policies which limit access via the Internet from the company to the outside world based on the individual's position in the company. We routinely receive security patches for the software we use from the software providers. Our primary concerns are inappropriate access to personnel information, information covered under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation, product designs and manufacturing information, financial information and our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how. If our security systems are penetrated and confidential and or proprietary information were taken we could be subject to fines, law suites and loss of customers.\nWe may have to record additional intangible assets and/or goodwill impairment losses. In fiscal year 2013 we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $1.5 million related to our acquisitions of Intoware and Forth Dimension Displays (FDD). In 2012, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $1.7 million related to our acquisition of FDD. During 2013, we\nrecorded $0.4 million of goodwill related to our acquisition of eMDT, Inc. and, in 2012, we recorded $0.7 million of goodwill and $0.6 million in intangible assets related to Intoware. We may have to record additional goodwill write downs if we are unable to generate positive cash flow from the sale of wearable products which will negatively affect our financial results.\nA disruption to our information technology systems could significantly impact our operations and impact our revenue and profitability. We maintain proprietary data processing systems and use customized software systems. We also use software packages which are no longer supported by their developer. An interruption to these systems for an extended period may impact our ability to operate the businesses and process transactions which could result in a decline in sales and affect our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\nFluctuations in operating results make financial forecasting difficult and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly for numerous reasons, including:\n\u2022\nThe timing and successful introduction of additional manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\nThe timing of the initial selection of our Wearable technology and display products as component in our customers' new products;\n\u2022\nAvailability of interface electronics for our display products;\n\u2022\nCompetitive pressures on selling prices of our products;\n\u2022\nThe timing and cancellation of customer orders;\n\u2022\nOur ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nOur ability to successfully reduce costs;\n\u2022\nThe cancellation of U.S. government contracts; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to secure agreements from our major customers for the purchase of our products.\nWe typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. Our operating results are difficult to forecast because we continue to invest in capital equipment and increase our operating expenses for new product development.\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors should not rely on our revenues and our operating results for any one quarter or year as an indication of our future revenues or operating results. If our quarterly revenues or results of operations fall below expectations of investors or public market analysts, the price of our common stock could fall substantially.\nIf we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our federal government contracts. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur additional costs, and non-compliance may also allow for the assignment of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. Among the more significant laws and regulations affecting our business are the following:\n\u2022\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulation, which comprehensively regulates the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts;\n\u2022\nThe Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;\n\u2022\nThe Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based federal government contracts; and\n\u2022\nLaws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data. We engage in international work falling under the jurisdiction of U.S. export control laws. Failure to comply with these control regimes can lead to severe penalties, both civil and criminal, and can include debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.\nOur contracting agency customers may review our performance under and compliance with the terms of our federal government contracts. If a government review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including\n\u2022\nTermination of contracts;\n\u2022\nForfeiture of profits;\n\u2022\nCost associated with triggering of price reduction clauses;\n\u2022\nSuspension of payments;\n\u2022Fines; and\n\u2022Suspension or debarment from doing business with federal government agencies.\nAdditionally, the False Claims Act provides for potentially substantial civil penalties where, for example, a contractor presents a false or fraudulent claim to the government for payment or approval. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the government or by other persons on behalf of the government (who may then share a portion of any recovery).\nIf we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may also suffer harm to our reputation, which could impair our ability to win awards of contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts. If we are subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions or suffer harm to our reputation, our current business, future prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be materially harmed.\nThe government may also revise its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, including cost accounting standards, at any time. Any new contracting methods could be costly to satisfy, be administratively difficult for us to implement and could impair our ability to obtain new contracts.\nA decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, prolonged U.S. government shutdown or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues, cash flow and financial results. The Budget Control Act of 2011 enacted 10-year discretionary spending caps which are expected to generate over $1 trillion in savings for the U.S. government, a substantial portion of which comes from Department of Defense baseline spending reductions. There remains much uncertainty about the level of cuts that will be required for government fiscal year 2015 and the impact those cuts will have on contractors supporting the government. In light of the current uncertainty, we are not able to predict the potential impact of reduced military expenditures on our Company or our financial results.\nCustomer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may adversely affect us. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These new requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices (including our products). We will incur additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. We purchase materials from foreign sources and they may not cooperate and provide us with the necessary information to allow us to comply with the Act. This may require us to find alternative sources which could delay product shipments. We may also encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free.\nWe may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with stringent environmental laws and regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or if we did not comply with these regulations in the past. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process. We are also subject to federal ITAR laws which regulate the export of technical data and export of products to other nations which may use these products for military purposes. The failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances, or otherwise comply with environmental regulations, could subject us to significant future liabilities. Any failure on our part to obtain any required licenses for the export of technical data and/or export of our products or to otherwise comply with ITAR, could subject us to significant future liabilities. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have not in the past violated applicable laws or regulations, which violations could result in required remediation or other liabilities. We also cannot be certain that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will protect us from required remediation or other liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations.\nWe may be unable to modify our products to meet regulatory or customer requirements. From time to time our display products are subject to new domestic and international requirements such as the European Union's Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive. If we are unable to comply with these regulations we may not be permitted to ship our products, which would adversely affect our revenue and ability to maintain profitability.\nWe may pursue acquisitions and investments that could adversely affect our business. In the past we have made, and in the future we may make, acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, products and technologies that could complement or expand our business. If we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses, products or technologies into our existing business and products. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets. In 2014, 2012 and 2011 we acquired 29% of the outstanding shares of eMDT Inc. for 80% ownership, 58% of the outstanding shares of Intoware Consulting Ltd. and 100% of the outstanding shares of Forth Dimension Displays Ltd. (FDD), respectively. If we are unable to operate eMDT, Intoware and FDD profitably, our results of operations will be\nnegatively affected. We perform periodic reviews to determine if these investments are impaired, but such reviews are difficult and rely on significant judgment about the company\u2019s technology, ability to obtain customers, and ability to become cash flow positive and profitable. We may take future impairment charges which will have an adverse impact of on our results of operations.\nWe plan on adopting the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Internal Control-Integrated Framework as revised in 2013 in 2015 but may not meet its requirements On May 14, 2013, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) released its revisions and updates to the 1992 document Internal Control - Integrated Framework. COSO\u2019s goal in updating the framework was to increase its relevance in the increasingly complex and global business environment so that organizations worldwide can better design, implement, and assess internal control. We plan on adopting the revised framework in our fiscal year 2015 but we may not meet its requirements which may affect our ability to meet the rules and regulations of the Security and Exchange Commission.\nInvestors should not expect to receive dividends from us. We have not paid cash dividends in the past, however, in the future we may determine it is in the best interest of the stockholders to do so. Historically our earnings, if any, have been retained for the development of our businesses.\nOur stock price may be volatile in the future. The trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in results of operations, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, general conditions in the wireless communications, semiconductor and display markets, changes in earnings estimates by analysts or other events or factors. In addition, the public stock markets recently have experienced extreme price and trading volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 77515, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "KOPN"}
