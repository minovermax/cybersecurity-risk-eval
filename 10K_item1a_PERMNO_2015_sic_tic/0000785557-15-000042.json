RISK FACTORS\nAs provided for under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"1995 Reform Act\"), we wish to caution shareholders and investors that the following important factors, among others discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, have affected, and in some cases could affect, our actual results of operations and cause our results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements made herein. Our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected due to any of the following risks. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe depend on contracts with the Federal government for virtually all of our revenue and our business could be seriously harmed if the Federal government decreased or ceased doing business with us or changed its budgets or budgetary priorities.\nPresently, the Company derives all of its revenue from agencies of the federal government. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, the Company derived approximately 95% and 96%, respectively, of its revenue from various contracts awarded by the DVA. Accordingly, DLH remains dependent upon the continuation of its relationship with the DVA. As of September 30, 2015, contract awards from the DVA on our Federal supply schedule contract for professional and allied healthcare services is in effect through June 2017. Our logistics worldwide services contract is in effect through November 2017. Both Federal contract schedules are renewed on a recurring basis for a multi-year period. These agreements are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and there can be no assurance as to the actual amount of services that the Company will ultimately provide to the DVA under these awards. Moreover, these contracts are coming up for re-compete, and there is no guarantee that DLH will be the successful bidder. The Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition would be materially adversely affected in the event that we were unable to continue our relationships with the DVA.\nBecause we derive all of our revenue from contracts with the Federal government, the success and development of our business will continue to depend on our successful participation in Federal government contract programs. In recent years past, we have\nseen frequent debates regarding the scope of funding of our customers, thereby leading to budgetary uncertainty for our Federal customers. Future instances of this uncertainty may result in reduced awards, postponements in procurement of services and delays in collection of payments, which may affect our results of operations. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance. In the event the budgets or budgetary priorities of the U.S. Government entities with which we do business, particularly the DVA, are delayed, decreased or underfunded, our consolidated revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nLoss of our GSA schedule contracts or other contracting vehicles could impair our ability to win new business and perform under existing contracts.\nWe currently hold multiple GSA schedule contracts, including a Federal supply schedule contract for professional and allied healthcare services and the logistics worldwide services contract. If we were to lose one or more of these contracts or other contracting vehicles, we could lose a significant revenue source and our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our revenues and operating results from period to period.\nOur profitable financial results depend upon increasing our revenue while managing costs and expense. Our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly and unpredictably in the future. We have expended, and will continue to expend, substantial resources to enhance our health services offerings and expansion into the Federal health market. We may incur growth expenses before new business revenue is realized, thus showing lower profitability in a particular period or consecutive periods. We may be unable to achieve desired levels of revenue growth due to circumstances that are beyond our control, as already expressed regarding competition, government budgets, and the procurement process in general. Although we continue to manage our operating costs and expenses, there is no guarantee that we will significantly increase future revenue and profit in any particular future period. Revenue levels achieved from our customers, the mix of solutions that we offer and our performance on future contracts will affect our financial results.\nFuture legislative or government budgetary and spending changes could negatively impact our business.\nU.S. Government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. For many programs, Congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years. Consequently, programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations.\nDVA programs, which accounted for approximately 95% of our revenue during the past two years, were exempt from the spending caps established under Federal government sequestration targets enacted in 2013. However, our growth into other government markets may be impacted by measures in place since March 2013, when the federal government began operating under sequestration required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA). Under sequestration, reductions in both defense and civil agency expenditures have taken place in each of the government\u2019s fiscal years since 2013 and, unless the BCA is amended or repealed, will continue through the government\u2019s Fiscal Year 2021.\nOn October 1, 2015, the U.S. Government began operating under a continuing resolution (CR) as a result of there being no annual appropriations bills signed into law prior to the start of the government\u2019s Fiscal Year 2016 on that date. The CR funds the government through December 11, 2015. At the end of October 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA) was passed and signed into law. The legislation raises the discretionary spending caps under the BCA by $50 billion and $30 billion in the government\u2019s Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017, respectively. Appropriation of the Fiscal 2016 federal budget, however, is pending approval by the U.S. Congress and the continuing resolution remains in effect. If appropriation funding is not passed by December 11, 2015, another short-term continuing resolution will be needed or the federal government could shut down, which could delay contract awards as well as adversely impact our future revenues and growth prospects.\nSignificant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and U.S. Government funding more broadly may negatively impact our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe U.S. Government contract bid process is highly competitive, complex and sometimes lengthy, and is subject to protest and implementation delays.\nMany of our contracts and task orders with the Federal government are awarded through a competitive bidding process, which is complex and sometimes lengthy. We expect that much of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will continue to be awarded through competitive bidding. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do,\nlarger client bases and greater brand recognition. Our competitors, individually or through relationships with third parties, may be able to provide clients with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide. If we are unsuccessful in competing with these other companies, our revenues and margins may materially decline.\nThis competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following: (i) we expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win, and to defend those bids through any protest process; (ii) we may be unable to estimate accurately the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and (iii) we may encounter expenses and delays if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract, and the termination or non-renewal of any of our significant contracts could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nIf a bid is won and a contract awarded, there still is the possibility of a bid protest or other delays in implementation. Our business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work. It can take many months to resolve protests by one or more of our competitors of contract awards we receive. The resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated, and there can be no assurance that such protest process or implementation delays will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the future.\nOur business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances or other qualifications we and they need to perform services for our clients.\nMany federal government contracts require us to have security clearances and employ personnel with specified levels of education, work experience and security clearances. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees lose or are unable to obtain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them. To the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for our employees working on a particular contract, we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract, which could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nOur business is regulated by complex federal procurement laws and regulations, and we are subject to periodic compliance reviews by governmental agencies.\nWe must comply with complex laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of federal government contracts. These laws and regulations create compliance risk and affect how we do business with our federal agency clients, and may impose added costs on our business. The government may in the future reform its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, including cost accounting standards, that could be costly to satisfy or that could impair our ability to obtain new contracts.\nOur performance on our U.S. Government contracts and our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including submission of invoices to our customers, are subject to audit by the government. The scope of any such audits could span multiple fiscal years. If a government review or investigation uncovers illegal activities or activities not in compliance with a particular contract's terms or conditions, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, harm to our reputation, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with Federal government agencies. Any of these events could lead to a material reduction in our revenues, cash flows and operating results. Further, as the reputation and relationships that we have established and currently maintain with government personnel and agencies are important to our ability to maintain existing business and secure new business, damage to our reputation or relationships could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nU.S. Government contracts may be terminated at will and we may not receive the full amounts authorized under the contracts included in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated.\nMany of the U.S. Government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor may extend for several years. The U.S. Government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts for convenience and to the extent that a contract award contemplates one or more option years, the Government may decline to exercise such option periods. Accordingly, the maximum contract value specified under a government contract or task order awarded to us is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that we will realize under that contract. Due to our dependence on these programs, the modification,\ncurtailment or termination of our major programs or contracts may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our contracts may only be partially funded at any point during their term, and some of the work intended to be performed under such contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequent appropriations of funds to the contract by the procuring agency. Our backlog consists of funded backlog, which is based on amounts actually committed by a client for payment for goods and services, and unfunded backlog, which is based upon management's estimate of the future potential of our existing contracts and task orders, including options, to generate revenue. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nOur business growth and profitable operations require that we develop and maintain strong relationships with other contractors with whom we partner or otherwise depend.\nAs we look to increase revenue from teaming ventures with other companies, we carry substantial risk in maintaining strong, trusted working relationships in order to successfully fulfill contract obligations. Teaming arrangements may include being engaged as a subcontractor to a prime contractor, engaging a subcontractor on a contract for which we are the prime contractor, or entering into a joint venture with another company. We may lack control over fulfillment of such contracts, and poor performance on the contract could impact our customer relationship, even if we perform as required. We expect to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Our revenue and operating results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any such prime contractor or teammate choses to offer directly to the client services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.\nOur employees, or those of our teaming partners, may engage in misconduct or other improper activities which could harm our business.\nWe are exposed to risk from misconduct or fraud by our employees, or employees of our teaming partners. Such violations could include intentional disregard for Federal government procurement regulations, engaging in unauthorized activities, seeking reimbursement for improper expenses, or falsifying time records. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of our clients' sensitive or classified information and result in a serious harm to our reputation. While we have appropriate policies in effect to deter illegal activities and promote proper conduct, it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct. Precautions to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling such risks or losses, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and liquidity.\nOur profits and revenues could suffer if we are involved in legal proceedings, investigations and disputes.\nWe are exposed to legal proceedings, investigations and disputes. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business we may become involved in legal disputes regarding personal injury or employee disputes. While we provision for these types of incidents through commercial third party insurance carriers, we often defray these types of cost through higher deductibles. Any unfavorable legal ruling against us could result in substantial monetary damages by losing our deductible portion of carried insurance. We maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to lower our potential liabilities. If we sustain liabilities that exceed our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including our profits, revenues and liquidity.\nWe are dependent upon certain of our management personnel and do not maintain \"key personnel\" life insurance on our executive officers.\nOur success to date has resulted in part from the significant contributions of our executive officers. Our executive officers are expected to continue to make important contributions to our success. As of September 30, 2015, our CEO, CFO, Executive Vice President, and the President of DLH Solutions are under employment contracts. However, we do not maintain \"key person\" life insurance on any of our executive officers. Loss for any reason of the services of our key personnel could materially affect our operations.\nWe may not be fully covered by the insurance we procure and our business could be adversely impacted if we were not able to renew all of our insurance plans.\nAlthough we carry multiple lines of liability insurance (including coverage for medical malpractice and workers' compensation), they may not be sufficient to cover the total cost of any judgments, settlements or costs relating to any present or future claims, suits or complaints. If we are unable to secure renewal of our insurance contracts or the renewal of such contracts with favorable rates and with competitive benefits, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, sufficient insurance may not be available to us in the future on satisfactory terms or at all. Our placement of employees increases our potential liability for negligence and professional malpractice and such liabilities may not become immediately apparent. Any increase in our costs of insurance will impact our profitability to the extent that we cannot offset these increases into our costs of services. If the insurance we carry is not sufficient to cover any judgments, settlements or costs relating to any present or\nfuture claims, suits or complaints, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nOur financial condition may be affected by increases in employee healthcare claims and insurance premiums, unemployment taxes and workers' compensation claims and insurance rates.\nOur current workers' compensation and medical plans are partially self-funded insurance programs. The Company currently pays base premiums plus actual losses incurred, not to exceed certain individual and aggregate stop-loss limits. In addition, health insurance premiums, state unemployment taxes and workers' compensation rates for the Company are in large part determined by our claims experience. These categories of expenditure comprise a significant portion of our direct costs. If we experience a large increase in claim activity, our direct expenditures, health insurance premiums, unemployment taxes or workers' compensation rates may increase. Although we employ internal and external risk management procedures in an attempt to manage our claims incidence and estimate claims expenses and structure our benefit contracts to provide as much cost stability as reasonably possible given the self-funded nature of our plans, we may not be able to prevent increases in claim activity, accurately estimate our claims expenses or pass the cost of such increases on to our clients. Since our ability to incorporate such increases into our fees to our clients is constrained by contractual arrangements with our clients, a delay could occur before such increases could be reflected in our fees, which may reduce our profit margin. As a result, such increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf we are unable to attract qualified personnel, our business may be negatively affected.\nWe rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified professionals and other personnel who possess the skills, experience and licenses necessary in order to provide our solutions for our assignments. Our business is materially dependent upon the continued availability of such qualified personnel. Our inability to secure qualified personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business. The cost of attracting qualified personnel and providing them with attractive benefits packages may be higher than we anticipate and, as a result, if we are unable to pass these costs on to our clients, our profitability could decline. Moreover, if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, the quality of our services may decline and, as a result, we could lose clients.\nWe are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards.\nSince the effectiveness for us of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we spend an increasing amount of management's time and resources (both internal and external) to comply with changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosures. This compliance requires management's annual review and evaluation of our internal control systems. This process has caused us to engage outside advisory services and has resulted in additional accounting and legal expenses. We may encounter problems or delays in completing these reviews and evaluation and the implementation of improvements. If we are not able to timely comply with the requirements set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action could materially adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nWe are highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information systems.\nWe are highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information systems in operating our business. Critical information systems used in daily operations match employee resources and client assignments and track regulatory credentialing. They also perform payroll, billing and accounts receivable functions. While we have multiple back up plans for these types of contingencies, our information systems are vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, telecommunication outages, physical or software break-ins and similar events. If our information systems become inoperable, or are otherwise unavailable, these functions would have to be accomplished manually, which in turn could impact our financial viability, due to the increased cost associated with performing these functions manually.\nWe may have difficulty identifying and executing acquisitions on favorable terms and therefore may grow at slower than anticipated rates.\nOne of our key growth strategies is to selectively pursue acquisitions. Through acquisitions, we expect to be able to expand our base of federal government customers, increase the range of solutions we offer to our customers and deepen our penetration of existing markets and customers. We may encounter difficulty identifying and executing suitable acquisitions. To the extent that management is involved in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating new acquisitions into our business, our management may be diverted from operating our core business. Without acquisitions, we may not grow as rapidly as expected, which could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nWe may encounter other risks in executing our acquisition strategy, including:\n\u2022\nincreased competition for acquisitions may increase the costs of our acquisitions;\n\u2022\nnon-discovery or non-disclosure of material liabilities during the due diligence process, including omissions by prior owners of any acquired businesses or their employees in complying with applicable laws or regulations, or their inability to fulfill their contractual obligations to the federal government or other customers; and\n\u2022\nacquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny of these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nWe may have difficulty integrating the operations of any companies we acquire, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nThe success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon our ability to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire in the future. The integration of these businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, absorb significant management attention and require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. These integration difficulties include the integration of personnel with disparate business backgrounds, the transition to new information systems, coordination of geographically dispersed organizations, loss of key employees of acquired companies, and reconciliation of different corporate cultures. For these or other reasons, we may be unable to retain key customers of acquired companies. Moreover, any acquired business may not generate the revenue or net income we expected or produce the efficiencies or cost-savings we anticipated. Any of these outcomes could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nIf our subcontractors do not perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nOur performance of government contracts may involve the issuance of subcontracts to other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. Unsatisfactory performance by one or more of our subcontractors to deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services, or appropriately manage their vendors may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor. A subcontractor\u2019s performance deficiency could result in the government terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the government and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders. Depending upon the level of problem experienced, such problems with subcontractors could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet. Future write-offs of goodwill may have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses.\nWe have previously obtained growth through acquisitions of other companies and businesses. Under existing accounting standards, we are required to periodically review goodwill assets for possible impairment. In the event that we are required to write down the value of any assets under these pronouncements, it may materially and adversely affect our earnings. See the more detailed discussion appearing as part of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 herein.\nWe have a significant amount of net operating loss carry forwards which we may not be able to utilize in certain circumstances.\nAt September 30, 2015, we had net operating losses, or NOLs, of approximately $36.8 million and $2.4 million for U.S. and state tax return purposes, respectively. Our U.S. NOLs begin to expire in 2021 and continue to expire through 2033. The tax effect of these net operating losses are offset by valuation allowances of $1.8 million as of September 30, 2015. Due to our recent trend of positive operating results, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 we realized a $5.5 million tax benefit related to the release of a portion of our valuation allowance, to reflect the amount of our deferred tax asset that we expect to realize in future years. This release is based upon our current estimate of future taxable earnings based on results generated through the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. As a result of our non-cash valuation allowance release during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, our U.S. tax provision expense in future periods may be at a higher effective tax rate, which will reduce our net income (or loss) and earnings (or loss) per share by a greater amount than it has in the past.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our secured loan facility.\nDetails of the revolving credit line are disclosed in Part II - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis and in Note 5 to the consolidated audited financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Loan Agreement requires compliance with customary covenants and contains restrictions on the Company's ability to engage in certain transactions. Further, the Loan Agreement provides for customary events of default following which the Lender may, at its option, immediately terminate the loan agreement and accelerate the repayment of any amount outstanding. The defined events of default include, among other things, a material adverse change in the Company's circumstances, or if the Lender deems itself insecure in the ability of the Company to repay its obligations, or as to the sufficiency of the collateral. In the event that any of the covenants included in the Loan Agreement were not complied with, the Lender could declare a default under the Loan Agreement, which, if not waived, could cause any amounts then outstanding to become immediately due and payable.\nRisks Relating To Our Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile and your investment in our common stock may suffer a decline in value.\nThe price of our common stock could be subject to fluctuations and may decline in the future due to risks defined herein, or general changes in market conditions such as increased interest rates, a recession, or a change in Federal spending priorities.\nSince we have not paid dividends on our common stock, you cannot expect dividend income from an investment in our common stock.\nWe have not paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not contemplate or anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Current lenders do and future potential lenders may prohibit us from paying dividends without its prior consent. Therefore, holders of our common stock may not receive any dividends on their investment in us. Earnings, if any, may be retained and used to finance the development and expansion of our business.\nWe may issue preferred stock with rights senior to our common stock, which may adversely impact the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, which would adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. In the event of issuance, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company, which could have the effect of discouraging bids for our Company and thereby prevent stockholders from receiving the maximum value for their shares. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of our preferred stock, in order to discourage or delay a change of control of our Company, we may do so in the future. In addition, we may determine to issue preferred stock in connection with capital raising efforts and the terms of the stock so issued could have special voting rights or rights related to the composition of our Board.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Articles of Incorporation make a change in control of our Company more difficult.\nThe provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, together or separately, could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control and limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nrequire certain supermajority votes; and\n\u2022\nestablish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholders' proposals to be considered at shareholders' meetings.\nIn addition, the New Jersey Business Corporation Act contains provisions that, under certain conditions, prohibit business combinations with 10% shareholders and any New Jersey corporation for a period of five years from the time of acquisition of shares by the 10% shareholder. The New Jersey Business Corporation Act also contains provisions that restrict certain business combinations and other transactions between a New Jersey corporation and 10% shareholders.\nOur executive officers, directors and significant stockholders will be able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval\nAs of September 30, 2015, our executive officers, directors and largest shareholder (Wynnefield Capital, Inc. and its affiliates) own approximately 55% of our outstanding common stock. Within this amount, Wynnefield Capital, Inc. and its affiliates own\napproximately 46% of our outstanding common stock. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale or merger of our company and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. These transactions might include proxy contests, tender offers, mergers or other purchases of common stock that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, persons associated with Wynnefield Capital, Inc. currently serve on our Board of Directors. As a result of this share ownership and relationships on our Board of Directors, our largest stockholder will be able to influence all affairs and actions of our company, including matters requiring stockholder approval such as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of our principal stockholders may differ from the interests of the other stockholders.", "PERMNO": 10257, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "DLHC"}
