{"cik": "855658", "company": "LATTICE SEMICONDUCTOR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-04", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered before making an investment decision relating to our common stock. If any of the risks described below occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial results.\nWe rely on independent foundries for the manufacture of all of our products and a manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity could adversely affect our operations.\nWe depend on independent foundries to supply silicon wafers for many of our products. These foundries include Fujitsu in Japan, which supplies the majority of our wafers. We negotiate wafer volumes, prices and other terms with our foundry partners and their respective affiliates on a periodic basis typically resulting in short-term agreements which do not ensure long-term supply or allocation commitments. We rely on our foundry partners to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes. Should the foundries that supply our wafers experience manufacturing problems, including unacceptable yields, delays in the realization of the requisite process technologies, or difficulties due to limitations of new and existing process technologies, our operating results could be adversely affected. Should the foundries not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or continue to manufacture a product for the full life of the product, we may be required to prematurely limit or discontinue the sales of certain products or incur significant costs to transfer products to other foundries, and our customer relationships and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, weak economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of the foundries and cause them to limit or discontinue their business operations, resulting in shortages of supply and an inability to meet their commitments to us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nA disruption of our foundry partners' operations as a result of a fire, earthquake, act of terrorism, political or labor unrest, governmental uncertainty, war, disease or other natural disaster or catastrophic event, or any other reason, could disrupt our wafer supply and could adversely affect our operating results.\nEstablishing, maintaining and managing multiple foundry relationships requires the investment of management resources as well as additional costs. If we fail to maintain our foundry relationships, or elect or are required to change foundries, we will incur significant costs and manufacturing delays. The success of certain of our next generation products is dependent upon our ability to successfully partner with Fujitsu and other foundry partners, including Seiko Epson Corporation in Japan, United Microelectronics Corporation in Taiwan, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (\"TSMC\") in Taiwan. If for any reason our foundry partners do not provide their facilities and support for our development efforts, we may be unable to effectively develop new products in a timely manner.\nShould a change in foundry relationships be required, we may be unsuccessful in establishing new foundry relationships for our current or next generation products, or may incur substantial cost and or manufacturing delays until we form and ramp relationships and migrate products, each of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nA downturn in the Communications end market could cause a reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results.\nRevenue from the Communications end market accounted for 42% of our revenue in 2014. Three of our top five customers participate primarily in the Communications end market. In the past, cyclical weakening in demand for programmable logic products from customers in the Communications end market has adversely affected our revenue and operating results. In addition, telecommunication equipment providers are building network infrastructure for which we compete for product sales. Any deterioration in the Communications end market or our end customers' reduction in spending to support this end market could lead to a reduction in demand for our products which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nThe Consumer end market is rapidly changing and cyclical, and our failure to accurately predict the frequency, duration, timing and severity of these cycles could adversely affect our financial condition and results.\nRevenue from the Consumer end market accounted for 25% of our revenue in fiscal 2014. Revenue from the Consumer end market consists primarily of revenue from our products designed and used in a broad range of products including smart handheld devices, flat panel displays, digital cameras and camcorders, gaming consoles, and set-top boxes. This market is characterized by rapidly changing requirements and product features. Our success in this market will depend principally on our ability to:\n\u2022\nmeet the market windows for consumer products;\n\u2022\npredict technology and market trends;\n\u2022\ndevelop IP cores to meet emerging market needs;\n\u2022\ndevelop products on a timely basis; and\n\u2022\navoid cancellations or delay of products.\nOur inability to accomplish any of the foregoing, or to offset the volatility of this end market through diversification into other markets, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Cyclicality in the Consumer market could periodically result in higher or lower levels of revenue and revenue concentration with a single or small number of customers. In addition, rapid changes in this market may affect demand for our products, may cause our revenue derived from sales in this market to vary significantly over time, adversely affecting our financial results.\nWe are dependent on a concentrated group of customers for a significant part of our revenues. If we were to lose any of these customers, our revenue could decrease significantly.\nA large portion of our revenue depends on sales to a limited number of customers. During fiscal 2014, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. accounted for 19% of our total revenue and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd accounted for 12% of our total revenue. Additionally our top five end customers accounted for approximately 45% of our total revenue. If any of these relationships were to diminish, or if these customers were to develop their own solutions, or adopt an alternative solution or a competitor's solution, our results could be adversely affected.\nWhile we strive to maintain a strong relationship with our customers, their continued use of our products is frequently reevaluated, as certain of our customers' product life cycles are relatively short and they continually develop new products. The selection process for our products to be included in our customers' new products is highly competitive. There are no guarantees that our products will be included in the next generation of products introduced by these customers. Any significant loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by, one or more of these customers, or their failure to meet their commitments to us, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If any one or more of our concentrated group of customers were to experience significantly adverse financial conditions, our financial condition and business could be adversely affected as well.\nOur proposed acquisition of Silicon Image may not be completed or may occur on terms different than those contemplated, which could negatively affect our ongoing business.\nOn January 26, 2015, we entered into an agreement to commence a tender offer to acquire Silicon Image, Inc. (\"Silicon Image\"), a leading provider of wired and wireless connectivity solutions, for $7.30 in cash per share, resulting in a purchase price of approximately $602.05 million, plus related fees and expenses. The transaction will be funded through a combination of cash on hand and $350.0 million of new debt financing.\nAcquiring debt may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on the note, and may limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow in the future to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of this debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us. Overall, our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nAdditionally, this debt financing may contain customary covenants, including the requirement to meet specified financial ratios. Events beyond our control may affect our ability to meet those covenants, and failure to comply with covenants under this borrowing arrangement may result in declaration of an event of default. An event of default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of required payments against such indebtedness. We cannot be certain we would be able to remedy any such defaults. If our required payments are accelerated, we cannot be certain that we would have sufficient funds available to pay the indebtedness or that we would have the ability to raise sufficient capital to replace the indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. In addition, in the case of an event of default on this debt financing, the lenders may be permitted to foreclose on our assets securing that indebtedness.\nAlthough we and Silicon Image, Inc. have signed a merger agreement in furtherance of our proposed acquisition of Silicon Image, Inc., the completion of the acquisition is subject to a successful tender offer, regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, and there is no assurance that all of the conditions to closing will be met or that the proposed acquisition will be\ncompleted on a timely basis or at all. In addition, in specified circumstances, we or Silicon Image, Inc. may be permitted to terminate the merger agreement.\nIt is possible that Silicon Image may receive a superior offer from a third party, in which under the terms of the proposed transaction, we have the option to change the terms of our offer to acquire Silicon Image. If the transaction is not completed or is completed on terms different than those contemplated for any reason, we may be harmed in a number of ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nto the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an increase resulting from a market assumption that the transaction will be completed, the market price of our common stock may decline by the value attributed to this assumption, or could decline even more;\n\u2022\nan adverse reaction from our investors and potential investors may reduce future opportunities for financings or business combinations;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay certain costs and expenses relating to the proposed acquisition, whether or not the proposed acquisition is completed, such as significant fees and expenses relating to legal, accounting and advisory services; and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the proposed acquisition may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that, had they been pursued, might have been beneficial to us.\nIf the proposed acquisition is not completed, these risks may materially and adversely affect our stock price, financial results and ongoing business.\nAcquisitions and strategic investments present risks, and we may not realize the goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.\nWe may make further acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. Acquisitions and strategic investments including the proposed acquisition of Silicon Image present risks, including:\n\u2022\nour ongoing business may be disrupted and our management's attention may be diverted by investment, acquisition, transition or integration activities;\n\u2022\nan acquisition or strategic investment may not perform as well or further our business strategy as we expected, and we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected;\n\u2022\nour operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by unexpected costs, claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition;\n\u2022\nwe may discover adverse conditions post-acquisition that are not covered by representations and warranties;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines;\n\u2022\nwe may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products, in general and administrative functions that support such products;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty integrating and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nour liquidity and/or capital structure may be adversely impacted;\n\u2022\nour strategic investments may not perform as expected;\n\u2022\nwe may experience unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions and strategic investments pursuant to United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"); and\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty integrating acquired entities into our global tax structure with potentially negative impacts on our effective tax rate.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions or strategic investments.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from any of our past or future acquisitions. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations, if at all. A sustained decline in the price of our common stock may make it more difficult and expensive to initiate or consummate additional acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms.\nAs a result of past acquisitions, as of January 3, 2015, we had $44.8 million in goodwill on our balance sheet. We are required under U.S. GAAP to test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time that circumstances arise indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. We completed our annual test of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of 2014 and concluded that we did not have any impairment at that time. There is no assurance that future impairment tests will indicate that goodwill will be deemed recoverable.\nWe will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the proposed merger with Silicon Image, Inc.\nWe expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the proposed merger with Silicon Image, Inc. and combining the operations of the two companies. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will be comprised of transaction and regulatory costs related to the merger.\nWe also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the proposed merger and the integration of the two companies' businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, these projected benefits may not be achieved.\nWe depend on distributors to generate a significant portion of our revenue and complete order fulfillment.\nWe depend on our distributors to sell our products to end customers, complete order fulfillment and maintain sufficient inventory of our products. Our distributors also provide technical support and other value-added services to our end customers. Resale of product through distributors accounted for 45% of our revenue in 2014, with two distributors accounting for 34% of our revenue in 2014. We expect our distributors to generate a significant portion of our revenue in the future. Any adverse change to our relationships with our distributors or a failure by one or more of our distributors to perform its obligations to us could have a material impact on our business. In addition, a significant reduction of effort by a distributor to sell our products or a material change in our relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nThe financial health of our distributors is important to our success. Economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health of one or more of our distributors. This could result in the inability of distributors to finance the purchase of our products or cause the distributors to delay payment of their obligation to us and increase our credit risk. If the financial health of our distributors impairs their performance and we are unable to secure alternate distributors, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, our distribution channels have historically experienced consolidation due to merger and acquisition activity. Consolidation may result in our distributors allocating fewer resources to the distribution and sale of our products, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe depend on the timeliness and accuracy of resale reports from our distributors; late or inaccurate resale reports could have a detrimental effect on our ability to properly recognize revenue and our ability to predict future sales.\nOur success and future revenue depends on our ability to innovate, develop and introduce new products which achieve customer and market acceptance, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe programmable logic market is characterized by rapid technology and product evolution, generally followed by a relatively longer ramp process to volume production on advanced technologies. Our competitive position and success depends on our ability to innovate, develop and introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power consumption, form factor and performance addressing the evolving needs of the markets we serve. These new products typically are more technologically complex than their predecessors.\nThe success of new product introductions depends upon numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\ntimely completion and introduction of new product designs;\n\u2022\nability to generate new design opportunities and design wins;\n\u2022\nachieving design wins which result in sales of significant volume;\n\u2022\navailability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new products;\n\u2022\nability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies;\n\u2022\nachieving acceptable yields;\n\u2022\nability to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors;\n\u2022\nability to obtain advanced packaging;\n\u2022\navailability of supporting software design tools;\n\u2022\nutilization of predefined IP logic;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of advanced features in our new products; and\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our customers' products.\nOur product innovation and development efforts may not be successful, our new products may not achieve industry acceptance and we may not achieve the necessary volume of production to achieve acceptable cost. Revenue relating to our mature products is expected to decline in the future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result, we may be increasingly d\nependent on revenue derived from our newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions in the manufacture of our current products. We rely on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining acceptable margins. To the extent such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or that our products do not achieve market acceptance or market acceptance at acceptable pricing, our forecasts of future revenue, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral economic conditions and deterioration in the global business environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAdverse economic conditions may negatively affect customer demand for our products and services and result in delayed or decreased spending amid concerns over declining asset values, inflation, volatility in energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses and sovereign nations, among other concerns. Weak global economic conditions in the past have resulted in weak demand for our products in certain geographies and had an adverse impact on our results of operations. If weak economic conditions persist or worsen, our business could be harmed due to customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders. The inability of customers to obtain credit, the insolvency of one or more customers, or the insolvency of key suppliers could result in production delays. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables, require additional restructuring actions, and decrease our revenue and profitability. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nA number of factors, including our inventory strategy, can impact our gross margins.\nA number of factors, including yield, wafer pricing, cost of packaging raw materials, product mix, market acceptance of our new products, competitive pricing dynamics, geographic and/or end market mix and pricing strategies, can cause our gross margins to fluctuate. In addition, forecasting our gross margins is difficult because a significant portion of our business is based on turns within the same quarter.\nFrom time to time our inventory levels may be higher than historical norms due to inventory build decisions aimed at reducing direct material cost or enabling responsiveness to expected demand. In the event the expected demand does not materialize, we may be subject to incremental excess and obsolescence costs. In addition, future product cost reductions could impact our inventory valuation, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIncreased costs of wafers and materials, or shortages in wafers and materials could adversely impact our gross margins and lead to reduced revenues.\nIf greater demand for wafers is not accommodated by increased foundry capacity, if market demand for wafers or production and assembly materials increases, or if a supplier of our wafers or assembly materials ceases or suspends operations or otherwise experiences a disruption to its operations, our supply of wafers and other materials could become constrained. Worldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is relatively inelastic. Wafer shortages could result in wafer price increases or shortages in materials at production and test facilities, which could adversely impact our ability to meet customer product demands in a timely manner.\nIf any of our current or future foundry partners or assembly and test subcontractors significantly increases the costs of wafers or other materials, interrupts or reduces our supply, including for reasons outside of their control, or if any of our relationships with our partner suppliers is terminated, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on independent contractors for a majority of our assembly, test, and logistics services, and disruption of these services could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on subcontractors to assemble, test and ship our products with acceptable quality and yield levels. Should our subcontractors experience problems impacting the delivery of product to our customers including: prolonged inability to obtain wafers or packaging materials with competitive performance and cost attributes, inability to achieve adequate yields or timely delivery; disruption or defects in assembly, test or shipping services; or delays in stabilizing manufacturing processes or ramping up volume for new products, our operations and operating results may be adversely affected. Economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of our subcontractors and result in their inability to meet their commitments to us resulting in product shortages, quality assurance problems, reduced revenue and/or increased costs which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the past, we have experienced delays in obtaining assembled and tested products and in securing assembly and test capacity commitments from our suppliers. We currently anticipate that our assembly and test capacity commitments are adequate; however, these existing commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods. We negotiate assembly and test prices and capacity commitments from our contractors on a periodic basis. If any of our assembly or test contractors reduce their capacity commitment or increase their prices, and we cannot find alternative sources, our\noperating results could be adversely affected.\nThe semiconductor industry routinely experiences cyclical market patterns and a significant industry downturn could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur revenue and gross margin can fluctuate significantly due to downturns in the semiconductor industry. These downturns can be severe and prolonged and can result in price erosion and weak demand for our products. Weak demand for our products resulting from general economic conditions affecting the end markets we serve or the semiconductor industry specifically and reduced spending by our customers can result, and in the past has resulted, in excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory write-downs. The dynamics of the markets in which we operate make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult. Due to these and other factors, our past results are not reliable predictors of our future results.\nOur expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations of future sales. Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to facilities, capital equipment, and other overhead, are relatively fixed. We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales. Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could adversely affect our operating results.\nForeign sales, accounting for the majority of our revenue, are subject to various risks associated with selling in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from sales outside of the United States. Accordingly, if we experience a decline in foreign sales, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our foreign sales are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in local economic conditions;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate volatility;\n\u2022\ngovernmental stimulus packages, controls and trade restrictions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental policies that promote development and consumption of domestic integrated circuits;\n\u2022\nexport license requirements, foreign trade compliance matters, and restrictions on the use of technology;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, war, terrorism or pandemic disease;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax rates, tariffs or freight rates;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nlonger receivable collection periods;\n\u2022\nnatural or man-made disasters in the countries where we sell our products;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in transportation;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in the global communication infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nlabor regulations.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nWe have significant international operations exposing us to various economic, regulatory, political, and business risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have significant international operations, including foreign sales offices to support our international customers and distributors, an operational center in the Philippines, and research and development sites in China, India and the Philippines. Our international operations have grown as we relocated certain operational, design, and administrative functions outside the United States. In addition, we purchase our wafers from foreign foundries, have our commercial products assembled, packaged and tested by subcontractors located outside the United States, and rely upon an international service provider for inventory management, order fulfillment, and direct sales logistics.\nThese and other integral business activities outside of the United States are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments including trade barriers, economic sanctions, environmental regulations, import and export regulations, duties and tariffs and other trade restrictions, changes in trade policies, anti-corruption laws, domestic and foreign governmental regulations, potential vulnerability of and reduced protection for IP, longer receivable collection periods, disruptions or delays in production or shipments, and instability or fluctuations in currency exchange rates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMoreover, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political instability, terrorist activity, U.S. or other military actions, or economic crises in countries where our main wafer suppliers, end customers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers are located.\nOur global organizational structure and operations expose us to unanticipated tax consequences.\nOur legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In 2011 and 2012, we implemented a global tax structure to more effectively align our corporate structure with our business operations including responsibility for sales and purchasing activities. We created new and realigned existing legal entities, completed intercompany sales of rights to intellectual property, inventory and fixed assets across different tax jurisdictions, and implemented cost-sharing and intellectual property licensing and royalty agreements between our legal entities. We currently operate legal entities in countries where we conduct supply-chain management, design, and sales operations around the world. In some countries, we maintain multiple entities for tax or other purposes. Changes in tax laws, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of the Company and its subsidiaries, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, Singapore and other countries. Future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws. We compute our effective tax rate using actual jurisdictional profits and losses. Changes in the jurisdictional mix of profits and losses may cause fluctuations in the effective tax rate. Adverse changes in tax rates, our tax assets, and tax liabilities could negatively affect our results in the future.\nWe cannot give any assurance as to what taxes we pay or the ability to estimate our future effective tax rate because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate. The U.S. government and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\") have proposed tax policy changes with respect to the taxation of global operations of multinational companies. As a result, our actual effective tax rate or taxes paid may vary materially from our expectations. Changes in tax laws, regulations and related interpretations in the countries in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nProduct quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins and net income.\nIn general, we warranty our products for varying lengths of time against non-conformance to our specifications and certain other defects. Because our products, including hardware, software and intellectual property cores, are highly complex and increasingly incorporate advanced technology, our quality assurance programs may not detect all defects, whether manufacturing defects in individual products or systematic defects that could affect numerous shipments. Inability to detect a defect could result in a diversion of our engineering resources from product development efforts, increased engineering expenses to remediate the defect and increased costs due to customer accommodation or inventory impairment charges. On occasion we have also repaired or replaced certain components or made software fixes or refunded the purchase price or license fee paid by our customers due to product or software defects. If there are significant product defects, the costs to remediate such defects, net of reimbursed amounts from our vendors, if any, or to resolve warranty claims may adversely affect our revenue, gross margins and net income.\nThe nature of our business makes our revenue and gross margin subject to fluctuation and difficult to predict which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition to the challenging market conditions we may face, we have limited visibility into the demand for our products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends upon our products being designed into our end customers' products and those products achieving market acceptance. Due to the complexity of our customers' designs, the design to volume production process for many of our customers requires a substantial amount of time, frequently longer than a year. In addition, we are dependent upon \"turns,\" orders received and turned for shipment in the same quarter. These factors make it difficult for us to forecast future sales and project quarterly revenues. The difficulty in forecasting future sales weakens our ability to project our inventory requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted, in inventory write-downs or failure to meet customer product demands in a timely manner. The difficulty in forecasting revenues as well as the relative customer and product mix of those revenues inhibits our ability to provide forward-looking revenue and gross margin guidance.\nReductions in the average selling prices of our products could have a negative impact on our gross margins.\nThe average selling prices of our products generally decline as the products mature or may decline as we compete for market share or customer acceptance in competitive markets. We seek to offset the decrease in selling prices through yield improvement, manufacturing cost reductions and increased unit sales. We also seek to continue to develop higher value products or product features that increase, or slow the decline of, the average selling price of our products. However, we cannot guarantee that our ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the decline in selling prices of our products, which could ultimately lead to a decline in revenues and have a negative effect on our gross margins.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our financial results and our ability to compete effectively may suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology and the representations of technologies that we acquire, and we rely\nupon patent, copyright, trade secret, mask work and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. We intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology, however, we may be unsuccessful in asserting our intellectual property rights or such rights may be invalidated, violated, circumvented or challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have asserted against us patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us. Third parties may attempt to misappropriate our intellectual property through electronic or other means or assert infringement claims against us in the future. Such assertions by third parties may result in costly litigation, indemnity claims or other legal actions, and we may not prevail in such matters or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms. This could result in the loss of our ability to import and sell our products or require us to pay costly royalties to third parties in connection with sales of our products. Any infringement claim, indemnification claim, or impairment or loss of use of our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation and unfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nFrom time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Certain claims are not yet resolved, including those that are discussed under Note 15 contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention and we may enter into material settlements to avoid these risks. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and certain portions of our business.\nIf we are not able to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely affected.\nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, manufacturing, marketing and sales resources. The current level of competition in the programmable logic market is high and may increase in the future. We currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our technology or have developed similar products, including Altera Corporation and Xilinx, Inc. We also compete with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products based on alternative solutions such as ASIC, ASSP, microcontroller, analog, and Digital Signal Processing (\"DSP\") technologies. Competition from these semiconductor companies may intensify as we offer products in the Consumer end market. These competitors include established, multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies. If we are unable to compete successfully in this environment, our future results may be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon a third party to provide inventory management, order fulfillment, and direct sales logistics and disruption of these services could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on a third party vendor to provide cost-effective and efficient supply chain services. Among other activities, these outsourced services relate to direct sales logistics, including order fulfillment, inventory management and warehousing, and distribution of inventory to third party distributors. If our third party supply chain partner were to discontinue services for us or its operations are disrupted as a result of a fire, earthquake, act of terrorism, political unrest, governmental uncertainty, war, disease or other natural disaster or catastrophic event, or any other reason, our ability to fulfill direct sales orders and distribute inventory timely, cost effectively, or at all, would be hindered, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on independent software and hardware developers and disruption of these services could negatively affect our operations and financial results.\nWe rely on independent software and hardware developers for the design, development, supply and support of intellectual property cores, design and development software, and certain elements of evaluation boards. As a result, failure or significant delay to complete software or deliver hardware in accordance with our plans, specifications, and agreements could disrupt the release of or introduction of new or existing products, which could be detrimental to the capability of our new products to win designs. Any of these delays or inability to complete the design or development could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nWe rely on information technology systems, and failure of these systems to function properly or our failure to control unauthorized access to our systems may cause business disruptions.\nWe rely in part on various information technology (\"IT\") systems to manage our operations, including financial reporting, and we regularly make changes to improve them as necessary. Consequently, we periodically implement new, or upgrade or enhance existing, operational and IT systems, procedures and controls. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. These systems are also subject to power and telecommunication outages or other general system failures. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties in managing them could result in excessive cost or business disruption.\nWe may also be subject to unauthorized access to our IT systems through a security breach or attack. In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Over the past year, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and to assess the damage caused by them.\nWe have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to address the potential risks. While we believe that our IT systems are appropriately controlled and that we have processes in place to adequately manage these risks, security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe. In the past third parties have attempted to penetrate and or infect our network and systems with malicious software in an effort to gain access to our network and systems. We seek to prevent, detect and investigate any security incidents and prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.\nThese data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. Our reputation and business could be significantly harmed, and we could be subject to third party claims in the event of such a security breach.\nWe may have failed to adequately insure against certain risks, and, as a result, our financial condition and results may be adversely affected.\nWe carry insurance customary for companies in our industry, including, but not limited to, liability, property and casualty, workers' compensation and business interruption insurance. We also insure our employees for basic medical expenses. In addition, we have insurance contracts that provide director and officer liability coverage for our directors and officers. Other than the specific areas mentioned above, we are self-insured with respect to most other risks and exposures, and the insurance we carry in many cases is subject to a significant policy deductible or other limitation before coverage applies. Based on management's assessment and judgment, we have determined that it is more cost effective to self-insure against certain risks than to incur the insurance premium costs. The risks and exposures for which we self-insure include, but are not limited to, certain natural disasters, certain product defects, political risk, certain theft, patent infringement and employment practice matters. Should there be a catastrophic loss due to an uninsured event such as an earthquake or a loss due to adverse occurrences in any area in which we are self-insured, our financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of, or inability to attract, such personnel would harm us.\nWe depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and other technical personnel. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain such personnel and attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product engineers. Competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing qualified personnel. From time to time we have effected restructurings which have eliminated a number of positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and our ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future. If we lose existing qualified personnel or are unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nThe conflict minerals provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act could result in additional costs and liabilities.\nAs part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission established new disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use \"conflict\" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. As these new requirements are fully implemented, they could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our semiconductor products. There are also costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, including for due diligence in regard to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of any required remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Although we filed our first conflict minerals report in 2014, it may be several years before we can fully assess the internal and external cost of compliance of the effect the rules will have on our business.", "PERMNO": 75854, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "LSCC"}
