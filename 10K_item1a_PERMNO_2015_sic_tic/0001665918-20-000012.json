{"cik": "1665918", "company": "US Foods Holding Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nWe are subject to many risks and uncertainties. Some of these risks and uncertainties, including those described below, may cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to vary, and they may materially or adversely affect our financial performance. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other risks and uncertainties, which are not currently known to us or which we currently believe are immaterial, may also materially or adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nOur business is a low-margin business, and our profitability is directly affected by cost deflation or inflation, commodity volatility and other factors.\nThe U.S. foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins. Volatile commodity costs have a direct impact on our industry. We make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell, plus a margin percentage or markup. As a result, our profit levels may be negatively affected during periods of product cost deflation, even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation also may reduce our profit margins and earnings if product cost increases cannot be passed on to customers because they resist paying higher prices. In addition, periods of rapid inflation may have a negative effect on our business. There may be a lag between the time of the price increase and the time at which we are able to pass it along to customers, as well as the impact it may have on discretionary spending by consumers.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe U.S. foodservice distribution industry is highly competitive, with national, multi-regional, regional and local distributors and specialty competitors. Regional and local companies often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups, with the goal of enhancing their geographic reach, private label offerings, overall purchasing power, cost efficiencies, and ability to meet customer distribution requirements. These distributors may also rely on local presence as a source of competitive advantage, and they may have lower costs and other competitive advantages due to geographic proximity. Additionally, adjacent competition, such as cash-and-carry operations, commercial wholesale outlets, warehouse clubs and grocery stores, continue to serve the commercial foodservice market. We also experience competition from online direct food wholesalers and retailers. We generally do not have exclusive service agreements with our customers, and they may switch to other suppliers that offer lower prices or differentiated products or customer service. The cost of switching suppliers is very low, as are the barriers to entry into the U.S. foodservice distribution industry. We believe most purchasing decisions in the U.S. foodservice distribution industry are based on the type, quality and price of the product, plus a distributor\u2019s ability to completely and accurately fill orders and provide timely deliveries.\nIncreased competition has caused the U.S. foodservice distribution industry to change as distributors seek to lower costs, further increasing pressure on the industry\u2019s profit margins. Heightened competition among our suppliers, significant pricing initiatives and discount programs established by competitors, new entrants, and trends toward consolidation and vertical integration could create additional competitive pressures that reduce margins and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on third party suppliers, and our business may be affected by interruption of supplies or increases in product costs.\nWe obtain most of our foodservice and related products from third party suppliers. We typically do not have long-term contracts with suppliers. Although our purchasing volume can provide an advantage when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies we need in the quantities and at the time and prices requested. We do not control the actual production of most of the products we sell. This means we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on actions and conditions outside our control. These actions and conditions include changes in supplier pricing practices (including promotional allowances); work slowdowns, work interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers; severe weather and climate conditions; crop conditions; outbreak of food-borne illnesses; product recalls; transportation interruptions; unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs; competitive demands; and natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products because of any of these or other factors could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to our customers and, as a result, our customers may turn to other distributors.\nOur relationships with our customers and GPOs may be materially diminished, terminated or otherwise changed, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our customers buy from us pursuant to individual purchase orders, and we often do not enter into long-term agreements with these customers. Because these customers are not contractually obligated to continue purchasing products from us, we cannot be assured that the volume and/or number of our customers\u2019 purchase orders will remain consistent or increase or that we will be able to maintain our existing customer base.\nFurther, some of our customers purchase their products under arrangements with GPOs. GPOs act as agents on behalf of their members by negotiating pricing, delivery, and other terms with us. Our customers who are members of GPOs purchase products directly from us on the terms negotiated by their GPO. GPOs use the combined purchasing power of their members to negotiate more favorable prices than their members would typically be able to negotiate on their own, and we have experienced some pricing pressure from customers which associate themselves with a GPO. While no single customer represented more than 3% of our total net sales in fiscal year 2019, approximately 25% of our net sales in fiscal year 2019 were made to customers under terms negotiated by GPOs (including approximately 13% of our net sales in fiscal year 2019 that were made to customers that are members of one GPO). If an independent restaurant customer becomes a member of a GPO that has a contract with us, we may be forced to lower our prices to that customer, which would negatively impact our operating margin. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our relationships with GPOs, or if GPOs are able to negotiate more favorable terms for their members with our competitors, we could lose some or all of that business.\nMarket competition, customer requirements, customer financial condition and customer consolidation through mergers and acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand our relationships with customers and GPOs. There is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements, maintain relationships with any of our customers or GPOs on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers. Our customer and GPO agreements are generally terminable upon advance written notice (typically ranging from 30 days to six months) by either us or the customer or GPO, which provides our customers and GPOs with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to award more business to our competitors.\nSignificant decreases in the volume and/or number of our customers\u2019 purchase orders, the loss of one or more of our major customers or GPOs or our inability to grow to our current customer base could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may fail to increase or maintain the highest margin portions of our business, including sales to independent restaurant customers and sales of our private label products.\nOur most profitable customers are independent restaurants. We tend to work closely with independent restaurant customers, providing them access to our customer value-added tools and as a result are able to earn a higher operating margin on sales to them. These customers are also more likely to purchase our private label products, which are our most profitable products. Our ability to continue to gain market share of independent restaurant customers is critical to achieving increased operating profits. Changes in the buying practices of independent restaurant customers, including their ability to require us to sell to them at discounted rates, or decreases in our sales to this type of customer or a decrease in the sales of our private label products could have a material negative impact on our profitability.\nWe may fail to realize the expected benefits of acquisitions or effectively integrate the businesses we acquire.\nHistorically, a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions. In September 2019, we completed the acquisition of the Food Group, which significantly expands the Company\u2019s network in the West and Northwest parts of the U.S.\nIf we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated synergies in a timely manner, we may not realize our projected return on investment and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Integrating acquired businesses may be more difficult in a region or market where we have limited expertise or with a company culture or operating structure different than ours. A significant acquisition, in terms of geography or magnitude, could strain our administrative and operational resources. We also may be unable to retain qualified management and other key personnel of the acquired businesses, which may be necessary to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated synergies in a timely manner.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect from our cost savings initiatives.\nWe may not be able to realize some or all of our expected cost savings. A variety of factors could cause us not to realize expected cost savings, including, among others, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost savings initiatives, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time, and unexpected costs associated with operating our business. All of these factors could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuel costs may fluctuate, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHigher costs of fuel may negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending. This may reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home. In addition, higher costs of fuel may increase the price we pay for products and the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers. We require significant quantities of fuel for our vehicle fleet, and the price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. Although, from time to time, we enter into forward purchase commitments for some of our fuel requirements at prices equal to the then-current market price, these forward purchases may prove ineffective in protecting us from changes in fuel prices or even result in us paying higher than market costs for part\nof our fuel. There is no guarantee that we will be able to pass along increased fuel costs to customers in the future. These factors may, in turn, adversely affect our sales, margins, operating expenses, and operating results.\nAn economic downturn, or other factors affecting consumer confidence, may reduce the amount of food prepared and consumed away from home, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. foodservice distribution industry is sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions. In the past, an uneven level of general U.S. economic activity, uncertainty in the financial markets, and slow job growth had a negative impact on consumer confidence and discretionary spending. A decline in economic activity or the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home, as well as other macroenvironmental factors which could decrease general consumer confidence (including volatile financial markets or an uncertain political environment), may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in consumer eating habits may reduce demand for our products.\nChanges in consumer eating habits (such as a decline in consuming food away from home, a decline in portion sizes, or a shift in preferences toward restaurants that are not our customers) could reduce demand for our products. Consumer eating habits could be affected by a number of factors, including changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods. There is a growing consumer preference for sustainable, organic and locally grown products. Changing consumer eating habits also occur due to generational shifts. Millennials, the largest demographic group in the U.S. in terms of spend, generally seek new and different, as well as more ethnic and diverse, menu options and menu innovation. If consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. Changing consumer eating habits may reduce the frequency with which consumers purchase meals outside of the home. Additionally, changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment or amendment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products, or laws and regulations requiring us to make additional disclosure regarding the nutritional content of our food products. Compliance with these and other laws and regulations may be costly and time-consuming. If we are not able to effectively adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits or respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or resulting new laws and regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nNegative publicity or an event which calls into question the safety or integrity of the products we distribute may adversely impact our reputation and business.\nMaintaining a good reputation and the safety and integrity of the products we distribute is critical to our business, particularly in selling our private label products. Any event that damages our reputation or calls into question the safety or integrity of our products, whether justified or not, could quickly and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This includes negative publicity about the quality, safety, sustainability or integrity of our products. Reports, whether or not they are true, of food-borne illnesses (such as e. coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, salmonella or swine flu) and injuries caused by food tampering could severely injure our reputation and reduce public confidence in our products. If patrons of our customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, the customers could be forced to temporarily close locations and our sales would correspondingly decrease. We may be subject to mandatory or voluntary product recalls or withdrawals. In addition, instances of food-borne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns, even those unrelated to our products, can result in negative publicity about the U.S. foodservice distribution industry and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to labor relations and costs.\nWe had approximately 28,000 employees as of December 28, 2019, of which approximately 5,000 were members of local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations. Our failure to effectively renegotiate any CBAs could result in work stoppages. From time to time, we may face increased efforts to subject us to multi-location labor disputes, as individual labor agreements expire or labor disputes arise. This would place us at greater risk of being unable to continue to operate one or more facilities, possibly delaying deliveries, causing customers to seek alternative suppliers, or otherwise being materially adversely affected by labor disputes. When there are labor related issues at a facility represented by a local union, sympathy strikes may occur at other facilities that are represented by other local unions. While we generally believe we have good relations with our employees, including the unions that represent some of our employees, a work stoppage due to a failure to renegotiate union contracts or for other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, potential changes in labor legislation and case law could result in current non-union portions of our workforce, including warehouse and delivery personnel, being subjected to greater organized labor influence. If additional portions of our workforce became subject to CBAs, this could result in increased costs of doing business as we would become subject to mandatory, binding arbitration or labor scheduling, costs and standards, which may reduce our operating flexibility.\nWe are subject to a wide range of labor costs. Because our industry's labor costs are, as a percentage of net sales, higher than many other industries' labor costs, even if we are able to successfully renegotiate CBAs and avoid work stoppages, we may be significantly impacted\nby labor cost increases. In addition, labor is a significant cost of many of our customers in the U.S. food-away-from-home industry. Any increase in their labor costs, including any increases in costs as a result of increases in minimum wage requirements, could reduce the profitability of our customers and reduce their demand for our products.\nWe may be unable to attract or retain a qualified and diverse workforce.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Recruiting and retention efforts (particularly with respect to driver and warehouse personnel) and actions to increase productivity may not be successful, and we could encounter a shortage of qualified employee talent in the future. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate qualified employee talent to meet our business needs. A labor shortage could potentially increase labor costs, reduce our profitability and/or decrease our ability to effectively serve customers.\nIf our competitors implement a lower cost structure and offer lower prices to our customers, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to compete profitably and retain those customers.\nOver the last several decades, the U.S. food retail industry has undergone significant change. Companies such as Wal-Mart and Costco have developed a lower cost structure, providing their customers with an everyday low-cost product offering. In addition, commercial wholesale outlets, such as Restaurant Depot, offer an additional low-cost option in the markets they serve. As a large-scale U.S. foodservice distributor, we have similar strategies to remain competitive in the marketplace by reducing our cost structure. However, to the extent more of our competitors adopt an everyday low price strategy, we would potentially be pressured to offer lower prices to our customers. That would require us to achieve additional cost savings to offset these reductions. If we are unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in that environment, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nChanges in applicable tax laws and regulations and the resolution of tax disputes may negatively affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and various state and local jurisdictions, and changes in tax laws or regulations or tax rulings may have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate. The U.S. and many state and local jurisdictions where we do business have recently enacted or are actively considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. federal income tax code, the impacts of which are described elsewhere in this Annual Report. Given the unpredictability of possible changes to U.S. federal and state and local tax laws and regulations, it is very difficult to predict their cumulative effect on our results of operations and cash flows, but new and changed laws and regulations could adversely impact our results of operations. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other state and local tax authorities and governmental bodies, for which we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome. If the ultimate determination of these examinations is that taxes are owed by us for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to significant government regulation, and failure to comply with applicable government regulations may lead to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations.\nOur operations are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. These laws and regulations govern many issues, including discharges to air, soil and water; the handling and disposal of hazardous substances; the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from the release of petroleum products and other hazardous substances; employee health and safety; food safety and quality; and fleet safety. In the course of our operations, we process, handle and transport a wide variety of food and non-food products, operate and maintain vehicle fleets, use and dispose of hazardous substances, and store fuel in on-site aboveground and underground storage tanks. At several current and former facilities, we are investigating and remediating known or suspected contamination from historical releases of fuel and other hazardous substances that is not currently the subject of any administrative or judicial proceeding, but we may be subject to administrative or judicial proceedings in the future for contamination related to releases of fuel or other hazardous substances. Some jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations that affect the composition and operation of truck fleets, such as limits on diesel emissions and engine idling. A number of our facilities have ammonia or freon-based refrigeration systems, propane, and battery powered forklifts, which could cause injury or environmental damage. Proposed or recently enacted legal requirements, such as those requiring the phase-out of certain ozone-depleting substances or otherwise regulating greenhouse gas emissions, may require us to upgrade or replace equipment or may otherwise increase our operating costs. We are additionally subject to governmental regulation in many other areas of our business, including trade, minimum wage, overtime, wage payment, wage and hour and employment discrimination, immigration and anticorruption. As an example, due to contracts we have with federal and state governmental entities, governmental agencies have, from time to time, conducted audits of or requested information regarding our pricing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts.\nFailing to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, or encountering disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulation, could result in a number of adverse situations. These could include investigations; litigation or other legal\nproceedings; administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or fines; mandatory or voluntary product recalls; cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance; closing facilities or operations; debarments from contracting with governmental entities; and loss or modification of existing, or rejection of additional, licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals. These laws and regulations may change in the future. The costs of compliance and consequences of non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the products we distribute are alleged to have caused injury, illness or other damage or to have failed to comply with applicable government regulations, we may need to recall products and may experience product liability claims.\nAs a distributor and manufacturer of food, we may be subject to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals, if the products we distribute or manufacture are alleged to have caused injury, illness or other damage, to have been mislabeled, misbranded or adulterated or to otherwise have violated applicable governmental regulations. We may also choose to voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards, whether for taste, appearance or otherwise, in order to protect our brand and reputation. Any future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures, destruction of product inventory, damage to our reputation and/or lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to potential product liability claims in the event that the products we distribute or manufacture are alleged to have caused injury, illness or other damage. We believe we have sufficient liability insurance to cover product liability claims. We also generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying products to us. If our current insurance does not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or is inadequate to cover all of our liabilities, or if our indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, by the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party or the insured limits of our suppliers\u2019 insurance coverage, the liability related to defective products we distribute or manufacture could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we are or may be involved in the normal course of our business could limit our ability to operate our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of our business, we are involved in various legal proceedings. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these proceedings were determined adversely to us or require a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we could become the subject of future claims by third parties, including our employees, suppliers, customers, GPOs, investors, or regulators. Any significant adverse judgments or settlements could reduce our profits and limit our ability to operate our business.\nWe rely heavily on technology, and we may experience a disruption in existing technology or delay in effectively implementing new technology.\nOur ability to control costs and maximize profits, as well as to serve customers most effectively, depends on the reliability of our information technology systems and related data entry processes in our transaction intensive business. We rely on software and other information technology to manage significant aspects of our business, such as purchasing, order processing, warehouse/inventory management, truck loading and logistics and optimization of storage space. Any disruption to this information technology could negatively affect our customer service, decrease the volume of our business, and result in increased costs. We have invested in and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, business continuity, and disaster recovery plans in order to insulate ourselves from technology disruption that could impair operations and profits.\nInformation technology evolves rapidly. To compete effectively, we are required to integrate new technologies in a timely and cost-effective manner. If competitors implement new technologies before we do, allowing them to provide lower priced or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA cybersecurity incident may negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, to process online credit card payments, and to manage or support virtually all of our business processes and activities. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees, customers, suppliers and other business partners. These uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft, online platform hijacking that could redirect online credit card payments to another credit card processing website, and inadvertent or unauthorized release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including personal information of customers and suppliers, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners. We are also expanding and improving our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding increase in exposure to cybersecurity risk. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security\nbreaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability, and competitive disadvantage, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur retirement benefits may give rise to significant expenses and liabilities in the future.\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. These pension and postretirement obligations give rise to costs that are dependent on various assumptions, including those discussed in Note 18, Retirement Plans, in our consolidated financial statements, many of which are outside of our control, such as performance of financial markets, interest rates, participant age and mortality. In the event we determine that our assumptions should be revised, our future pension and postretirement plan benefit costs could increase or decrease. The assumptions we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement obligations and related costs and funding requirements.\nIn addition to the plans we sponsor, we also contribute to various multiemployer pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. In the event that we withdraw from participating in one of these plans-including by deciding to discontinue participation in a plan in the ordinary course renegotiation of a CBA or by reducing the number of employees participating in a plan to a certain degree over a certain period of time as a result of a facility closure or other change in our operations-then applicable law could require us to make additional withdrawal liability payments to the plan based on the applicable plan\u2019s funding status. Some multiemployer plans, including ones to which we contribute, are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities, which could increase the size of potential withdrawal liability. Any withdrawal liability payments that we are required to make could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExtreme weather conditions and natural disasters, and other catastrophic events, may interrupt our business, or our customers\u2019 or suppliers' businesses.\nSome of our facilities and our customers\u2019 and suppliers' facilities are located in areas that may be subject to extreme, and occasionally prolonged, weather conditions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, and extreme cold. Extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations in such areas. Furthermore, extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our customers\u2019 facilities, reduce the number of consumers who visit our customers\u2019 facilities, interrupt our suppliers\u2019 production or shipments or increase our suppliers\u2019 product costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our business could be affected by large-scale terrorist acts or the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities (especially those directed against or otherwise involving the U.S.), the outbreak of food-borne illnesses, the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases or the occurrence of other catastrophic events. Any of these events could impair our ability to manage our business and/or cause disruption of economic activity, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on trademarks, trade secrets, and other forms of intellectual property protections, which may not be adequate to protect us from misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the U.S. We have applied for registration of a limited number of trademarks in the U.S. and in certain other countries, some of which have been registered or issued. We cannot guarantee that our applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities, or that third parties will not seek to oppose or otherwise challenge our registrations or applications. We also rely on unregistered proprietary rights, including common law trademark protection. Third parties may use trademarks identical or confusingly similar to ours, or independently develop trade secrets or know-how similar or equivalent to ours. If our proprietary information is divulged to third parties, including our competitors, or our intellectual property rights are otherwise misappropriated or infringed, our business could be harmed or adversely affected.\nOur products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products.\nWe cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe intellectual property rights of others. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with their use of our products. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our management and personnel. Moreover, if we were found liable for infringement or enter into a settlement, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all), pay damages or cease making or selling certain products, which could cause us to incur significant costs and/or prevent us from selling or manufacturing certain products.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to raise additional capital or obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business, and make required payments on our debt.\nWe had $4,736 million of indebtedness, net of $43 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, as of December 28, 2019.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our debt facilities depends on our ongoing financial and operating performance, among other things, and may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control, including as discussed under the caption \u201cRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\u201d above. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, raise additional equity capital or restructure our debt. However, there is no assurance that such alternative measures may be successful or permitted under the agreements governing our indebtedness and, as a result, we may not be able to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flows from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nwe are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because approximately 65% of the net principal amount of our borrowings was at variable rates of interest as of December 28, 2019;\n\u2022\nit may be difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our lenders, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or more favorable interest rates and they, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand competitive pressures and general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance indebtedness and obtain additional financing may be limited or the associated costs of refinancing and obtaining additional financing may increase.\nOur indebtedness may further increase from time to time and we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured debt, in the future for various reasons. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Incurring substantial additional indebtedness could further exacerbate the risks associated with our level of indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that may significantly impact our ability to operate our business.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to: dispose of assets; incur additional indebtedness (including guarantees of additional indebtedness); pay dividends and make certain payments; create liens on assets; make investments; engage in certain business combination transactions; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; change the business we conduct; and amend specific debt agreements. In addition, these agreements subject us to various financial covenants.\nThe restrictions under the agreements governing our indebtedness may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive and financial covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure that we will be granted waivers of or amendments to these obligations if for any reason we are unable to comply with them, or that we will be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness depends on our ongoing financial and operating performance, among other things, and may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control, including as discussed under the caption \u201cRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\u201d above. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the agreements governing our indebtedness that would permit the applicable lenders or note holders, as the case may be, to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay debt, lenders having secured obligations could proceed against the collateral securing the debt. In any such case, we may be unable to borrow under and may not be able to repay the amounts due under our indebtedness. This\ncould have serious consequences to our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nChanges in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect the cost of servicing our debt.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that it intends to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. Amounts drawn under each of our asset based senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d), accounts receivable financing facility (the \u201cABS Facility\u201d) and initial and incremental senior secured term loan facilities (the \u201cInitial Term Loan Facility\u201d and the \u201cIncremental Term Loan Facility,\u201d respectively) may bear interest at rates based upon, among other things, U.S. dollar LIBOR. As such, depending on the future of LIBOR, we may need to renegotiate certain standards in or terms of the agreements governing this indebtedness to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new standard or we may be required to borrow this indebtedness based upon alternate interest rate conventions as set forth in those agreements, which could increase the cost of servicing this debt and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16084, "SIC": 5140, "TIC": "USFD"}
