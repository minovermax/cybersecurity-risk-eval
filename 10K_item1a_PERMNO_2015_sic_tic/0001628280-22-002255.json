{"cik": "48898", "company": "HUBBELL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A Risk Factors\nOur business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to those set forth below. Any one of these factors could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or future anticipated results. See also Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis - \u201cExecutive Overview of the Business\u201d and \u201cResults of Operations\u201d.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nOur business and operations, and the operations of our suppliers, have been, and may in the future be adversely affected by epidemics or pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.\nWe may face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics or other outbreaks of communicable diseases. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, including significant volatility in the capital markets. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations, financial results and the trading price of our common stock will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, as there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the potential effect of the spread of a global pandemic. These include: the duration and scope and possible resurgence of the pandemic or continued emergence of new strains of COVID-19, such as the Delta and Omicron variants; the availability of an effective vaccine and the speed with which it is administered to the public; governmental, business individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including mitigation efforts such as stay at home and other social distancing orders) and the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response (including stimulus efforts such as the Families First Coronavirus Act and the CARES Act).\nA public health epidemic or pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, poses the risk that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities, or that such epidemic may otherwise interrupt or impair business activities.\nWe have adjusted standard operating procedures within our business operations to ensure continued safety of those within our locations and are continually monitoring evolving health guidelines, as well as market conditions, and responding to changes as appropriate; however, we cannot be certain that these efforts will prevent further disruption due to shutdowns or other pandemic mitigation efforts and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. This situation is changing continually, and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider to be significant risks to our operations. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant global supply chain shortages for materials and component parts used in our products and associated escalating prices. In addition to supply shortages, constrained transportation capacities have led to significant price increases in transportation costs. We expect to continue to be affected by supply chain issues due to factors largely beyond our control, including, a global shortage of semi-conductors, chips and components used in our products, a strain on raw materials and cost inflation, all of which could escalate in future quarters.\nAlthough economic conditions have generally improved during 2021, the strength of the economic recovery is uncertain and may vary across industries, customers and from country to country. The ultimate extent and robustness of any economic recovery from the impact of the pandemic imposes a significant degree of uncertainty and complexity, and may adversely affect our operations, customer demand and our costs of production. Failure of economic recovery to continue and adverse or weakening economic conditions may also result in deterioration in the collection of customer accounts receivable, as well as a reduction in sales.\nNew regulations on employers concerning COVID-19 vaccination mandates or testing of U.S.-based employees could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOn November 5, 2021, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued an emergency testing standard (ETS), which required employers with 100 or more employees to develop, implement and enforce a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy, unless they adopt a policy requiring employees to choose to either be vaccinated or undergo regular COVID-19 testing. Although the ETS was withdrawn effective January 26, 2022 OSHA is not withdrawing the ETS as a proposed rule. We cannot currently predict the impact the OSHA proposed rule, if adopted, or any executive order that may be issued in the future would have on our workforce, and additional vaccine mandates may be announced within the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate. However, the implementation of these requirements may result in an increase in attrition rates or absenteeism within our skilled labor force, challenges securing future labor needs, inefficiencies connected to employee turnover, and costs associated with implementation and on-going compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nHUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\nIndustry and Economic Risks\nWe operate in markets that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect selling prices or demand for our products.\nWe compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price. Competitors' behavior related to these areas could potentially have significant impacts on our financial results. Our competitive strategy is to design and manufacture high quality products at the lowest possible cost. Our strategy is to also increase selling prices to offset rising costs of raw materials and components. Competitive pricing pressures may not allow us to offset some or all of our increased costs through pricing actions. Alternatively, if raw material and component costs decline, the Company may not be able to maintain current pricing levels. Competition could also affect future selling prices or demand for our products which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nVolatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur international operations accounted for approximately 9% of our Net sales in 2021. We are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on translating the financial statements of our international operations, most of which are denominated in local currencies, into the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our international operations. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products, along with other local costs incurred in foreign countries for foreign entities with U.S. dollar functional currency. As a result, fluctuating exchange rates may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nUncertainty about the future of the London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\") may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur 2021 Credit Facility uses LIBOR as a reference rate, such that the interest due pursuant to such borrowings may be calculated using LIBOR plus an applicable margin (determined by reference to a ratings based grid) or the alternate base rate. In March 2021, the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that most tenors of the USD LIBOR, rates will cease to be published after June 30, 2023, and one-week and two-month LIBOR will cease being published December 31, 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect of this announcement, including what alternative reference rates may replace LIBOR in use going forward, and how LIBOR will be determined for purposes of loans, securities and derivative instruments currently referencing it when it ceases to exist. Once LIBOR is no longer available, if lenders have increased costs due to such changes, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our floating rate debt. These uncertainties or their resolution also could negatively impact our funding costs, loan and other asset values, asset-liability management strategies, and other aspects of our business and financial results.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nOur ability to effectively develop and introduce new products could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nNew product introductions and enhancement of existing products and services are key to the Company\u2019s competitive strategy. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, timely and successful development of new products, including software development, market acceptance of these products and the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with these introductions. These risks include development and production capabilities, management of inventory levels to support anticipated demand, the risk that new products may have quality defects in the early stages of introduction, and obsolescence risk of existing products. The Company cannot predict with certainty the ultimate impact new product introductions could have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe manufacture and source products and materials from various countries throughout the world. A disruption in the availability, price or quality of these products or materials could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with global manufacturing and sourcing. We use a variety of raw materials in the production of our products including steel, aluminum, brass, copper, bronze, zinc, nickel, plastics, phenolics, elastomers and petrochemicals. We also purchase certain electrical and electronic components, including solenoids, lighting ballasts, printed circuit boards, integrated circuit chips and cord sets from a number of suppliers. Significant shortages in the availability of these materials or significant price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations. See also Risk Factor, \u201cSignificant developments from the recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies could have a material adverse effect on us.\u201d\nWe rely on materials, components and finished goods that are sourced from or manufactured in foreign countries including Mexico, China, and other international countries. Political instability in any country where we do business could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe rely on our suppliers to produce high quality materials, components and finished goods according to our specifications, including timely delivery. There is a risk that products may not meet our quality control procedure specifications which could adversely affect our ability to ship quality products to our customers on a timely basis and, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nHUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $2,552.8 million. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments both within and outside the Company\u2019s control. Deteriorating economic conditions, technological changes, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, intensified competition, divestitures, market capitalization declines and other factors may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations in the periods an impairment is recognized.\nWe engage in acquisitions and strategic investments and may encounter difficulty in obtaining appropriate acquisitions and in integrating these businesses.\nPart of the Company\u2019s growth strategy involves acquisitions. We have pursued and will continue to seek acquisitions and other strategic investments to complement and expand our existing businesses. The rate and extent to which acquisitions become available may affect our growth rate. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these businesses into our operations and realize the planned synergies. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions into our operations and in managing strategic investments and foreign acquisitions and joint ventures may also present additional risk related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages. Failure to effectively complete or manage acquisitions may adversely affect our existing businesses as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement initiatives, including our restructuring activities that improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs.\nAchieving our long-term profitability goals depends significantly on our ability to control or reduce our operating costs. Because many of our costs are affected by factors completely, or substantially outside our control, we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through productivity initiatives. If we are not able to identify and implement initiatives that control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency, or if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date do not generate expected cost savings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our efforts to control or reduce costs may include restructuring activities involving workforce reductions, facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits may be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks surrounding our information technology systems failures, network disruptions, breaches in data security and compliance with data privacy laws or regulations.\nWe are highly dependent on various software and information technology systems to record and process operational, human resources and financial transactions. The proper functioning of Hubbell\u2019s information technology systems is critical to the successful operation of our business. Our information technology systems are susceptible to cyber threats, malware, phishing attacks, break-ins and similar events, breaches of physical security or tampering and manipulation of these systems by employees or unauthorized third parties. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as smartphones and laptops, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. Hubbell may also be subject to disruptions of any of our systems and our vendor's systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as natural disasters, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, and electrical/telecommunications outages or failures. All of these risks are also applicable where Hubbell relies on outside vendors to provide services, which may operate in an on-line, or \u201ccloud,\u201d environment. A failure of our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventory, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses; all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information that may result in financial or reputational damage to the Company, as well as expose the Company to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\nHubbell also provides customers with solutions that include software components that allow for the control and/or the communication of data from those solutions to Hubbell or customer systems. In addition to the risks noted above, there are other risks associated with these solutions. For example, control and/or data from these solutions may be integral to a customer's operations. A failure of our technology to operate as designed or as a result of cyber threats could impact those operations, including by loss or destruction of data. Likewise, a customer\u2019s failure to properly configure its own network are outside of the Company\u2019s control and could result in a failure in functionality or security of our technology.\nHUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\nHubbell is also subject to an increasing number of evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations that impose requirements on the Company and our technology prior to certain use or transfer, storing, processing, disclosure, and protection of data and prior to sale or use of certain technologies. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties and other costs. For example, the European Union\u2019s implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation in 2018, the European Union\u2019s pending ePrivacy Regulation and the implementation of the ePrivacy Directive by the various European Union member states, and California\u2019s implementation of its Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and Connected Device Privacy Act of 2018, as well as data privacy statutes implemented by other states, could all disrupt our ability to sell products and solutions or use and transfer data because such activities may not be in compliance with applicable law in certain jurisdictions.\nWe have continued to work on improving our utilization of our enterprise resource planning system, expanding standardization of business processes and performing implementations at our remaining businesses, as well as acquired businesses. We expect to incur additional costs related to future implementations, process reengineering efforts as well as enhancements and upgrades to the system. These system modifications and implementations could result in operating inefficiencies which could adversely impact our operating results and/or our ability to perform necessary business transactions.\nSystem failures, ineffective system implementation or disruptions, failure to comply with data privacy and security laws or regulations, IT system risk arising from the Company's acquisition activity or the compromise of security with respect to internal or external systems or portable electronic devices could damage the Company\u2019s systems or infrastructure, subject us to liability claims, or regulatory fines, penalties, or intervention, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, disrupt customer operations, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur ability to access capital markets or failure to maintain our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to invest in our business and make strategic acquisitions may require access to the capital markets. If general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact our ability to access capital. Failure to maintain our credit ratings could also impact our ability to access credit markets and could increase our cost of borrowing. The capital and credit markets could deteriorate and market conditions could make it more difficult for us to access capital to finance our investments and acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDeterioration in the credit quality of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have an extensive customer base of distributors, wholesalers, electric utilities, OEMs, electrical contractors, telecommunications companies and retail and hardware outlets. We are not dependent on a single customer, however, our top ten customers account for approximately 42% of our Net sales. Deterioration in the credit quality of several major customers could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness; our indebtedness will increase if we incur additional indebtedness in the future and do not retire existing indebtedness.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. Our indebtedness level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including (i) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, (ii) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions and (iii) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.\nWe may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future. If we add new indebtedness and do not retire existing indebtedness, the risks described above could increase.\nIf the underlying investments of our defined benefit plans do not perform as expected, we may have to make additional contributions to these plans.\nWe sponsor certain pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact these plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, investment losses on plan assets and reductions in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets will be sufficient to meet future funding requirements.\nLegal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\nTax legislation may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe recent U.S. federal elections could provide an environment for future corporate tax legislative activity that could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, foreign jurisdictions may enact tax legislation that could alter the manner in which corporations are subject to tax in their jurisdictions that could significantly affect our ongoing operations.\nHUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\nBecause tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and uncertainty, tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently recorded by the Company.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The determination of the Company's worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires judgment and is based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in the various jurisdictions where the company operates. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in the Company's financial statements and may adversely affect the Company's financial results for the period when such determination is made. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provisions. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the future outcomes of these audits could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSignificant developments from the recent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOver the last four years, the U.S. government has announced and, in some cases, implemented a new approach to trade policy, including renegotiating, or potentially terminating, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"), which was replaced by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, on July 1, 2020, and proposed trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (\"TPP\"), from which the United States has formally withdrawn, as well as implementing the imposition of additional tariffs on certain foreign goods, including finished products and raw materials such as steel and aluminum. Changes in the U.S. trade policy, U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products, and any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot predict what changes to trade policy will be made by the current presidential administration and Congress, including whether existing tariff policies will be maintained or modified or whether the entry into new bilateral or multilateral trade agreements will occur, nor can we predict the effects that any conceivable changes would have on our business.\nWe rely on materials, components and finished goods, such as steel and aluminum, that are sourced from or manufactured in foreign countries, including China and Mexico. Import tariffs and potential import tariffs have resulted or may result in increased prices for these imported goods and materials and, in some cases, may result or have resulted in price increases for domestically sourced goods and materials. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted and could result in additional reactions from U.S. trading partners, including adopting responsive trade policies making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products or import goods and materials from those countries. These measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the U.S. or may cause us to adjust our worldwide supply chain. Either of these could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold.\nVarious countries, and regions, including, without limitation, China, Mexico, Canada and Europe, have announced plans or intentions to impose or have imposed tariffs on a wide range of U.S. products in retaliation for new U.S. tariffs. These actions could, in turn, result in additional tariffs being adopted by the U.S. These conditions and future actions could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States increase the price of, or limit the amount of, raw materials and finished goods imported into the United States, the costs of our raw materials may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products and services may be diminished, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impacts on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\nOur business and results of operations may be materially adversely effected by compliance with import and export laws.\nWe must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the import and export of products, services and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. The length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products or performance of services and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation. Moreover, any changes in export control or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. Any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit and related negative developments in the European Union and elsewhere could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). As a result of the referendum, the UK exited the EU on January 31, 2020 under a transitional trade arrangement (generally preserving the status quo) that was replaced by a definitive agreement at the end of 2020; however, the long-term effects of Brexit, including the UK's relationship with the EU and other countries, including the U.S., remains unclear. We conduct business in both the UK and EU and shipments from our UK subsidiaries represented 3% of our total Net sales in both 2021 and 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the UK, the EU and elsewhere. There can be no assurance that any or all of these events, or others that we cannot anticipate at this time, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could incur significant and/or unexpected costs in our efforts to successfully avoid, manage, defend and litigate intellectual property matters.\nThe Company relies on certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property of which the Company cannot be certain that others have not and will not infringe upon. Intellectual property litigation could be costly and time consuming and the Company could incur significant legal expenses pursuing these claims against others.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement. Any dispute or litigation involving intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims, the Company may lose its rights to utilize critical technology or may be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at a substantial cost, any of which could negatively impact our operating results. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement, we may incur significant costs that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. See Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for a discussion of our legal proceedings.\nWe are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that may adversely impact our operating results.\nWe are a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability, intellectual property and environmental matters, which could be significant. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim and lawsuit. In the future, we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, which insurance may not provide adequate coverage against such claims. We establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make additional payments, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for clean up or other costs or damages under environmental laws. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to climate change concerns. Compliance with any future laws and regulations could result in a materially adverse effect on our business and financial results. See Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for a discussion of our legal proceedings.\nHUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K\nOur reputation and our ability to conduct business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\nWe cannot provide absolute assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents. Any such improper actions could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigation in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigative fees.\nRegulations related to conflict-free minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and may create challenges with our customers.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability regarding the use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries (\u201cDRC\u201d). The SEC has established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use \u201cconflict\u201d minerals sourced from the DRC in their products. These new requirements could limit the pool of suppliers who can provide conflict-free minerals and as a result, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain these conflict-free minerals at competitive prices. Compliance with these new requirements may also increase our costs. In addition, we may face challenges with our customers if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in our products.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe face the potential harms of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations.\nNatural disasters, the economic uncertainty resulting from the spread of global pandemics, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, and the actions taken by the United States and other governments in response to such events could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers or our customers, and could create political or economic instability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could decrease demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products, or disrupt our supply chain.\nGlobal economic uncertainty could adversely affect us.\nDuring periods of prolonged slow growth, or a downturn in conditions in the worldwide or domestic economies, we could experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers. Depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the depth and breadth of personnel with the necessary skill set and experience, or the loss of key employees, could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategy.\nHUBBELL INCORPORATED - Form 10-K", "PERMNO": 32942, "SIC": 3640, "TIC": "HUBB"}
