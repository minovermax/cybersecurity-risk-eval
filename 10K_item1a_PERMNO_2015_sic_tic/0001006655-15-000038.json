{"cik": "1006655", "company": "EVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.\nRisks related to the oil and gas industry and our Company\nA substantial or extended decline in oil prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our oil heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil is a commodity and its price is subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. For example, average daily prices for WTI crude oil ranged from a high of $108 per barrel to a low of $44 per barrel during our fiscal year ending June 30, 2015. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and gas;\n\u2022\nactions of OPEC;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals of regional, domestic and international transportation availability;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nspeculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022\nprice and availability of competitors' supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances effecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nSubstantially all of our production is sold to purchasers under short-term (less than twelve-month) contracts at market-based prices. Low oil and natural gas prices will reduce our cash flows, borrowing ability, the present value of our reserves and our ability to develop future reserves. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms. Low oil and natural gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves. Because approximately 80% of our proved reserves at June 30, 2015 are crude oil reserves and 20% are natural gas liquids reserves, and almost 100% of our current production is crude oil, we are heavily impacted by movements in crude oil prices, which also influence natural gas liquids prices. To the extent that we have not\nhedged our production with derivative contracts or fixed-price contracts, any significant and extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial position.\nOur revenues are concentrated in one asset and declines in production or other events beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results.\nOver 99% of our revenues come from our royalty, mineral and working interests in the Delhi field in Louisiana and thus our current revenues are highly concentrated in this field. Any significant downturn in production, oil and gas prices, or other events beyond our control which impact the Delhi field could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results. We are not the operator of the Delhi field, and our revenues and future growth are heavily dependent on the success of operations, which we do not control.\nOperating results from oil and natural gas production may decline; we may be unable to acquire and develop the additional oil and natural gas reserves that are required in order to sustain our business operations.\nIn general, the volumes of production from crude oil and natural gas properties decline as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful development activities, or both, our proved reserves will decline. Our production is heavily dependent on our interests in EOR production that began during March 2010 in the Delhi Field. In addition, our production will be impacted by the results of wells in which we have installed our GARP\u00ae technology and any future installations in which we are compensated with production or its equivalent. Although EOR production from proved reserves at Delhi has and is expected to grow over time and we expect to grow the number of GARP\u00ae installations, environmental or operating problems or lack of future investment at Delhi, lack of success in adding GARP\u00ae installations or a change in our GARP\u00ae compensation model without further development activities in new or existing projects or without acquisitions of producing properties, our net production of oil and natural gas could decline significantly over time, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nSubstantially all of our properties, namely our Delhi interests, are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Operators of these properties may act in ways that are not in our best interest. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs, result in lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe types of resources we focus on have substantial operational risks.\nOur business plan focuses on the acquisition and development of known resources in partially depleted reservoirs, naturally fractured or low permeability reservoirs, or relatively shallow reservoirs. Shallower reservoirs usually have lower pressure, which translates into fewer natural gas volumes in place. Low permeability reservoirs require more wells and substantial stimulation for development of commercial production. Naturally fractured reservoirs require penetration of sufficient undepleted fractures to establish commercial production. Depleted reservoirs require successful application of newer technology to unlock incremental reserves.\nOur CO2-EOR project in the Delhi Field, operated by a subsidiary of Denbury Resources Inc., requires significant amounts of CO2 reserves, development capital and technical expertise, the sources of which to date have been committed by the operator. Although initial CO2 injection began at Delhi in November 2009, initial oil production response began in March 2010 and a large part of the capital budget has already been expended, additional capital remains to be invested to fully develop the EOR project,further increase production and maximize the value of the asset. The operator's failure to manage these and other technical, environmental, operating, strategic, financial and logistical risks may cause ultimate enhanced recoveries from the planned CO2-EOR project to fall short of our expectations in volume and/or timing. Such occurrences would have a material adverse effect on the Company, its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe existing well bores in which we are installing GARP\u00ae were originally drilled years or decades earlier. As such, they contain older casing or debris that could be more subject to failure, or the well files, if available, may be incomplete or incorrect. Such problems can result in the complete loss of a well or much higher costs. Expected results are based on theoretical estimates using historical data, which may not be complete or accurate, and thus such estimates may not prove accurate. Terms of compensation for installing GARP\u00ae may well change over time based on results achieved, industry acceptance, marketing efforts and other factors.\nOur projects generally require that we acquire new leases in and around established fields or other known resources, and drill and complete wells, some of which may be horizontal, as well as negotiate the purchase of existing well bores and production equipment or install our proprietary artificial lift technology that has yet to be universally proven. Leases may not be available and required oil field services may not be obtainable on the desired schedule or at the expected costs. While the projected drilling results may be considered to be low to moderate in risk, there is no assurance as to what productive results may be obtained, if any.\nCrude oil and natural gas development, re-completion of wells from one reservoir to another reservoir, restoring wells to production and drilling and completing new wells are speculative activities and involve numerous risks and substantial uncertain costs.\nOur growth will be materially dependent upon the success of our future development program. Drilling for crude oil and natural gas and re-working existing wells involve numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive crude oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\npressure fluctuations or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nenvironmental events;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain or maintain leases on economic terms, where applicable;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment.\nDrilling or re-working is a highly speculative activity. Even when fully and correctly utilized, modern well completion techniques such as horizontal drilling or CO2 injection or other injectants do not guarantee that we will find and produce crude oil and/or natural gas in our wells in economic quantities. Our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure would have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities within a particular geographic area will not decline.\nWe may also identify and develop prospects through a number of methods, some of which do not include horizontal drilling or tertiary injectants, and some of which may be unproven. The drilling and results for these prospects may be particularly uncertain. We cannot assure you that these projects can be successfully developed or that the wells discussed will, if drilled, encounter reservoirs of commercially productive crude oil or natural gas.\nThe loss of a large single purchaser of our oil and natural gas could reduce the competition of our production.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2015, one purchaser accounted for 99% of our oil and natural gas revenues. We do not currently market our share of crude oil production from the Delhi field. Although we have the right to take our working interest production in-kind, we are currently accepting terms under the Delhi operator's agreement with Plains Marketing L.P. for the delivery and pricing of our oil there. The loss of such large single purchaser for our oil and natural gas production could negatively impact the revenue we receive. We cannot assure you we could readily find other purchasers for our oil and natural gas production. In addition, the crude oil production from the Delhi field is transported by pipeline and if this pipeline transportation were disrupted and we were forced to use alternative transportation methods, our net realized pricing and potentially our near-term production levels could be adversely affected.\nOur patented GARP\u00ae technology may not achieve acceptance or widespread adoption by industry.\nWe have developed, field tested and initiated commercialization of our artificial lift technology, GARP\u00ae (Gas Assisted Rod Pump), though it may not generate substantial value. Our further success in commercializing the technology will depend upon additional positive field tests, additional customers, acceptance by industry and our ability to defend the technology from competitors through confidentiality, trade secret and patent protection.\nWe may be unable to continue licensing from third parties the technologies that we use in our business operations.\nAs is customary in the crude oil and natural gas industry, we utilize a variety of widely available technologies in the crude oil and natural gas development and drilling process. We do not have any patents or copyrights for the technology we currently utilize, except for the registered trademark and issued patent on our GARP\u00ae artificial lift technology that is in the process of commercialization. We generally license or purchase services from the holders of such technology, or outsource the technology integral to our business from third parties. Our commercial success will depend in part on these sources of\ntechnology and assumes that such sources will not infringe on the proprietary rights of others. We cannot be certain whether any third-party patents will require us to utilize or develop alternative technology or to alter our business plan, obtain additional licenses, or cease activities that infringe on third-parties' intellectual property rights. Our inability to acquire any third-party licenses, or to integrate the related third-party products into our business plan, could result in delays in development unless and until equivalent products can be identified, licensed, and integrated. Existing or future licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Litigation, which could result in substantial cost to us, may be necessary to enforce any patents licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party obligations or to protect our patent rights on GARP\u00ae.\nOur crude oil and natural gas reserves are only estimates and may prove to be inaccurate.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values. Our reserves are only estimates that may prove to be inaccurate because of these uncertainties. Reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves depend upon a number of variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas and assumptions concerning effects of regulations by governmental agencies, future crude oil and natural gas product prices, future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and work-over and remedial costs. Some or all of these assumptions may in fact vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected there from prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times, may vary substantially.\nAccordingly, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward adjustment. Actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and such variances may be material. The information regarding discounted future net cash flows included in this report should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production, supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas, increases or decreases in consumption, and changes in governmental regulations or taxation. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the crude oil and natural gas industry in general. PV-10 does not necessarily correspond to market value.\nRegulatory and accounting requirements may require substantial reductions in reporting proven reserves.\nWe review on a periodic basis the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties under the applicable rules of the various regulatory agencies, including the SEC. Under the full cost method of accounting that we use, the after-tax carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net after-tax cash flows from proved reserves, discounted at 10%. Application of this \"ceiling\" test requires pricing future revenues at the previous 12-month average beginning-of-month price and requires a write down of the carrying value for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded. We may in the future be required to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or unusually volatile. Whether we will be required to take such a charge will depend in part on the prices for crude oil and natural gas during the previous period and the effect of reserve additions or revisions and capital expenditures during such period. If a write down is required, it would result in a current charge to our earnings but would not impact our current cash flow from operating activities.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we currently, and may in the future, enter into derivative arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production, including collars and fixed-price swaps. We have not designated any of our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and record all derivative instruments on our balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized in earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments. Derivative arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nproduction is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contract obligations; or\n\u2022\nthere is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual price received.\nIn addition, some of these types of derivative arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose us to cash margin requirements.\nWe may have difficulty managing future growth and the related demands on our resources and may have difficulty in achieving future growth.\nAlthough we hope to experience growth through acquisitions and development activity, any such growth may place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and administrative resources. Our ability to grow will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to identify and acquire new development or acquisition projects;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop existing properties;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel;\n\u2022\nthe results of our development program and acquisition efforts;\n\u2022\nthe success of our technologies;\n\u2022\nhydrocarbon prices;\n\u2022\ndrilling, completion and equipment prices;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate new properties;\n\u2022\nour access to capital; and\n\u2022\nthe Delhi Field operator's ability to: (i) deliver sufficient quantities of CO2 from its reserves in the Jackson Dome, secure all of the development capital necessary to fund its and our cost interests and (ii) successfully manage technical, operating, environmental, strategic and logistical development and operating risks, among other things.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully grow or manage any such growth.\nOur operations require significant amounts of capital and additional financing may be necessary in order for us to continue our exploitation activities, including meeting potential future drilling obligations.\nOur cash flow from our reserves may not be sufficient to fund our ongoing activities at all times. From time to time, we may require additional financing in order to carry out our oil and gas acquisitions, exploitation and development activities. Certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage may be subject to leases that will expire unless production is established. If our revenues from our reserves decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, it will affect our ability to expend the necessary capital to replace our reserves or to maintain our current production. If our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditure requirements, there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to meet these requirements or available to us on favorable terms.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves, well performance and potential liabilities, as well as uncertainties in forecasting oil and gas prices and future development, production and marketing costs, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult.\nWe periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nrecoverable reserves\n\u2022\nfuture oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials;\n\u2022\ndevelopment and operating costs\n\u2022\npotential for future drilling and production;\n\u2022\nvalidity of the seller's title to properties, which may be less than expected at closing; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily\nobservable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis. Indemnification from the sellers will generally be effective only during the twelve-month period after the closing and subject to certain dollar limitations and minimums. We may not be able to collect on such indemnification because of disputes with the sellers or their inability to pay. Moreover, there is a risk that we could ultimately be liable for unknown obligations related to acquisitions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSignificant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve other risks, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nthe challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of our operations while carrying on our ongoing business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022\nan inability to secure, on acceptable terms, sufficient financing that my be required in connection with expanded operations and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\nthe challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations.\nThe process of integrating assets could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer. In addition, even if we successfully integrate the assets acquired in an acquisition, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we may expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition or realize these benefits within the expected time frame.\nGovernment regulation and liability for environmental matters may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCrude oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, which may be changed from time to time. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of crude oil and natural gas. There are federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment applicable to the development, production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of crude oil and natural gas, by-products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with crude oil and natural gas operations. In addition, we may inherit liability for environmental damages, whether actual or not, caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease or nearby properties. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities. We are also subject to changing and extensive tax laws, the effects of which cannot be predicted. The implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us, such as diminishing the demand for our products through legislative enactment of proposed new penalties, fines and/or taxes on carbon that could have the effect of raising prices to the end user.\nFor example, currently proposed federal legislation, that, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, includes the following:\n\u2022\nTaxes. President Obama\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2016 recommended the elimination of certain key United States federal income tax preferences currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for United States production activities for oil and gas production, and (iv) the extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any such changes or similar changes will be enacted or, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax law could affect certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and production. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows; and\n\u2022\nHydraulic Fracturing. The U.S. Congress, the EPA and various states are currently considering legislation that could adversely affect the use of the hydraulic-fracturing process. Currently, regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements. Any proposed legislation, if adopted, could establish an additional level of regulation, permitting and restrictions at the federal level that could adversely affect the development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources.\nOur insurance may not protect us against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.\nThe crude oil and natural gas business involves numerous operating hazards such as well blowouts, mechanical failures, explosions, uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, hurricanes, flooding, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, which can result in (i) damage to or destruction of wells and/or production facilities, (ii) damage to or destruction of formations, (iii) injury to persons, (iv) loss of life, or (v) damage to property, the environment or natural resources. While we carry general liability, control of well, and operator's extra expense coverage typical in our industry, we are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business. Environmental events similar to that experienced in the Delhi field in June 2013 could defer revenue, increase operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect us.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel, including our executive officers, the loss of any of whom could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our future success is dependent upon Robert S. Herlin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Randall D. Keys, our President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, and Daryl V. Mazzanti, our Senior Vice President of Operations, for sourcing, evaluating and closing deals, capital raising, and oversight of development and operations. Presently, the Company is not a beneficiary of any key man insurance.\nOil field service and materials' prices may increase, and the availability of such services and materials may be inadequate to meet our needs.\nOur business plan to develop or redevelop crude oil and natural gas resources requires third party oilfield service vendors and various material providers, which we do not control. We also rely on third-party carriers for the transportation and distribution of our production. As our production increases, so does our need for such services and materials. Generally, we do not have long-term agreements with our service and materials providers. Accordingly, there is a risk that any of our service providers could discontinue servicing our crude oil and natural gas fields for any reason or we may not be able to source the materials we need. Any delay in locating, establishing relationships, and training our sources could result in production shortages and maintenance problems, with a resulting loss of revenue to us. In addition, if costs for such services and materials increase, it may render certain or all of our projects uneconomic, as compared to the earlier prices we may have assumed when deciding to redevelop newly purchased or existing properties. Further adverse economic outcomes may result from the long lead times often necessary to execute and complete our redevelop plans.\nWe cannot market the crude oil and natural gas that we produce without the assistance of third parties.\nThe marketability of the crude oil and natural gas that we produce depends upon the proximity of our reserves to, and the capacity of, facilities and third-party services, including crude oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines, trucking or terminal facilities, and processing facilities necessary to make the products marketable for end use. The unavailability or lack of capacity of such services and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. A shut-in or delay or discontinuance could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe face strong competition from larger oil and gas companies.\nOur competitors include major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies and numerous independent crude oil and natural gas companies, individuals and drilling and income programs. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than ours. We may not be able to successfully conduct our operations, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. Specifically, these larger competitors may be able to pay more for development projects and productive crude oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, such companies may be able to expend greater resources on hiring contract service providers, obtaining oilfield equipment and acquiring the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in our industry.\nWe are, and in the future may become, involved in legal proceedings related to our Delhi interest or other properties or operations and, as a result, may incur substantial costs in connection with those proceedings.\nIn December 2013 we filed a lawsuit against the operator of the Delhi field alleging that the operator improperly charged the payout account for capital expenditures and costs of capital, failed to adhere to preferential rights to participate in acquisitions within the defined area of mutual interest, breached the promises to assume environmental liabilities and fully indemnify us from such costs, and other breaches. We are seeking declaration of the validity of the 2006 agreements and recovery of damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. The operator subsequently filed counterclaims, including the assertion that we owed it additional revenue interests pursuant to the 2006 agreements and that the transfer of our reversionary working interest from our wholly owned subsidiary to our parent corporation and subsequently to another wholly owned subsidiary breached their preferential right to purchase. We have denied their counterclaims as being without merit and not timely. We may incur significant legal costs in this matter and the outcome is uncertain.\nOwnership of our oil, gas and mineral production depends on good title to our property.\nGood and clear title to our oil, gas and mineral properties is important to our business. Although title reviews will generally be conducted prior to the purchase of most oil, gas and mineral producing properties or the commencement of drilling wells, such reviews do not assure that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise to defeat our claim which could result in a reduction or elimination of the revenue received by us from such properties.\nPoor general economic, business, or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nDuring the last few years, concerns over inflation, energy costs, declining oil and gas prices, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, uncertainties with regard to European sovereign debt, the slowdown in economic growth in large emerging and developing markets, such as China, and other issues have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Concerns about global economic conditions have had a significant adverse impact on domestic and international financial markets and commodity prices. If uncertain or poor economic, business or industry conditions in the United States or abroad remain prolonged, demand for petroleum products could diminish or stagnate, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs, affect our vendors', suppliers' and customers' ability to continue operations, and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nRisks Associated with Our Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nOur common stock is relatively thinly traded and the market price has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. For example, during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, our stock price as traded on the NYSE MKT ranged from $5.68 to $11.19. The variance in our stock price makes it difficult to forecast with any certainty the stock price at which an investor may be able to buy or sell shares of our common stock. The market price for our common stock could be subject to fluctuations as a result of factors that are out of our control, such as:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nnaked short selling of our common stock and stock price manipulation;\n\u2022\nchanges or fluctuations in the commodity prices of crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions and trends in the crude oil and natural gas industry;\n\u2022\nredemption demands on institutional funds that hold our stock; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nOur executive officers, directors and affiliates may be able to control the election of our directors and all other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers and directors, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 3.2 million shares, or approximately 10% of our beneficial common stock base. JVL Advisors LLC controls approximately 4.9 million shares or approximately 15% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these holders could exercise significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval (including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets). This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our company or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe market for our common stock is limited and may not provide adequate liquidity.\nOur common stock is relatively thinly traded on the NYSE MKT. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, the actual daily trading volume in our common stock ranged from 20,800 shares of common stock to a high of 759,200 shares of common stock traded. On most days, this trading volume means that there is relatively limited liquidity in our shares of common stock. Selling our shares is more difficult because smaller quantities of shares are bought and sold and news media coverage about us is limited. These factors result in a limited trading market for our common stock and therefore holders of our stock may be unable to sell shares purchased, should they desire to do so.\nIf securities or industry analyst do not publish research reports about our business, or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nSmall, relatively unknown companies can achieve visibility in the trading market through research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish. To our knowledge there are three independent analysts that cover our company. The limited number of published reports by independent securities analysts could limit the interest in our common stock and negatively affect our stock price. We do not have any control over the research and reports these analysts publish or whether they will be published at all. If any analyst who does cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price could decline. If any analyst ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe issuance of additional common stock and preferred stock could dilute existing stockholders.\nWe currently have in place a registration statement which allows the Company to publicly issue up to $500 million of additional securities, including debt, common stock, preferred stock, and warrants. At any time we may make private offerings of our securities. The shelf registration is intended to provide greater flexibility to the company in financing growth or changing our capital structure. We are authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock. To the extent of such authorization, our board of directors has the ability, without seeking stockholder approval, to issue additional shares of common stock in the future for such consideration as our board may consider sufficient. The issuance of additional common stock in the future would reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of the common stock now outstanding. We are also authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, the rights and preferences of which may be designated in series by our board of directors, of which, at least 317,319 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding as of September 1, 2015. Such designation of new series of preferred stock may be made without stockholder approval, and could create additional securities which would have dividend and liquidation preferences over the common stock now outstanding. Preferred stockholders could adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock by:\n\u2022\nexercising voting, redemption and conversion rights to the detriment of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nreceiving preferences over the holders of common stock regarding our surplus funds in the event of our dissolution, liquidation or the payment of dividends to Preferred stockholders;\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company; and\n\u2022\ndiscouraging bids for our common stock.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock is thinly traded and has no stated maturity date.\nThe shares of Series A Preferred Stock were listed for trading on the NYSE MKT under the symbol \"EPM.PR.A\" on July 5, 2011 and are thinly traded on the NYSE MKT. Since the securities have no stated maturity date, investors seeking liquidity will be limited to selling their shares in the secondary market. An active trading market for the shares may not develop or, even if it develops, may not last, in which case the trading price of the shares could be adversely affected and your ability to transfer your shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be limited. We have the right to redeem all shares of Series A Preferred Stock at face value plus accrued dividends at any time.\nThe market value of our Series A Preferred Stock could be adversely affected by various factors.\nThe trading price of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock may depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nmarket liquidity;\n\u2022\nprevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\noptional redemption by us;\n\u2022\nthe market for similar securities;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nour financial condition, performance and prospects.\nFor example, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock to decrease.\nWe could be prevented from paying dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock.\nAlthough dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are cumulative and arrearages will accrue until paid, preferred stockholders will only receive cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock if we have funds legally available for the payment of dividends and such payment is not restricted or prohibited by law, the terms of any senior shares or any documents governing our indebtedness. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock when payable. In addition, existing or future debt, credit facility arrangements, contractual covenants or arrangements we enter into may restrict or prevent future dividend payments. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that we will be able to pay any cash dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock.\nFurthermore, in some circumstances, we may pay dividends in stock rather than cash, and our stock price may be depressed at such time.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has not been rated and will be subordinated to all of our existing and future debt.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has not been rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization. In addition, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, the Series A Preferred Stock will be subordinated to any existing and future debt and all future capital stock designated as senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future to finance potential acquisitions or the development of new properties and the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock do not require us to obtain the approval of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock prior to incurring additional indebtedness. As a result, our existing and future indebtedness may be subject to restrictive covenants or other provisions that may prevent or otherwise limit our ability to make dividend or liquidation payments on our Series A Preferred Stock. Upon our liquidation, our obligations to our creditors would rank senior to our Series A Preferred Stock and would be required to be paid before any payments could be made to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock.\nWe could be prevented from continuing to pay dividends on our Common Stock.\nOur board of directors declared cash dividends on our common stock for the first time in December 2013 and we have declared and paid quarterly cash dividends since that time. However, there is no certainty that dividends will be declared by the board of directors in the future. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be dependent upon the amount of funds legally available, our earnings, if any, our financial condition and business plan, restrictions contained in our Series A Preferred Stock and any debt instruments, contractual covenants or arrangements we may enter into, our anticipated capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors may think are relevant. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock.", "PERMNO": 83411, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "EPM"}
