Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results would likely suffer.\nChanges in the funding priorities of the U.S. federal government, and changes in the way the U.S. federal government contracts with businesses, may materially and adversely affect our revenue and earnings.\nSince the U.S. federal government is our largest customer, both directly and with us as a subcontractor, changes in the funding priorities of the U.S. federal government may materially and adversely affect us if funding is cut or shifted away from the information technology services that we are equipped to provide. Additionally, changes in the way the government awards contracts may create a disadvantage for us to compete in certain markets.\nInformation Analysis Incorporated 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTemporary or extended budget-related shutdowns of parts of the U.S. federal government may materially and adversely affect our revenue and earnings.\nSince the U.S. federal government is our largest customer, both directly and with us as a subcontractor, budget impasses that lead to temporary or extended shutdowns of agencies of the U.S. federal government with which we contract or for which we provide services may adversely affect cash flow and earnings as we carry key personnel during periods in which they are unable to perform work which can be invoiced to the customers.\nU.S. federal government contracts are generally subject to terms more favorable to the customer than commercial contracts.\nU.S. federal government contracts generally contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the federal government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions permitting the federal government to:\n\u25a0\nterminate our existing contracts;\n\u25a0\nreduce potential future income from our existing contracts;\n\u25a0\nmodify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts;\n\u25a0\nsuspend or permanently prohibit us from doing business with the federal government or with any specific government agency;\n\u25a0\nimpose fines and penalties;\n\u25a0\nsubject the award of some contracts to protest or challenge by competitors, which may require the contracting federal agency or department to suspend our performance pending the outcome of the protest or challenge and which may also require the government to solicit new proposals for the contract or result in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract;\n\u25a0\nsuspend work under existing multiple year contracts and related task orders if the necessary funds are not appropriated by Congress;\n\u25a0\ndecline to exercise an option to extend an existing multiple year contract; and\n\u25a0\nclaim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us.\nThe U.S. federal government may terminate a contract either \u201cfor convenience\u201d (for instance, due to a change in its perceived needs or its desire to consolidate work under another contract) or if a default occurs by failing to perform under the contract. If the federal government terminates a contract for convenience, we generally would be entitled to recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. If the federal government terminates a contract based upon a default, we generally would be denied any recovery for undelivered work, and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the federal government in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source and other damages as authorized by law.\nThe failure to generate a sufficient level of professional fees will cause us to sustain losses.\nAlthough software sales constitute a significant part of our overall revenue, the gross profit we derive from such sales is very modest, generally less than three percent. Consequently, we are reliant on professional fee revenue to maintain and operate our business. Our number of professional fee engagements are limited and we have relied upon several key engagements to provide us with the level of revenue we require to breakeven or gain a modest degree of profitability. Any loss of a key contract will have a detrimental effect on the Company.\nThe opportunities among our existing customers for forms modernization is nearing maturity.\nOver the last several years, we have modernized nearly all of the forms for which modernization was needed to meet compliance standards within agencies that have been our key electronic forms customers. While we continue to assist these customers with incremental changes on their internal and external forms, we must position ourselves to find forms business within some new agencies. While we do not anticipate a material effect on our overall results of operations, we may experience a material decline in revenue.\nInformation Analysis Incorporated 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nFailure to keep pace with a changing technological environment could negatively impact our business.\nThe IT industry in general, and the market for our application software offerings and services, is characterized by rapidly changing technology, frequent new technology introductions, and significant competition. In order to keep pace with this rapidly changing market environment, we must continually develop and incorporate into our services new technological advances and features desired by the marketplace at acceptable prices. If we are unsuccessful in identifying, developing and marketing our services and technology or adapting our business to rapid technological change, it will have a material negative impact on our results of operations.\nGaining entry into new markets for services offerings such as cybersecurity, cloud services, and artificial intelligence may prove to be unsuccessful.\nAlthough we currently intend to expand into cybersecurity, cloud services, and the artificial intelligence markets, we do not have significant prior experience in these markets. There are no assurances that we will be successful in developing the required expertise or succeeding in these new markets.\nInvestments we are making in developing infrastructure and gaining expertise in new services offerings such as cybersecurity, cloud services, and artificial intelligence may take time to recover.\nThe successful development and commercialization of new services and technology involves many risks, including the identification of new opportunities, timely completion of the development process, the control and recovery of development and production costs and acceptance by customers of our products and services. If we are unsuccessful in developing and marketing our new services and technology, it is likely to have a material negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to intense competition from other companies engaged in software development, cloud services, and other computer-related services.\nThe market for our products and services is competitive, rapidly evolving, and can be affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Some of these companies have longer operating histories, greater financial, marketing and other resources, greater name recognition in other markets and a larger base of customers than IAI. In addition, some companies have well-established relationships with our current and prospective customers. As a result, these competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can. Should we not be able to maintain our competitive advantages in light of these factors, it could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate the cost of services and the timeline for completion of contracts, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur commercial and federal government contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the services. To generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. If we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected.\nContracts on which we utilize subcontractors or suppliers may be adversely affected if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform required obligations under the contract.\nWe frequently utilize subcontract labor on contracts where we lack specific functional expertise or where the subcontractor has brought the opportunity to us. If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform as specified, it may adversely affect our contracts and subject us to loss of the contracts, unintended expenses, and/or the inability to secure future contracts due to our nonperformance.\nOur federal government contracts typically have terms of one or more base years and one or more option years. Federal governmental agencies generally have the right not to exercise options to extend a contract. A decision to terminate or not to exercise options to extend our existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation Analysis Incorporated 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nWe are dependent on key personnel to maintain our profitability and grow our business.\nOur future success depends, to a significant extent, on the continued services of our key personnel. A loss of certain key personnel, both managerial and technical, would most likely have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel throughout the industry is significant and we may be unable to retain our current personnel or attract, integrate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. If we do not succeed in retaining our current personnel or in attracting and motivating new personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utilize qualified personnel.\nThe success of our business and our ability to operate profitably is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utilize qualified personnel, including personnel with expertise in very old computing languages, for which there is a limited supply, and personnel with expertise in cutting-edge immature technologies. We also must be able to hire and retain corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost. The market for these and other personnel is competitive. From time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise, and in the timeframe, demanded by our clients, or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain a sufficient amount of qualified personnel. Furthermore, some of our personnel may be required to obtain or hold government-granted clearances to obtain government projects. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and management personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects.\nWe may acquire other businesses, products or technologies; if we do, we may be unable to integrate them with our business effectively or at all, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we find appropriate opportunities and have adequate funding, we may acquire other businesses, product lines or technologies. However, if we acquire a business, product line or technology, the process of integration may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant attention of our management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. Further, the acquisition of a business may result in the assumption of unknown liabilities or create risks with respect to our existing relationships with suppliers and customers. If we make acquisitions, we may issue shares of stock that dilute other stockholders, expend cash, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we may not be able to execute the acquisition of other businesses.\nWe may require additional capital to fund operations, capital expenditures and or the acquisition of other businesses. We may finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, or corporate collaborations. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our acquisition opportunities. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time.\nInformation Analysis Incorporated 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOur software sales are subject to increasing price competition, fluctuation in demand, and our relationships with third-party software and software maintenance suppliers.\nFederal government customers are increasingly utilizing systems to accept software bids that make it easier for a larger number of sellers to participate in the bid process, which puts downward pressure on prices. At the same time, we obtain software licenses and related software maintenance contracts for resale from third-party suppliers. Increases in costs from these suppliers may affect our ability to bid winning prices to potential customers, which could have a material effect on software sales revenue. Also, any delay in our suppliers\u2019 fulfillment of our orders could impair our ability to deliver products and maintenance to customers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.\nWe are dependent on information technology, and disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet and cloud services, many of which are managed by third parties, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information of financial, marketing, legal and regulatory nature to manage our business processes and activities. Although we have implemented enhanced controls around our information technology systems, these systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product and services sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, or our operations may be disrupted, exposing us to performance failures with customers. In addition, cybersecurity threats, such as computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. There can be no assurance that our security controls and safeguard measures taken to improve our cybersecurity protection will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. Potential consequences of a cybersecurity attack include disruption to systems, corruption of data, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, reputational damage, and litigation with third parties. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities related to a cybersecurity attack.\nHealth epidemics, pandemics, and other natural disasters and national emergencies may have material adverse effects on our business.\nWe face various risks related to widespread health emergencies and natural disasters, including the global outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus). If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will likely be impacted. Effects experienced by our customers may affect the quantity of billable work we can perform, and effects experienced by our suppliers may impact our ability to deliver on our sales contracts. Opportunities to seek new business may be delayed indefinitely.\nWe are working with our employees, customers, suppliers, and community to monitor and assess the developing situation, and will continue to work to mitigate the effects on all parties. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition is uncertain.\nFluctuations in our results of operations from period to period may cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nOur financial results vary from quarter to quarter based on certain factors such as the timing of significant orders, contract funding approvals and contract completions, some of which are beyond our control. As a consequence, our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results may fluctuate from period to period, and period comparisons may therefore not be meaningful. Such fluctuations in the future could contribute to corresponding fluctuations in our stock price and in certain cases cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\nInformation Analysis Incorporated 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nThe exercise of outstanding options to purchase our common stock could substantially dilute shareholders\u2019 investments.\nUnder the terms of outstanding options to acquire our common stock issued to employees and others, the holders thereof are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock that, upon the exercise of such options, could result in dilution in the interests of our other shareholders.\nThere is a limited public market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is presently quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol \u201cIAIC\u201d, and traded through broker-dealers. Because our stock trades on OTCQB rather than on a national securities exchange, a shareholder may find it difficult to either dispose of or obtain quotations as to the price of our common stock. There has historically been a low trading volume of our shares which may have an adverse impact on a shareholder\u2019s ability to execute transactions of our shares.\nThe extent to which we can reach and encourage the participation of enough of our investors to secure minimum thresholds for shareholder approval for matters subject to shareholder approval is uncertain.\nGiven the limited amount trading our shares have experienced over the last several years, we have relied on relationships with investors owning material amounts of shares to reach minimum thresholds needed for shareholder approval of matters that were subject to a shareholder vote. The voting control over some of those shares have changed, and there is some question as to whether we can garner enough votes to decide shareholder matters by simple proxy solicitation. We may need to engage a third-party proxy solicitor if we obtain too little response to a proxy solicitation.", "PERMNO": 85377, "SIC": 7371, "TIC": "IAIC"}
