If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings and the book values of these assets would decrease.\nAs a result of the branch acquisition from Sterling in FY 2013, we recorded goodwill in the amount of $6.89 million in the second quarter of 2013. Final valuation adjustments were recorded in the second quarter of 2014 for $144,000 and impacted goodwill. The final goodwill recorded related to the acquisition was $7.03 million. We are required to test our goodwill for impairment on a periodic basis. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common shares, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. It is possible that future impairment testing could result in a partial or full impairment of the value of our goodwill. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the structure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (\u201cGSEs\u201d) and the relationship among the GSEs, the federal government and the private markets, or the conversion of the current conservatorship of the GSEs into receivership, could result in significant changes to our securities portfolio.\nThe GSEs are currently in conservatorship, with their primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, acting as conservator. We cannot predict if, when or how the conservatorships will end, or any associated changes to the GSEs\u2019 business structure that could result. There are several proposed approaches, including possible legislative changes in discussion in both the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee which, if enacted, could change the nature of government participation in the private mortgage market or alternatively the structure of the GSEs, the relationship among the GSEs, the government and the private markets, including the trading markets for agency conforming mortgage loans and markets for mortgage-related securities in which we participate. We cannot predict the prospects for the enactment, timing or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of any of these approaches. Accordingly, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the future of the GSEs, including whether they will continue to exist in their current form. GSE reform, if enacted, could result in a significant change and adversely impact our business operations, particularly as to our residential mortgage lending activities.\nWe cannot accurately predict the effect of the recent economic downturn on our future results of operations or market price of our stock.\nThe national economy and the financial services sector, while improving somewhat, continue to face challenges. We cannot accurately predict whether the economic downturn, which adversely impacted the markets we serve, will continue to abate or whether further downturns may occur. Any renewed deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in our markets would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and could also cause the market price of our stock to decline. A fragile recovery or another recession could continue to present risks for some time for the financial services industry and our company.\nIf the allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nOur customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral, if any, securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. We may experience significant loan losses, which may have a material adverse effect on operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. If the assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income.\nOur emphasis on the origination of consumer, commercial real estate and commercial business loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating the allowance for loan losses. As we continue to increase the amount of such loans, additional or increased provisions for loan losses may be necessary and would decrease earnings.\nBank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase to the provision for loan losses or further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe could record future losses on our securities portfolio.\nA number of factors or combinations of factors could require us to conclude in one or more future reporting periods that an unrealized loss exists with respect to our investment securities portfolio that constitutes an impairment that is other than temporary, which could result in material losses to us. These factors include, but are not limited to, continued failure by the issuer to make scheduled interest payments, an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss on a particular security, an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an improvement in value or changes in market conditions and/or industry or issuer specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery in value. In addition, the fair values of securities could decline if the overall economy and the financial condition of some of the issuers deteriorates and there is limited liquidity for these securities.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies are essential to understanding our financial results and condition. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations and financial condition. We could also be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts.\nA prolonged economic downturn, especially one affecting our geographic market areas, will adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe United States and many industrial nations are experiencing adverse economic conditions and slow recovery. Loan portfolio quality has improved at many institutions, reflecting in part, the improving U.S. economy and rising employment. In addition, the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages appear to have stabilized but may continue to decline. The continuing stagnation in the real estate market also has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of new housing and increased delinquencies in construction, residential and commercial mortgage loans. Financial institution stock prices have declined substantially, and it is significantly more difficult for financial institutions to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets.\nContinued negative developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the market for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Moreover, continued volatility or declines in the stock market in general, or stock values of financial institutions and their holding companies, could adversely affect our stock performance.\nBecause we have increased our commercial real estate and commercial business loan originations, our credit risk has increased and continued downturns in the local real estate market or economy could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe intend to continue our recent emphasis on originating commercial real estate and commercial business loans. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally have more risk than the residential real estate (1-4 family) loans we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate and commercial business loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of nonperforming loans. As our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase.\nDeclines in home values could decrease our loan originations and increase delinquencies and defaults.\nDeclines in home values in our markets could adversely impact results from operations. Like all financial institutions, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn, and in particular, a significant decline in home values would likely lead to a decrease in new home equity loan originations and increased delinquencies and defaults in both the consumer home equity loan and residential real estate loan portfolios and result in increased losses in these portfolios. Declines in the average sale prices of homes in our primary markets could lead to higher loan losses.\nWe depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees.\nOur success depends upon the continued employment of certain members of our senior management team. We also depend upon the continued employment of the individuals that manage several of our key functional areas. The departure of any member of our senior management team may adversely affect our operations.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits, borrowings and trust preferred securities. Because our interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. Also, increases in interest rates may extend the life of fixed rate assets, which would restrict our ability to reinvest in higher yielding alternatives, and may result in customers withdrawing certificates of deposit early so long as the early withdrawal penalty is less than the interest they could receive as a result of the higher interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the current fair value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates.\nStrong competition may limit growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors (whether regional or national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our ability to successfully compete in our market areas.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the Montana Division of Banking and Financial Institutions. The federal banking laws and regulations govern the activities in which we may engage, and are primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund at the FDIC. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank\u2019s operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of a bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material impact on our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change. Any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.\nFinancial reform legislation enacted by Congress will, among other things, tighten capital standards, create a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.\nCongress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2010. This new law has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators, which in the case of the Bank is the FRB.\nIt is difficult to predict at this time what impact the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing rules will have on community banks like the Bank. However, it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense.\nIf our investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines becomes impaired, our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity could decrease.\nWe are required to own common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (\u2018FHLB\u201d) to qualify for membership in the FHLB System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the FHLB\u2019s advance program. The aggregate cost of our FHLB common stock as of December 31, 2015 was $3.40 million. FHLB common stock is not a marketable security and can only be redeemed by the FHLB.\nFHLB\u2019s may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could materially lower their regulatory capital. In an extreme situation, it is possible that the capitalization of a FHLB, including the FHLB of Des Moines, could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero. Consequently, we believe that there is a risk that our investment in FHLB of Des Moines common stock could be deemed impaired at some time in the future, and if this occurs, it would cause our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity to decrease by the amount of the impairment charge.\nFuture legislative or regulatory actions responding to perceived financial and market problems could impair our ability to foreclose on collateral.\nThere have been proposals made by members of Congress and others that would reduce the amount distressed borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution\u2019s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral. Were proposals such as these, or other proposals limiting our rights as a creditor, to be adopted, we could experience increased credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.", "PERMNO": 93368, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "EBMT"}
