{"cik": "275053", "company": "NATURES SUNSHINE PRODUCTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks in evaluating us and our business. The risks described below are the risks that we currently believe are material to our business. However, additional risks not presently known to us, or risks that we currently believe are not material, may also impair our business operations. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this report, including the information set forth in \u201cBusiness\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d as well as in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the following risks. If we are adversely affected by such risks, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nLaws and regulations regarding direct selling may prohibit or restrict our ability to sell our products in some markets or require us to make changes to our business model in some markets.\nDirect selling companies are subject to laws and regulations by various government agencies throughout the world. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive practices and to ensure that sales are made to consumers of the products, and that compensation is based primarily upon bone fide sale of products to consumers and not primarily upon the recruitment of other persons as participants in the compensation program. Regulations in some countries in which we operate, including South Korea and China, limit the amount of compensation we can pay to our independent distributors. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Violations could result from misconduct by an independent distributor, ambiguity in statutes, changes or new laws and regulations affecting our business and court-related decisions.\nThe FTC in the United States, and similar government agencies in foreign jurisdictions, periodically investigate and bring enforcement actions against direct selling companies based on alleged pyramid selling activity and/or false and misleading claims made by the direct selling company or its independent distributors. Direct selling companies that have been the subject of an FTC enforcement action have generally been required to make significant changes to their business model and pay significant monetary fines. Being the target of an investigation or enforcement action by the FTC in the United States, or a similar government agency in a foreign jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur products, business practices and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulations and could be subject to additional laws and regulations.\nThe formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sales of each of our major product groups are subject to regulation by numerous domestic and foreign governmental agencies and authorities. In the U.S., these governmental agencies and authorities include the FDA, the FTC, the CPSC, the EPA, the USDA and state regulatory agencies. Generally, each international market in which we operate has regulatory agencies similar to the regulatory agencies in the U.S. In addition, each State in the United States has an attorney general who is responsible for enforcing the laws of that State. Some states\u2019 Attorneys General have, from time to time, demonstrated a focus on the manufacture and sale of various dietary supplements. As a result of such focus, a states\u2019 Attorneys General could seek to take actions against us or other industry participants or amend applicable regulations in their State, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition by causing us to incur additional costs to comply or cease selling one or more of our\nproducts. As the primary manufacturer of our own products, we are subject to FDA regulations on Good Manufacturing Practices (\"GMP\"), which require us to maintain good manufacturing processes, including ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping.\nIngredient identification requirements, which require us to confirm the levels, identity and potency of ingredients listed on our product labels within a narrow range, are particularly burdensome and difficult for us with respect to our product formulations, which contain many different ingredients. Compliance with these regulations has increased and may further increase the cost of manufacturing our products. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if a regulatory authority makes a determination that we are not in compliance with ingredient identification requirements. A finding of noncompliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties or actions impacting our ability to continue selling certain products. Failure to comply with ingredient identification requirements could also lead to private class action lawsuits which would be costly, disruptive and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the future, we may be subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA or other federal, state, local or foreign regulatory authorities, the repeal or amendment of laws or regulations which we consider favorable and/or more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. Such changes could, among other things, require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, cause us to recall or discontinue certain of our products, impose additional record-keeping requirements, expand documentation of the properties of certain products and expand or alter labeling and/or scientific substantiation requirements. Any or all such requirements could increase our costs of operating the business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe FTC and states' attorney general have in the past instituted enforcement actions against dietary supplement and food companies and against manufacturers of weight loss products generally for false and misleading advertising of some of their products. The FTC and states' attorney general from time to time have initiated investigations and enforcement actions against direct selling companies the FTC or states' attorney general alleged operated a pyramid scheme. Although the FTC and states' attorney general exercise a substantial degree of subjectivity in determining whether a company is operating a pyramid scheme, the FTC and states' attorney general consider whether the compensation received by our independent distributors is based primarily on recruitment of other persons as participants in the compensation program and not on bona fide sales of products to consumers. The FTC and states' attorney general have also initiated investigations and enforcement actions as a result of misleading representations relating to the earnings potential of independent distributors within a company\u2019s compensation plan. Additionally, in recent years, private watchdog groups have increased their attention on companies in the dietary supplement and direct selling industries with allegations of false or misleading product and earnings claims. Such private watchdog groups actively monitor dietary supplement and direct selling companies and their independent distributors with the goal of encouraging the FTC and/or states' attorney general to take enforcement action against practices they believe are misleading or illegal. We cannot be sure that the FTC or states' attorney general, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question our advertising claims, or advertising claims made by our independent distributors, in the future. Additionally, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have filed class action lawsuits against some of our competitors, which are often expensive to defend against. An enforcement action brought by a government agency, like the FTC in the United States, or a class action lawsuit, could adversely affect our reputation and potentially result in significant penalties and costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur direct selling system could be challenged in one or more countries in which we do business.\nLegal and regulatory requirements concerning the direct selling industry generally do not include \"bright line\" rules and are inherently fact-based and subject to interpretation. As a result, regulators and courts often have discretion in their application of these laws and regulations. The enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by government agencies or courts can change from time to time. We periodically become aware of investigations and enforcement actions against other companies in the direct selling industry. An adverse ruling in an investigation or enforcement action involving a direct selling company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if direct selling laws or anti-pyramid laws are interpreted more narrowly or in a manner that results in significant burdens or restrictions on direct selling companies.\nWe could also be subject to challenges by private parties in civil actions, including class action cases brought by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers. From time to time, we become aware of civil class actions brought against our competitors in the United States, which have and may in the future result in adverse judgments and significant settlements. A civil class action lawsuit brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if it results in an adverse judgment or a significant settlement.\nGovernment regulations in China are particularly demanding and the Chinese regulatory authorities exercise broad discretion in interpreting and apply regulations. As a result, the model we created specifically for China may not continue to be deemed compliant by national or local Chinese regulatory authorities if applicable regulations, or their interpretations, evolve in a manner that is adverse to us and our business model in China. In December 2018, the Chinese government took significant action against a Chinese direct selling company that it alleged was engaged in illegal activity, including false and misleading product and income related claims and other illegal pyramid activities. In January 2019, the Chinese government announced that it was initiating a period of heightened monitoring and enforcement of the dietary supplement and direct selling industries. During such period, additional dietary supplement and direct selling companies have been the subject of investigation and enforcement actions by the Chinese government. There can be no guarantee that the Chinese government\u2019s on-going period of heightened monitoring and enforcement will not have a material adverse impact on our result of operations and financial condition or that current or future interpretation and application of the existing and new regulations will not adversely impact our business in China, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\").\nWe are subject to anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business as well as requiring companies and their intermediaries to maintain accurate books and records. In recent years there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") and the SEC relating to business operations within certain countries in which we operate, including China. For example, in recent years, U.S. based direct selling companies with operations in China have been the subject of investigations and enforcement actions, or in some cases have initiated their own internal investigation, relating to alleged violations of the FCPA.\nOur policies mandate compliance with anti-bribery laws by our employees and agents, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. However, we may be liable for actions of our employees and agents, even if such actions are inconsistent with our policies. Being subject to an investigation by the DOJ or the SEC for an alleged violation of the FCPA could cause us to incur significant expenses and distractions that could adversely affect our business. Violations of the FCPA, or a similar anti-bribery law, may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain independent distributors.\nAs a direct selling company, our revenue depends primarily on the number and productivity of our independent distributors. We, like most direct selling companies, experience high levels of turnover among our independent distributors from year to year, who may terminate their service at any time. Generally, we need to increase the productivity of our independent distributors and/or retain existing independent distributors and attract additional independent distributors to maintain and/or increase future sales.\nMany factors may affect our ability to attract and retain independent distributors, including:\n\u2022\npublicity regarding us, our products, our distribution channels or our competitors;\n\u2022\non-going motivation of our independent distributors;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s perceptions about the value and efficacy of our products;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s perceptions and acceptance of direct selling;\n\u2022\ngeneral and economic business conditions;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations;\n\u2022\nour compensation arrangements, including any changes thereto, training and support for our independent distributors; and\n\u2022\ncompetition in attracting and retaining independent distributors.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if our independent distributors are unable to maintain their current levels of productivity and/or if we are unable to retain existing independent distributors and attract additional independent distributors in sufficient numbers to sustain future growth or to maintain present sales levels.\nThe loss of key independent distributors who have a significant sales networks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant amount of our net sales, in some of our markets, is dependent on a few independent distributors and their extensive sales networks. The loss or inactivity of one of these independent distributors who, together with their extensive sales network, generate a significant amount of our net sales could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur expansion in China is subject to risks associated with operating a joint venture.\nOn August 25, 2014, we completed a transaction with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (\u201cFosun Pharma\u201d), which created a joint venture owned 80 percent by us and 20 percent by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fosun Pharma. Effective operation of the joint venture depends on good relations between us and Fosun Pharma, active synergies between the two companies and positive legal and regulatory recognition of the joint venture. Any disruption in relations, inability to work efficiently or disadvantageous treatment of the joint venture by the Chinese or other authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDifficulties in registering our products for sale in Mainland China could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur registration of our products for sale in China is extremely time intensive. The requirements for obtaining product registrations and/or licenses involve extended periods of time that may delay us from offering products for sale or prevent us from launching new product initiatives in China on the same timelines as other markets around the world. For example, products marketed in China as \u201chealth foods\u201d or for which certain claims are used are subject to \u201cblue cap\u201d or \u201cblue hat\u201d registrations, which involve extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by governmental authorities. This registration process can take anywhere from 18 months to 3 years, but may be substantially longer. We currently market both \u201chealth foods\u201d and \u201cgeneral foods\u201d in China. There is risk associated with the common practice in China of marketing a product as a \u201cgeneral food\u201d while seeking \u201chealth food\u201d classification. If government officials feel the categorization of products is inconsistent with product claims, ingredients or function, this could end or limit our ability to market such products in China and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCybersecurity risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of data could expose us to data loss, litigation and liability, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe collect and retain large volumes of data from employees and independent distributors, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, for business purposes, including transactional and promotional purposes. Our various information technology systems enter, process, summarize and report such data. The integrity and protection of this data is critical to our business. We are subject to significant security and privacy regulations, as well as requirements imposed by the credit card industry.\nSimilarly, a failure to adhere to the payment card industry\u2019s data security standards could cause us to incur penalties from payment card associations, termination of our ability to accept credit or debit card payments, litigation and adverse publicity, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMaintaining compliance with these evolving regulations and requirements could be difficult and may increase costs. In addition, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss or fraudulent or unlawful use of company, employee, distributor or guest data which could adversely affect our reputation, disrupt our operations, or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Although we take measures to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of our data systems, we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees and types on a regular basis. Our infrastructure may be vulnerable to these attacks, and in some cases it could take time to discover them. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error or malfeasance, system errors or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse or loss of sensitive information and lead to significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory inquiries or investigations, loss of confidence by our sales force, disruption of our operations and damage to our reputation. These risks are heightened as we work with third-party partners and as our sales force uses social media, as the partners and social media platforms could be vulnerable to the same types of breaches.\nThe storage, processing, and use of data, some of which contain personal information, are subject to complex and evolving privacy and data protection laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nSome data we store, process, and use, contains personal information, which subjects us to a variety of privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content, protection of minors, and consumer protection laws and regulations in the United States and other countries. These laws and regulations are evolving in both the United States and in other countries. Such laws and regulations may impose significant fines or penalties and can be particularly restrictive. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and could result in investigations, claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations and declines in growth, retention or engagement, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile several proposals and discussions are before the United States federal government, a number of states have enacted laws or are considering the enactment of laws governing the release of credit card or other personal information received from consumers. For example, in June 2018, California enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, that will, among other things, require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, when it goes into effect on January 1, 2020. There is debate around the CCPA and amendments are possible before its effective date. Additionally, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into effect on May 25, 2018, establishes requirements applicable to the processing of personal data, affords new data protection rights to individuals, and imposes penalties for serious data breaches, including fines of up to 4% of our annual revenue. Individuals also have a right to compensation under GDPR for financial or non-financial losses. GDPR has imposed additional responsibility and liability in relation to our processing of personal data in the EU. GDPR has also required us to change our various policies and procedures in the EU and, if we are not compliant, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Another example is China\u2019s new cybersecurity law. Foreign governments also may attempt to apply such laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities.\nWe cannot assure you that the privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity relating to the privacy and security of personal information. Whether and how existing domestic and international privacy and consumer protection laws apply is still uncertain and may take years to resolve. If privacy laws and regulations are drafted or interpreted broadly, they could be deemed to apply to the technology we use and could restrict our information collection methods or decrease the utility of information we would be permitted to store, process or use. The costs of compliance with these and other laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our products, or increase the costs of doing so, and may affect our ability to invest in or develop products. In addition, a determination by a court or government agency that any of our practices, or those of our distributors, do not meet these standards could result in liability or adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSystem failures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLike many companies, our business is highly dependent upon our information technology infrastructure (websites, accounting and manufacturing applications, and product and customer information databases) to manage effectively and efficiently our operations, including order entry, customer billing, accurate tracking of purchases and volume incentives and managing accounting, finance and manufacturing operations. The occurrence of a natural disaster, security breach or other unanticipated problem could result in interruptions in our day-to-day operations that could adversely affect our business. A long-term failure or impairment of any of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, in April 2017, we began our initial deployment of an Oracle ERP software. The implementation of the Oracle ERP system negatively impacted our net sales and profitability during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily by causing wait times for calls into our call center to be longer than usual and by causing difficulties within our on-line product ordering system.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nIn 2018, we recognized approximately 63.4 percent of our net sales in markets outside the United States, the majority of which were recognized in each market\u2019s respective local currency. We purchase inventory from foreign markets and the United States, primarily in U.S. dollars. In preparing our financial statements, we translate net sales and expenses in foreign countries from their local currencies into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. Because a majority of our sales are in foreign countries, exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant effect on net sales and earnings. Our reported earnings have in the past been, and are likely to continue to be, significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, with net sales and earnings generally increasing with a weaker U.S. dollar and decreasing with a strengthening U.S. dollar.\nWe could incur obligations resulting from the activities of our independent distributors.\nWe sell our products worldwide to a sales force of independent distributors who use the products themselves or resell them to customers. Independent distributors are not employees and operate their own business separate and apart from us. We may not be able to control aspects of their activities that may impact our business. If local laws and regulations, or the interpretation of locals laws and regulations, change and require us to treat our independent distributors as employees, or if our independent distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, we may be held responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees, including employment related taxes and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our independent distributors also operate in jurisdictions where local legislation and governmental agencies require us to collect and remit taxes such as sales tax or value-added taxes. In addition, there is the possibility that some jurisdictions could seek to hold us responsible for false product or earnings potential related claims due to the actions of an independent distributor. If we were found to be responsible for any of these issues related to our independent distributors, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our independent distributors fail to comply with advertising laws, it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe advertisement of our products is subject to extensive regulations in most of the markets in which we do business, including the United States. Our independent distributors may fail to comply with such regulations governing the advertising of our products or business opportunity. In the U.S., our products are sold principally as dietary supplements and cosmetics and are subject to rigorous FDA regulations limiting the types of therapeutic claims that can be made relating to the products. The treatment or cure of disease, for example, is not a permitted claim for our products. In the U.S., the FTC and states' attorney generals are primarily responsible for providing consumer protection by, among other things, investigating and initiating enforcement actions against business practices it deems deceptive or fraudulent. The FTC and states' attorney general have in recent years investigated and initiated enforcement actions against direct selling companies for misleading representations relating to the earnings potential of an independent distributor within a company's compensation plan. In recent years, private watchdog groups have increased their scrutiny of companies in the dietary supplement and direct selling industries with allegations of false or misleading product and earnings claims. Such private watchdog groups actively monitor companies and their independent distributors with the goal of encouraging the FTC or one or more states' attorney general to take enforcement action against practices they believe are misleading or illegal. We cannot ensure that all marketing materials used by our independent distributors comply with applicable regulations, including bans on false and misleading product and earnings potential related claims. If our independent distributors fail to comply with these restrictions, then we could both be subjected to claims of false advertising, misrepresentation, significant financial penalties, costly mandatory product recalls and relabeling requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes to our independent distributor compensation plans.\nWe modify components of our compensation plans from time to time to keep them competitive and attractive to existing and potential independent distributors, to address changing market dynamics, to provide incentives to our independent distributors that we believe will help grow our business, to conform to local regulations and to address other business related considerations. It is difficult to predict how such changes will be viewed by our independent distributors and whether such changes will achieve their desired results. Such changes could result in unintended or unforeseen negative economic and non-economic consequences to our business, such as higher than anticipated costs or difficulty in attracting and retaining independent distributors, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nGeopolitical issues, conflicts and other global events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the United States, our business is subject to global political issues and conflicts. Such political issues and conflicts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if they escalate in areas in which we do business. In addition, changes in and adverse actions by governments in foreign markets in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDifficult economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nConsumer spending habits, including spending for our products, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, fuel prices, salaries and wages, the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. Economic slowdowns in the markets in which we do business may adversely affect consumer spending habits and demand for our products, which may result in lower net sales in future periods. A prolonged global or regional economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks.\nWe manufacture a significant portion of the products sold at our manufacturing facility located in Spanish Fork, Utah. As a result, we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facility in Spanish Fork and our distribution facilities throughout the country. Our manufacturing facilities and distribution facilities are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to, among other things, earthquake, fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters, as well as occurrence of significant equipment failures. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it would be expected to disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs the primary manufacturer of our own products, we are subject to FDA regulations on GMPs, which require us to maintain good manufacturing processes, including ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping. Compliance with these regulations has increased and may further increase our cost of manufacturing products. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if regulatory authorities make determinations that we are not in compliance with FDA regulations on GMPs. A finding of noncompliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties or actions impacting our ability to continue selling certain products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we contract with third-party manufacturers to produce some of our vitamins, mineral and other nutritional supplements, personal care products and certain other miscellaneous products in accordance with our specifications and standards. These contract manufacturers are subject to the same risks as our manufacturing facility as noted above. In addition, while we have implemented stringent quality control procedures to verify that our contract manufacturers comply with our specifications and standards, we do not have full control over their manufacturing activities. Significant delays and defects in our products resulting from the activities of our contract manufacturers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTaxation and transfer pricing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to foreign tax and intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between our U.S. parent company and our foreign subsidiaries. These pricing laws are designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income and expense are reported by our U.S. and foreign entities, and that they are taxed appropriately. Regulators in the United States and in foreign markets closely monitor our corporate structures, intercompany transactions, and how we effectuate intercompany fund transfers. Our effective tax rate could increase and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if regulators challenge our corporate structures, transfer pricing methodologies or intercompany transfers. We are eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the United States for certain foreign taxes actually paid abroad. In the event any audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us, we may not be able to offset the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of U.S. foreign tax credits. Because the laws and regulations governing U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment, we may not be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future. In addition, changes in the amount of our total and foreign source taxable income may also limit our ability to take advantage of foreign tax credits in the future. The various customs, exchange control and transfer pricing laws are continually changing, and are subject to the interpretation of governmental agencies.\nWe collect and remit value-added taxes and sales taxes in jurisdictions and states in which we have determined that nexus exists. Other states may claim, from time to time, that we have state-related activities constituting a sufficient nexus to require us to collect and remit value-added taxes and sales taxes in their state, which would increase our tax liability.\nDespite our efforts to be aware of and to comply with such laws and changes to the interpretations thereof, we may not be able to continue to operate in compliance with such laws. We may need to adjust our operating procedures in response to these interpretational changes, and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nComprehensive tax reform in the United States could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Reform Act\") was enacted in the United States. The Tax Reform Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits.\nNotwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Reform Act is uncertain. Accordingly, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. This annual report does not discuss the Tax Reform Act in depth or the manner in which it might affect holders of our common stock. We urge stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to the Tax Reform Act and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock.\nRisks related to actions on trade by the U.S. and foreign governments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2018, there has been increasing rhetoric, in some cases coupled with legislative or executive action, from several U.S. and foreign leaders regarding the institution or future institution of tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials. U.S. and foreign leaders have also indicated an intent to renegotiate, modify or terminate international trade agreements or policies with foreign countries. It remains unclear what U.S. or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs, international trade agreements and policies. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact our business and/or the U.S. and global economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Some tariffs, changes to international trade agreements and policy changes have been announced and are subject to a number of uncertainties as they are implemented, including future adjustments and changes in the countries excluded from such tariffs. The ultimate reaction of other countries, including individuals in each of these countries, and the impact of these tariffs or other actions on the United States, China, the global economy and our business, financial condition and results of operations, cannot be predicted at this time.\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our business.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of products that are ingested, we could face product liability claims if, among other things, our products are alleged to result in injury to a consumer. We carry product liability insurance coverage; however, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover one or more large claims or the insurer may successfully disclaim coverage as to a pending or future claim, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to intellectual property risks.\nMost of our products are not protected by patents. Restrictive regulations governing the precise labeling of ingredients and percentages for nutritional supplements, the large number of manufacturers that produce products with many active ingredients in common and the rapid change and frequent reformulation of products generally make obtaining patent protection for our products impractical. We have other intellectual property that we consider valuable, including trademarks for the Nature's Sunshine Products and Synergy names and logos. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be unsuccessful and third parties may assert claims against us for infringement of intellectual property rights, which could result in us being required to obtain costly licenses for such rights, to pay royalties or to terminate our manufacturing of infringing products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 56945, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NATR"}
