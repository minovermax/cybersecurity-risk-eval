{"cik": "1364099", "company": "Innophos Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our company involves a significant degree of risk of varying origins, including from our operations and financial matters. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nRaw Materials Availability and Pricing\nOur principal raw materials consist of phosphate rock, sulfur and sulfuric acid, MGA, PPA and energy (principally natural gas and electricity). Our key raw materials are purchased under supply contracts that vary from long term multi-year supply arrangements to annual agreements. Pricing within contracts is typically set according to predetermined formulae dependent on price indices or market prices with pricing for some shorter term contracts set by negotiation with reference to market conditions. The prices we pay under some of these contracts will lag the underlying market prices of the raw material. Approximately 25% of our supply of these principal raw materials is bought under fixed annual pricing arrangements. Pricing for our remaining supply of raw materials typically adjusts in line with changes in market prices. As a general matter, we cannot be sure that the annual or other periodic contracts we have in place for our raw materials can be renewed on similar terms to those currently in place.\nVarious market conditions can affect the price and supply of our raw materials. The primary demand for both phosphate rock and sulfur, globally, is for fertilizer production. The costs of these materials are heavily influenced by demand conditions in the fertilizer market and freight costs, which historically have been volatile. Prices for both materials escalated rapidly during 2007 and 2008, declined during 2009, began to increase again through 2011 and subsequently declined again through 2013 before recovering in 2014. Increased raw material pricing may adversely affect our margins if we are not able to offset costs with sales price increases as we explain under \u201cPrice Competition\u201d below.\nWe import phosphate rock for our Coatzacoalcos, Mexico site from multiple global suppliers. We are currently capable of successfully processing industrial scale quantities of phosphate rock from five separate suppliers, and we expect our requirements for 2015 to be met from these multiple suppliers. Previously, the Coatzacoalcos facility was supplied exclusively by OCP, S.A., a state-owned mining company in Morocco under a 1992 supply agreement that expired in September 2010. Although the Coatzacoalcos facility has made significant advances in its ability to handle alternative grades of rock without adversely affecting operating efficiency, further investment may be required to realize the full benefits of improved process flexibility. Accordingly, process efficiency issues may arise over longer time periods as the plant processes new sources of rock, necessitating further investment or changes in rock suppliers to maintain and improve our current plant processing capabilities. We cannot be sure that efficiency issues will not arise, or if they do, that our existing or other suppliers would be able to supply sufficient additional quantities or grades to meet our full requirements which may weaken our ability to maintain our existing levels of operations. Although the diversification of our supply base has reduced our dependence on any one supplier, overall tight demand conditions in the fertilizer market would mean that our purchases could be constrained should any major supplier experience a significant disruption in its ability to supply us with contracted volumes, for example, as a result of capacity constraints, political unrest, or adverse weather conditions in the areas where that supplier operates.\nNatural gas prices have experienced significant volatility in the past several years. Wide fluctuations in natural gas prices may result from relatively minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, and other factors, both domestic and foreign, that are beyond our control. In addition, natural gas is often a substitute for petroleum-based energy supplies and natural gas prices are positively correlated with petroleum prices. Future increases in the price of petroleum (resulting from increased demand, political instability or other factors) may result in significant additional increases in the price of natural gas. We typically purchase natural gas at spot market prices for use at our facilities which exposes us to that price volatility, except in those instances where, from time to time, we enter into longer term, fixed-price natural gas contracts.\nPage 12 of 79\nMost of our raw materials are supplied to us by either one or a small number of suppliers. Some of those suppliers rely, in turn, on sole or limited sources of supply for raw materials included in their products. Failure of our suppliers to maintain sufficient capability to meet changes in demand or quality, or to overcome unanticipated interruptions in their own sources of supply due to their suppliers' performance failures or from force majeure conditions, such as disaster, political unrest, may prevent them from continuing to supply raw materials as we require them, or at all. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of sole or limited source raw materials or to develop alternative sources on a timely basis if required could result in increased costs, which may be material, in our operations or our inability to properly maintain our existing level of operations.\nPrice Competition\nWe face significant competition in each of our markets. In some markets, our products are subject to price pressure due to factors such as competition from low-cost producers, import competition and regulation, increased attractiveness of the U.S. market because of a strong U.S. dollar, excess industry capacity and consolidation among our customers and competitors. The potential development of lower-cost processing technologies could also modify the competitive landscape. These developments, and particularly future expansions by one or more competitors, could have a negative effect on our pricing abilities. In addition, in the specialty chemicals industry, price competition is also based upon a number of other considerations, including product differentiation and innovation, product quality, technical service, and supply reliability. Thus, new products or technologies developed by competitors may also have an adverse impact on our pricing capability. While we have a number of product quality improvement and product enhancement initiatives underway at any one time, we cannot assure that our efforts in maintaining differentiation will be successful.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced pricing pressure, particularly from significant customers and often coincident with periods of overcapacity in the markets in which we compete. In the past, we have taken steps to reduce costs, focus on higher margin products and resist possible price reductions by structuring our contracts and developing strong \u201cvalue-oriented\u201d non-price related customer service relationships. However, price reductions in the past have adversely affected our sales and margins, including the mix between our high margin and low margin products. If we are not able to offset price pressure when it arises through improved operating efficiencies, reduced expenditures, improved product margin mix and other means, we may be subject to those same effects in the future.\nInnophos has experienced more intense pricing pressures in markets, and for applications, where competing producers, particularly those located in China, have similar product offerings, established supply relationships, and potential cost advantages. Historically, this has occurred most frequently in markets such as South America where Innophos does not have local production capability and for less specialized products such as detergent grade STPP. Chinese phosphate producers generally utilize the \u201cthermal\u201d method, a process more heavily dependent on energy that may be cost advantaged compared to \u201cwet\u201d method producers (such as Innophos) during periods of low energy prices. In addition, North African and some Chinese producers are integrated back to developed reserves of phosphate rock, which also may provide cost advantages to them depending on the markets in which they choose to compete. If the relative competitiveness of Chinese and North African producers increases significantly, or they are successful in extending their product lines to more specialized product applications, pricing pressure on Innophos could increase significantly.\nEnvironmental, Product Regulations and Sustainability Initiative Concerns\nOur operations involve the use, handling, processing, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and some of our products are ingredients in foods, nutritional supplements or pharmaceutical excipients that are used in finished products consumed or used by humans or animals. As a result, we are subject to extensive and frequently changing environmental and other regulatory requirements and periodic inspection by federal, state, and local authorities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and the FDA, as well as other regulatory authorities, including the FRA, and those with jurisdiction over our foreign operations and product markets. Moreover, if we increase operations in other jurisdictions, such as we did in China where a new facility was completed in 2012, we will be subject to additional licensing tests for our facilities and operations and a regulatory environment with which we have little previous experience. Our operations also expose us to the risk of claims for environmental remediation and restoration or for exposure to hazardous materials. Our production facilities require various operating permits that are subject to renewal or modification. Violations of environmental laws, regulations, or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on operating activities, substantial fines, penalties, damages, the rescission of operating permits, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or other costs.\nAdditional laws or regulations focused on phosphate-based products may be implemented in the future. For example, a number of states within the U.S. and Canada countrywide have moved to effectively ban the use of phosphate-based products in consumer automatic dishwashing detergents. The trade association that includes major manufacturers of consumer automatic dishwashing detergents has actively supported these efforts in the U.S. and Canada, with non-phosphate legislation becoming\nPage 13 of 79\neffective in July 2010. In addition, the European Union recently enacted legislation to effectively ban phosphates in consumer detergents with a first phase beginning 2013, and in Australia an industry-led voluntary phosphate ban was expected to take full effect in 2014. These trends and related changes in consumer preferences have already reduced our requirements for auto dish markets and we have responded with a shift in our capabilities to serve other food and industrial applications. Furthermore, although phosphates are still permitted for consumer detergent applications in many Latin American countries and other parts of the world, we cannot be sure that similar bans may not be implemented in some or all of these markets in the future. Additional demand restrictions may arise from producers reformulating to reduce or eliminate phosphate content, as was announced in early 2014 by a major consumer packaged goods manufacturer.\nAdditional laws, regulations or distribution policies focused on reduced use of other phosphate-based products could occur in the future. For example, some U.S. states, including New York, Kansas, Maryland, Illinois and South Dakota, continue to restrict or ban the use of polyphosphoric acid in asphalt road construction, while others have permitted its usage after a thorough evaluation (Georgia in 2012, South Carolina in 2014, and Nebraska in 2015) or are in the process of completing their long term evaluation (California and Colorado). If restrictions are instituted in multiple jurisdictions or throughout the U.S. and Canada, a significant impact on our business could occur.\nChanges in composition or permitted-use regulations in domestic or export countries may affect the regulatory status of our finished products and our ability to sell these products into some markets. Such changes may in turn require us to reformulate or establish alternative raw material sourcing, potentially incurring additional cost. If these measures are not successful, the available markets for our products may be limited.\nMaintaining compliance with health and safety and environmental laws and regulations has resulted in ongoing costs for us. Currently, we are involved in several compliance and remediation efforts and agency inspections concerning health, safety and environmental matters.\nSome existing environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at those locations without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Many of our sites have an extended history of industrial use. Soil and groundwater contamination have been detected at some of our sites, and additional contamination might occur or be discovered at these sites or other sites (including sites which we might acquire or to which we may have sent hazardous waste) in the future. We continue to investigate, monitor or clean-up contamination at most of these sites. Due to the uncertainties associated with environmental investigations and clean-ups and the ongoing nature of the investigations and clean-ups at our sites, we cannot predict precisely the nature, cost, and timing of our future remedial obligations with respect to our sites.\nInternational Operations\nWe have significant production operations in Mexico and Canada, and in 2012 we completed construction of our blending operation for food ingredients at a new facility in China which became operational in 2013. We continually evaluate business opportunities that may expand our operations to other areas beyond our current operations. We believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S. will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. There are inherent risks in international operations, the most notable being currency fluctuations and devaluations, economic and business conditions that differ from U.S. cycles, divergent social and political conditions that may become unsettled or even disruptive, communication and translation delays and errors due to cultural and language barriers and less predictable outcomes from differing legal and judicial systems. Until we gain familiarity with the risk environment on an ongoing basis, our risks in those regards are likely to be greatest as we ramp-up our business operations in China. Among the additional risks potentially affecting our Mexican operations are changes in local economic conditions, currency devaluations, potential disruption from socio-political violence in that country, and difficulty in contract enforcement due to differences in the Mexican legal and regulatory regimes compared to those of the U.S. Risks to our Canadian operations, though generally less than for Mexico, nevertheless include a differing federal and provincial regulatory environment from that in the U.S. and currency fluctuations and devaluations. In the event we establish operations in new regions, our exposures to risks from the noted causes and from other as yet unknown causes may increase.\nOur overall success as a multinational business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social and political conditions. Among other things, we are faced with potential difficulties in building and starting up local facilities, staffing and managing local workforces, and designing and effecting solutions to manage commercial risks posed by local customers and distributors. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business. These risks are not limited to only those countries where we actually operate facilities, but may extend to areas and regions that supply and service our facilities or are supplied and serviced by them.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibit U.S. companies, their subsidiaries and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign\nPage 14 of 79\nofficials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. We sell many of our products in foreign countries through sales agents and distributors whose personnel are not subject to our disciplinary procedures. While we and our subsidiaries are committed to conducting business in a legal and ethical manner wherever we operate, and we communicate and seek to monitor compliance with our policies by all who do business with us, we cannot be sure that all our third party distributors or agents remain in full compliance with the FCPA or comparable local regulation at all times.\nProduct Liability Exposure\nMany of our products are functional or fortification additives used in the food and beverage, consumer product, nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical industries. The sale of these additives and our customers' products that include them involve the risk of product liability and personal injury claims, which may be brought by our customers or end-users of products. While we adhere to stringent quality standards in the course of their production, storage and transportation, our products could be subject to adverse effects from foreign matter such as moisture, dust, odors, insects, mold or other substances, or from excessive temperature variations. Our products may also be susceptible to non-conformance resulting from our raw materials. To mitigate this risk, we conduct extensive diligence and testing protocols regarding our raw material suppliers. Historically, we have not been subject to material product liability claims, and no material claims are outstanding. However, because our products are used in manufacturing a wide variety of our customers' products, including those ingested by humans, and we have concentrated the recent growth of our business in those areas, we cannot be sure we will not be subject to material product liability or recall claims in the future.\nProduction Facility Operating Hazards\nOur production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacturing, handling, storage, and transportation of chemical materials and products, including failure of pipeline integrity, explosions, fires, inclement weather and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, mechanical failures, unscheduled downtime, transportation or utility interruptions, remedial complications, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances, storage tank leaks and other environmental risks. We have implemented and installed various management systems and engineering controls and procedures at all our production facilities to enhance safety and minimize these risks. We also insure our facilities to protect against a range of risks. However, these potential hazards do exist and could cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and environmental and natural resource damage, and may result in a suspension of operations (or extended shutdowns) and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, whose nature, timing, severity and non-insured exposures are unknown.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nWe rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secrecy, and other intellectual property laws to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights on a worldwide basis. Nonetheless, we cannot be sure that any pending patent application or trademark application will result in an issued patent or registered trademark, or that any issued or registered patents or trademarks will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. The use of our intellectual property by others could reduce any competitive advantage we have developed or otherwise harm our business. Moreover, we cannot be sure that our property rights can be asserted in all cases, particularly in an international context, or that we can defend ourselves successfully or cost-effectively against the assertion of rights by others.\nContingency Planning\nWe operate a number of manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Canada, China and Mexico, and we coordinate company activities, including our sales, customer service, information technology systems and administrative services and the like, through headquarters operated in those countries. Our sites and those of others who provide services to them are subject to varying risks of disaster and follow on consequences, both man-made and natural, that could degrade or render inoperable one or more of our facilities for an extended period of time. Such disaster related risks and effects are not predictable with certainty and, although they can be mitigated, they cannot be completely prevented. We seek to mitigate our exposures to physical disaster events in a number of ways. For example, where feasible, we design and engineer the configuration of our plants and the associated supply chains to reduce the likelihood and consequences of disasters. We also have adopted certain contingency plans to guide operation in the event of disruption. Furthermore, we maintain insurance for our facilities (and in maintaining our supply chain require insurance to be maintained by others) against casualties, including extended business interruption, and we continually evaluate our risks and develop new and revised contingency plans for dealing with them and policies for avoiding them in the future. Although we have reviewed and analyzed a broad range of risks applicable to our business, the ones that actually affect us may not be those we have concluded most likely to occur. Furthermore, although our reviews have\nPage 15 of 79\nled to more systematic contingency planning, our plans are in varying stages of development and execution, such that they may not be adequate at the time of occurrence for the magnitude of any particular disaster event that befalls us.\nCertain Financial Risks\nContingencies Affecting Dividends\nAfter our common stock became publicly traded in 2006, our Board of Directors initiated a policy of paying regular quarterly cash dividends, subject to the availability of funds, legal and contractual restrictions and prudent needs of our business. We have maintained that policy and paid dividends continuously since that time, making payments that we believed were prudent and promoted stockholder value. However, we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are normally dependent upon cash dividends, distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries, most directly Innophos, Inc., our primary operating subsidiary, and its intermediate parent or parents, to make dividend payments on our common stock. The amounts available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted by provisions of Delaware law and by direct or indirect limitations in our debt facilities. Further, as allowed by existing debt instruments, we may incur additional indebtedness that may restrict to an even greater degree, or prohibit, the payment of dividends on stock. We cannot be sure the level of our operations or agreements governing our current or future indebtedness will permit us to adhere to our current dividend policy, increase dividends, or pay any dividends at all, or that continued payment of dividends will remain prudent for our business in the future judgment of our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 91614, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "IPHS"}
