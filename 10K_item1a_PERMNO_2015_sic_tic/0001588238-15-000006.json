You should carefully consider the information in this Annual Report, including the matters addressed under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and the following risks before making an investment decision. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nNatural gas, NGL and oil prices are volatile. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe prices we receive for our natural gas, NGL and oil production heavily influence our revenue, operating results profitability, access to capital, future rate of growth and carrying value of our properties. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the commodities market has been volatile. For example, the Henry Hub spot market price had declined from a high of $7.94 per MMBtu on March 5, 2014 to a low of $2.75 per MMBtu on December 25, 2014. Natural gas prices have remained depressed thus far in 2015, and the commodities market will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional economic conditions affecting the global supply of and demand for natural gas, NGLs and oil;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign natural gas, including liquefied natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in or affecting other producing countries, including conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022\nthe level of global exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of global inventories;\n\u2022\nprevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate and expectations about future commodity prices;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities, and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices;\n\u2022\nlocalized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022\nthe actions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting reserves;\n\u2022\nspeculative trading in natural gas and crude oil derivative contracts;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with operating drilling rigs;\n\u2022\nincreased end-user conservation or conversion of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of natural gas and oil and alternative fuels; and\n\u2022\ndomestic, local and foreign governmental regulation and taxes.\nFurthermore, the worldwide financial and credit crisis in recent years reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide, resulting in a slowdown in economic activity and recession in parts of the world. This economic environment reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in lower natural gas, NGL and oil prices.\nIn addition, substantially all of our natural gas production is sold to purchasers under contracts with market-based prices. The actual prices realized from the sale of natural gas differ from the quoted NYMEX Henry Hub price as a result of location differentials. Location differentials to NYMEX Henry Hub prices, also known as basis differentials, result from variances in regional natural gas prices compared to NYMEX Henry Hub prices as a result of regional supply and demand factors. Historically, we have entered into long-term firm transportation arrangements pursuant to which our production is shipped to markets that we expect to be less impacted by basis differentials. In recent years, the cost of new firm transportation projects has risen significantly. There can be no assurance that the net impact of entering into such arrangements, after giving effect to their costs, will result in more favorable sales prices for our production in the future than local pricing. As such, our net sales prices may be materially less than NYMEX Henry Hub prices as a result of basis differentials and/or firm transportation costs.\nLower commodity prices and negative increases in our differentials will reduce our cash flows and borrowing ability. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our reserves as existing reserves are depleted. Lower commodity prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we can produce economically.\nIf commodity prices further decrease or our negative differentials further increase, a significant portion of our development and exploration projects could become uneconomic. This may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. As a result, a substantial or extended decline in commodity prices or an increase in our negative differentials may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nOur development and exploration projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our natural gas reserves.\nThe natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the development and acquisition of natural gas reserves. In 2015, we plan to invest $1,070.0 million in our operations,\nincluding $340.0 million for drilling and completion in the Marcellus Shale, $220.0 million for drilling and completion in the Utica Shale, $120.0 million for leasehold acquisitions and $390.0 million for midstream infrastructure development, including $180.0 million expected to be invested by RMP. Our capital budget excludes acquisitions, other than leasehold acquisitions. We expect to fund our 2015 capital expenditures with existing cash, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. If we do not have sufficient borrowing availability under our revolving credit facilities, including our $550.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (\u201cSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) due to the current commodity price environment or otherwise, we may seek alternate debt financing or reduce our capital expenditures. In addition, a portion of our 2015 capital budget is projected to be financed with cash flows from operations derived from wells drilled on drilling locations not associated with proved reserves in our reserve report. The failure to achieve projected production and cash flows from operations from such wells could result in a reduction to our 2015 capital budget. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, natural gas prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. A reduction in natural gas prices from current levels may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations and through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities; however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets. The issuance of additional indebtedness would require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions.\nOur cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nour access to, and the cost of accessing, end markets for our production;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which our production is sold;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022\nthe levels of our operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow under our revolving credit facilities.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our $550.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility decrease as a result of lower natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our planned capital budget or our operations at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If cash flow generated by our operations or available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDrilling for and producing natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could result in a total loss of investment or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our development and acquisition activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable natural gas production or that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells or that various characteristics of the well will cause us to plug or abandon the well prior to producing in commercially viable quantities.\nOur decisions to purchase, explore or develop prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. For a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, see \u201c-Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\u201d In addition, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences.\nFurther, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including the following:\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including limitations resulting from wastewater disposal, discharge of greenhouse gases, and limitations on hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022\nequipment failures, accidents or other unexpected operational events;\n\u2022\nlack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities;\n\u2022\nlack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, such as blizzards and ice storms;\n\u2022\nissues related to compliance with environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022\ndeclines in natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing at acceptable terms;\n\u2022\ntitle problems; and\n\u2022\nlimitations in the market for natural gas.\nAny of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties.\nOur producing properties are concentrated in the Appalachian Basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nOur producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Appalachian Basin, with a particular concentration in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in these areas. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, water shortages or other weather related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs and changes in regional and local political regimes and regulations. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, a number of areas within the Appalachian Basin have historically been subject to mining operations. For example, third parties may engage in subsurface mining operations near or under our properties, which could cause subsidence or other damage to our properties, adversely impact our drilling or adversely impact our midstream activities or those on which we rely. In such event, our operations may be impaired or interrupted, and we may not be able to recover the costs incurred as a result of temporary shut-ins, the plugging and abandonment of any of our wells or the repair of our midstream facilities. Furthermore, the existence of mining operations near our properties could require coordination to avoid adverse impacts as a result of drilling and mining in close proximity. In connection with our aquisition of Alpha Holdings\u2019 50% interest in our Marcellus joint venture on January 29, 2014, we agreed to continue to acknowledge the dominance of mining by Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. (\u201cAlpha\u201d) within the area of mutual interest of our Marcellus joint venture. As such, in addition to coordinating with Alpha on, and in certain circumstances obtaining the prior approval of Alpha for, future drilling operations, we may also be required to take steps to assure the dominance of the mining operations of Alpha, including the plugging and abandonment of wells at the direction of Alpha upon two years notice. These restrictions on our operations, and any similar restrictions, can cause delays or interruptions or can prevent us from executing our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of natural gas properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties.\nWe have been an early entrant into new or emerging plays. As a result, our initial drilling results in these areas may be less certain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nWe completed our first horizontal well in the Marcellus Shale in October 2010 and in the Utica Shale in June 2014. While our costs to acquire undeveloped acreage in new or emerging plays have generally been less than those of later entrants into a developing play, our drilling results in these areas are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Since new or emerging plays have limited or no production history we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. As a result, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful. Additionally, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments. We cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells.\nDuring the term of the Utica Development Agreements, we will rely on Gulfport for the success of our project in the Southern Contract Area in Belmont County, Ohio, and we may not be able to maximize the value of our properties in the Southern Contract Area as we deem best because we are not in full control of this project.\nDuring the term of the Utica Development Agreements, the success of our operation in the Southern Contract Area in Belmont County, Ohio, will depend in part on the ability of Gulfport to effectively exploit the acreage it operates under the Development Agreement. Please read \u201cItem 1. Business-Exploration and Production Business Segment-Development Agreement and Area of Mutual Interest Agreement.\u201d Pursuant to the Development Agreement, we have designated Gulfport as the operator of our existing and future acreage in the Southern Contract Area. A failure or inability of Gulfport to adequately exploit the acreage it operates would have a significant impact on our results of operations. In addition, other than limitations set forth in the terms of the Development Agreement, we do not control the amount of capital that Gulfport may require for development of properties in the Southern Contract Area. Accordingly, we may be required to allocate capital to development of the Southern Contract Area at times when we otherwise would allocate capital to the Northern Contract Area, our Marcellus Shale acreage or elsewhere or otherwise be forced to terminate the Utica Development Agreements. Under any of these circumstances, our prospects for realization of the potential value of the oil, natural gas and NGL reserves associated with the Southern Contract Area could be adversely affected. Our lack of control may limit our ability to develop our properties in the manner we believe to be in our best interest.\nInsufficient takeaway capacity in the Appalachian Basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized natural gas prices.\nThe Appalachian Basin natural gas business environment has recently experienced periods in which production has surpassed local takeaway capacity, resulting in substantial discounts in the price received by producers such as us. Although additional Appalachian Basin takeaway capacity has been added in recent years, the existing and expected capacity may not be sufficient to keep pace with the increased production caused by accelerated drilling in the area in the short term. Furthermore, the costs associated with securing long-term firm transportation capacity has risen significantly on newer projects. There can be no assurance that the net impact of entering into such arrangements, after giving effect to their costs, will result in more favorable sales prices for our production in the future than local pricing. If we are unable to secure additional gathering and compression capacity and long-term firm takeaway capacity on major pipelines that are in existence or under construction in our core operating area to accommodate our growing production and to manage basis differentials, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to pay fees to our service providers based on minimum volumes regardless of actual volume throughput.\nWe have various gas transportation service agreements in place, each with minimum volume delivery commitments. As of March 1, 2015, our average annual contractual firm transportation and firm sales obligations for 2015, 2016 and 2017 were approximately 813,000 MMBtu/d, 918,000 MMBtu/d and 1,011,000 MMBtu/d, respectively. While we believe that our future natural gas volumes will be sufficient to satisfy the minimum requirements under our gas transportation services agreements based on our current production and our exploration and development plan, we can provide no such assurances that such volumes will be sufficient. We are obligated to pay fees on minimum volumes to our service providers regardless of actual volume throughput, which could be significant. If these fees on minimum volumes are substantial, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to cover these obligations, which may require us to reduce or delay our planned investments and capital expenditures or seek alternative means of financing.\nRestrictions in our existing and future debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to engage in certain activities.\nOur revolving credit facility and the indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) governing the $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior notes due 2022 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) we issued in a private placement on April 25, 2014 (the \u201cSenior Notes Offering\u201d) contain a number of significant covenants (in addition to covenants restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness), including restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nmake loans to others;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers;\n\u2022\nmake certain payments;\n\u2022\nhedge future production or interest rates;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nengage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders; and\n\u2022\npay dividends.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility and the Indenture require us to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios. On certain occasions in the past we have not met these financial covenants. These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility and under the Indenture impose on us.\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations.\nOur Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility limits the amounts we can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the lenders, in their sole discretion, determine on a semi-annual basis based upon projected revenues from the natural gas properties securing our loan. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the facility. Any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of the lenders holding 100% of the commitments. If the requisite number of lenders do not agree to an increase, then the borrowing base will be the lowest borrowing base acceptable to such lenders. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid, or we must pledge other natural gas properties as additional collateral after applicable grace periods. As of December 31, 2014, we did not have any substantial unpledged properties, and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make mandatory principal prepayments required under our revolving credit facility. As of October 2014, the borrowing base under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility was $550.0 million. The commodity prices used by our lenders in our most recent borrowing base determination were not reflective of the substantially lower commodity prices realized in December 2014 and January 2015. Our next scheduled borrowing base redetermination is expected to occur in April 2015.\nA breach of any covenant in our revolving credit facility would result in a default under the facility after any applicable grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the indebtedness outstanding under the relevant facility and in a default with respect to, and an acceleration of, the indebtedness outstanding under other debt agreements that include cross default provisions. The accelerated indebtedness would become immediately due and payable. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nIn certain circumstances we may have to purchase commodities on the open market or make cash payments under our hedging arrangements and these payments could be significant.\nIf our production is less than the volume commitments under our hedging arrangements, or if natural gas or oil prices exceed the price at which we have hedged our commodities, we may be obligated to make cash payments to our hedge counterparties or purchase the volume difference at market prices, which could, in certain circumstances, be significant. As of December 31, 2014, we had entered into NYMEX hedging contracts through December 31, 2017 covering a total of approximately 202 Bcf of our projected natural gas production at a weighted average price of $4.09 per MMBtu. We have also\nentered into Appalachian hedging contracts through December 31, 2016 covering a total of approximately 45 Bcf of our projected natural gas production at a weighted average price of $2.72 per MMBtu. If we have to purchase additional commodities on the open market or post cash collateral to meet our obligations under such arrangements, our cash otherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nIn order to prepare reserve estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.\nActual future production, natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas reserves will vary from our estimates. As a substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history, any significant variance from the above assumption could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust reserve estimates to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, existing commodity prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. Please see \u201c-The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\u201d\nReserve estimates for fields that do not have a lengthy production history are less reliable than estimates for fields with lengthy production histories. Less production history may contribute to less accurate estimates of reserves, future production rates and the timing of development expenditures. A substantial number of our producing wells have been operational for less than two years and estimated reserves vary substantially from well to well. Furthermore, the lack of operational history for horizontal wells in the Utica Shale may also contribute to the inaccuracy of future estimates of reserves and could result in our failing to achieve expected results in the play. A material and adverse variance of actual production, revenues and expenditures from those underlying reserve estimates would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur drilling locations are scheduled out over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. In addition, we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill our drilling locations.\nOur management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain well locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These well locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including natural gas and oil prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, the availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, gathering system and pipeline transportation costs, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the numerous drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas or oil from these or any other drilling locations. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained, the leases for such acreage will expire. Further, certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require unitization with adjacent leaseholds controlled by third parties. If these third parties are unwilling to unitize such leaseholds with ours, this may limit the total locations we can drill. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 1,233 net drilling locations. As a result of the limitations described above, we may be unable to drill many of these locations. In addition, we will require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations, and we may not be able to raise or generate the capital required to do so. Any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these potential locations may not be successful, may not increase our overall\nproved reserves or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business and results of operations. For more information on our drilling locations, see \u201cItem 2. Properties-Exploration and Production Segment-Reserve Data-Determination of Drilling Locations.\u201d\nOur acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. In a highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a substantial lease renewal cost, or if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nLeases on our oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. As of December 31, 2014, we had leases representing 2,905 undeveloped acres scheduled to expire in 2015, 5,694 undeveloped acres scheduled to expire in 2016, 31,988 undeveloped acres scheduled to expire in 2017, 35,498 undeveloped acres scheduled to expire in 2018 and 22,850 undeveloped acres set to expire in 2019 and thereafter. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Moreover, many of our leases require lessor consent to unitize, which may make it more difficult to hold our leases by production. Any reduction in our current drilling program, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs, could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations. Our reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage and the loss of any leases could materially and adversely affect our ability to so develop such acreage.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements in effect at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas average prices without giving effect to derivative transactions. Accordingly, the natural gas price used in our reserve report as of December 31, 2014 was $4.52 per Mcfe, which is not reflective of the substantially lower prices realized in December 2014 and January 2015. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nactual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. As a corporation, we are treated as a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes and our future income taxes will be dependent on our future taxable income. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this Annual Report which could have a material effect on the value of our reserves.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nLeases in the Appalachian Basin are particularly vulnerable to title deficiencies due to the long history of land ownership in the area, resulting in extensive and complex chains of title. In the course of acquiring the rights to develop oil and natural gas, it is standard procedure for us and the lessor to execute a lease agreement with payment subject to title verification. In most cases, we incur the expense of retaining lawyers to verify the rightful owners of the oil and gas interests prior to payment of such lease bonus to the lessor. There is no certainty, however, that a lessor has valid title to its lease\u2019s oil and gas interests. In those cases, such leases are generally voided and payment is not remitted to the lessor. As such, title failures may result in fewer net acres to us. Prior to the drilling of an oil or natural gas well, however, it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest, which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and\nreserves. Accordingly, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss.\nThe development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 51% of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Our approximately 662.4 Bcfe of estimated proved undeveloped reserves will require an estimated $585.3 million of development capital over the next five years. Development of these undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves.\nIf commodity prices decrease to a level such that our future undiscounted cash flows from our properties are less than their carrying value for a significant period of time, we will be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. A writedown constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nUnless we replace our reserves with new reserves and develop those reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our future cash flows and results of operations.\nProducing natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless we conduct successful ongoing development and exploration activities or continually acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our future reserves and production, and therefore our future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of natural gas, we enter into derivative instrument contracts for a significant portion of our natural gas production, including fixed-price swaps. As of December 31, 2014, we had entered into NYMEX hedging contracts through December 31, 2017 covering a total of approximately 202 Bcf of our projected natural gas production at a weighted average price of $4.09 per MMBtu. We have also entered into Appalachian hedging contracts through December 31, 2016 covering a total of approximately 45 Bcf of our projected natural gas production at a weighted average price of $2.72 per MMBtu. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in fair value of our derivative instruments.\nDerivative instruments also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nproduction is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nthere is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received; or\n\u2022\nthere are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments.\nThe use of derivatives may, in some cases, require the posting of cash collateral with counterparties. If we enter into derivative instruments that require cash collateral and commodity prices or interest rates change in a manner adverse to us, our cash otherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced which could limit our ability to make future capital\nexpenditures and make payments on our indebtedness, and which could also limit the size of our borrowing base. Future collateral requirements will depend on arrangements with our counterparties, highly volatile oil and natural gas prices and interest rates.\nOur hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity, which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of our commodity derivative contracts was approximately $196.2 million. Any default by the counterparties to these derivative contracts when they become due would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, derivative arrangements could limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for natural gas, which could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts, our principal exposures to credit risk are through joint interest receivables ($125.3 million at December 31, 2014) and the sale of our natural gas production to natural gas marketing companies ($72.2 million in receivables as of December 31, 2014), including one natural gas marketing company which represented $30.7 million in receivables at December 31, 2014. Joint interest receivables arise from billing entities who own partial interest in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leased properties on which we wish to drill. We can do very little to choose who participates in our wells. We are also subject to credit risk due to concentration of our natural gas receivables with one natural gas marketing company. The largest purchaser of our natural gas during the year ended December 31, 2014 represented approximately 79% of our total sales. We do not require our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur operations are subject to governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities that could exceed current expectations.\nSubstantial costs, liabilities, delays and other significant issues could arise from environmental laws and regulations inherent in drilling and well completion, gathering, transportation, and storage, and we may incur substantial costs and liabilities in the performance of these types of operations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, the discharge of materials into the environment and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. These laws include:\n\u2022\nCAA, and analogous state law, which impose obligations related to air emissions;\n\u2022\nClean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d), and analogous state law, which regulate discharge of wastewaters and storm water from some of our facilities into state and federal waters, including wetlands;\n\u2022\nCERCLA, and analogous state law, which regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for disposal;\n\u2022\nRCRA, and analogous state law, which impose requirements for the handling and discharge of any solid and hazardous waste from our facilities;\n\u2022\nNEPA, which requires federal agencies to study likely environmental impacts of a proposed federal action before it is approved, such as drilling on federal lands;\n\u2022\nSDWA, and analogous state law, which restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development;\n\u2022\nESA, and analogous state law, which seek to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animals, fish and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species; and\n\u2022\nOPA of 1990, which requires oil storage facilities and vessels to submit to the federal government plans detailing how they will respond to large discharges, requires updates to technology and equipment, regulates above ground storage tanks and sets forth liability for spills by responsible parties.\nVarious governmental authorities, including, for example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d), the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and analogous state agencies and tribal governments, have the\npower to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal fines and penalties and liability for non-compliance, the imposition of remedial obligations, costs of corrective action, cleanup or restoration, compensation for personal injury, property damage or other losses, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions or declaratory relief limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, delays in granting permits and cancellation of leases.\nThere is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our business, some of which may be material, due to the handling of our products as they are gathered, transported, processed and stored, air emissions related to our operations, historical industry operations, and water and waste disposal practices. Joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, including CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of natural gas, oil and wastes on, under, or from our properties and facilities. Private parties may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. Some sites at which we operate may be located near current or former third-party oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. In addition, increasingly strict laws, regulations and enforcement policies could materially increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us.\nThe EPA\u2019s National Enforcement Initiatives for 2014 to 2016, includes \u201cAssuring Energy Extraction Sector Compliance with Environmental Laws.\u201d According to the EPA\u2019s website, \u201csome techniques for natural gas extraction pose a significant risk to public health and the environment.\u201d To address these concerns, the EPA\u2019s goal is to \u201caddress incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health and/or the environment.\u201d This initiative could involve a large scale investigation of our facilities and processes, and could lead to potential enforcement actions, penalties or injunctive relief against us.\nWe are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses.\nWe make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations. If the interpretation of laws or regulations, or the laws and regulations themselves, change, our assumptions may change, and any new capital costs may be incurred to comply with such changes. In addition, new environmental laws and regulations might adversely affect our products and activities, including drilling, processing, storage and transportation, as well as waste management and air emissions. For instance, federal and state agencies could impose additional safety requirements, any of which could affect our profitability. Further, new environmental laws and regulations might adversely affect our customers, which in turn could affect our profitability.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from performance of pipeline integrity programs and related repairs.\nPursuant to the authority under the NGPSA and HLPSA, as amended by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act, the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 and the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for certain gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that, in the event of a pipeline leak or rupture could affect \u201chigh consequence areas,\u201d which are areas where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences, including high-population areas, certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas. These regulations require operators of covered pipelines to:\n\u2022\nperform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n\u2022\nidentify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;\n\u2022\nimprove data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022\nrepair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and\n\u2022\nimplement preventive and mitigating actions.\nIn addition, states have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations for certain intrastate gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with applicable pipeline integrity management regulations, as the cost will vary significantly depending on the number and extent of any repairs found to be necessary as a result of pipeline integrity testing, but the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the safe and reliable operation of our pipelines.\nMoreover, changes to pipeline safety laws by Congress and regulations by PHMSA or states that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on us and similarly situated midstream operators. For instance, in August 2011, PHMSA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking and sought public comment on a number of proposed changes to regulations governing the safety of gas transmission pipelines and gathering lines, including, for example, revising the definitions of \u201chigh consequence areas\u201d and \u201cgathering lines\u201d and strengthening integrity management requirements as they apply to existing regulated operators and to currently exempt operators should certain exemptions be removed. Most recently, in an August 2014 GAO report to Congress, the GAO acknowledged PHMSA\u2019s assessment of the safety risks posed by gathering lines and recommended that PHMSA move forward with rulemaking to address larger-diameter, higher-pressure gathering lines, including subjecting such pipelines to emergency response planning requirements that currently do not apply.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls or result in more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject us to increased capital costs, operational delays and costs of operation.\nThe 2011 Pipeline Safety Act is the most recent federal legislation to amend the NGPSA and HLPSA pipeline safety laws, requiring increased safety measures for gas and hazardous liquids pipelines. Among other things, the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation, testing to confirm the material strength of certain pipelines, and operator verification of records confirming the maximum allowable pressure of certain intrastate gas transmission pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act also increases the maximum penalty for violation of pipeline safety regulations from $100,000 to $200,000 per violation per day and also from $1 million to $2 million for a related series of violations. The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act as well as any implementation of PHMSA regulations thereunder or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance by PHMSA or any state agencies with respect thereto could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nChanges in laws or government regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our costs of doing business, limit the areas in which we can operate and reduce our oil and natural gas production, which could adversely impact our business.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, and proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. The SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) program and exempts hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \u201cunderground injection\u201d. Congress has in recent legislative sessions considered legislation to amend the SDWA, including legislation that would repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \u201cunderground injection\u201d and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. The U.S. Congress may consider similar SDWA legislation in the future.\nIn addition, EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published final permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels in those states where EPA is the permitting authority. Also, in May 2014, the EPA issued an advanced notice of proposed rules under the Toxic Substances Control Act that would require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior published a revised proposed rule on May 16, 2013, that would update existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. Further, the EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater, and a draft final report with conclusions about the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources is expected to be available for public comment and peer review sometime in the first half of 2015. Moreover, the EPA is developing effluent\nlimitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and plans to propose these standards in 2015. And other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.\nPresently, hydraulic fracturing is regulated primarily at the state level, typically by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies. Along with several other states, Pennsylvania (where we conduct a majority of our operations) has adopted laws and proposed regulations that require oil and natural gas operators to disclose chemical ingredients and water volumes used to hydraulically fracture wells, in addition to more stringent well construction and monitoring requirements. The chemical ingredient information is generally available to the public via online databases, and this may bring more public scrutiny to hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, local governments may also adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Although the Pennsylvania legislature passed legislation to make regulation of drilling uniform throughout the state, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Robinson Township v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania struck down portions of that legislation. Following this decision, local governments in Pennsylvania may increasingly adopt ordinances relating to drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities, especially within residential areas. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIf new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas exploration and production activities by our customers and, therefore, adversely affect our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed.\nOil and natural gas producers\u2019 operations, especially those using hydraulic fracturing, are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on the ability to obtain water may impact our operations.\nWater is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling, and in particular, hydraulic fracturing, process. Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations, could adversely impact our operations.\nMoreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. The CWA imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into navigable waters. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. The CWA and similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. State and federal discharge regulations prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the natural gas and oil industry into coastal waters. Specific to Pennsylvania, sending wastewater to POTWs requires certain levels of pretreatment that may effectively prohibit such disposal as a disposal option and our continued ability to use injection wells as a disposal option not only will depend on federal or state regulations but also on whether available injection wells have sufficient storage capacities. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Compliance with current and future environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted.\nWe are subject to risks associated with climate change.\nThere is a growing belief that emissions of GHGs may be linked to climate change. Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts and the regulation of GHGs have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including negatively impacting the costs we incur in providing our products and services, the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks. In addition, legislative and regulatory responses related to GHGs and climate change creates the potential for financial risk. The U.S. Congress has previously considered legislation related to GHG\nemissions. There have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of GHGs. In addition, increased public awareness and concern may result in more state, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate GHG emissions. For example, the Obama administration recently announced its Climate Action Plan, which, among other things, directs federal agencies to develop a strategy for the reduction of methane emissions, including emissions from the oil and gas sector.\nOn September 22, 2009, the EPA finalized a GHG reporting rule that requires large sources of GHG emissions to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their GHG emissions beginning January 1, 2010. The rule applies primarily to large facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels, as well as manufacturers of vehicles and engines. Subsequently, on November 8, 2010, the EPA issued GHG monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect on December 30, 2010, specifically for oil and natural gas facilities, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year. The rule requires reporting of GHG emissions by regulated facilities to the EPA by March 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter. We are required to report our GHG emissions to the EPA each year in March under this rule. Recently, the EPA finalized modifications to its GHG reporting rules that would require covered entities to report emissions on an individual GHG basis. In addition, the EPA has proposed a rule that would expand the agency\u2019s reporting requirements to cover completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. These changes to EPA\u2019s reporting rules could result in increased compliance costs.\nThe recent actions of the EPA and the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions program. If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nOur natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable releases of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater, air and shoreline contamination;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u2022\npersonal injuries and death;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters; and\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks targeting natural gas and oil related facilities and infrastructure.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss to us as a result of claims for:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u2022\nrepair and remediation costs.\nIn accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of our business risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer. Also, insurance may no longer be available to us or, if it is, its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial condition. We may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us, which liabilities may not be covered by insurance.\nSince hydraulic fracturing activities are a large part of our operations, they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury, property damage and clean-up costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event. However, we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the \u201coccurrence\u201d to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. We have no coverage for gradual, long-term pollution events. In addition, these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities, and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProperties that we decide to drill may not yield natural gas, NGLs or oil in commercially viable quantities.\nProperties that we decide to drill that do not yield natural gas, NGLs or oil in commercially viable quantities will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our project areas are in various stages of development, ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that consist of recently acquired leasehold acreage or that have limited drilling or production history. If the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit or if we drill dry holes in the future, our business may be materially affected. In addition, there is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield natural gas, NGLs or oil in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of micro-seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether natural gas, NGLs or oil will be present or, if present, whether natural gas, NGLs or oil will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npressure or lost circulation in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failure or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental or contractual requirements; and\n\u2022\nincrease in the cost of, shortages or delays in the availability of, electricity, supplies, materials, drilling or workover rigs, equipment and services.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nIn the future we may make acquisitions of businesses that complement or expand our current business. However, we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms.\nThe success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our credit facilities impose certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions. Our credit facilities also limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to engage in acquisitions of businesses.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions of properties.\nThe successful acquisition of natural gas and oil properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nrecoverable reserves;\n\u2022\nfuture natural gas, NGL or oil prices and their applicable differentials;\n\u2022\noperating costs; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to natural gas, NGL or oil markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory natural gas, NGL or oil transportation arrangements may hinder our access to markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of natural gas, NGLs or oil and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of natural gas, NGL or oil pipeline or gathering system capacity. In addition, if quality specifications for the third-party pipelines with which we connect change so as to restrict our ability to transport product, our access to markets could be impeded. If our production becomes shut in for any of these or other reasons, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until other arrangements were made to deliver the products to market.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur exploration and production and midstream operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations and the permits and other approvals issued thereunder. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase or operational delays may occur if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations.\nFailure to comply with such laws and regulations, including any evolving interpretation and enforcement by governmental authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, we might not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals for our operations. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if we fail to obtain and comply with them, the operation or construction of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs.\nIn addition, new or additional regulations or permitting requirements, new interpretations of requirements or changes in our operations could also trigger the need for Environmental Assessments or more detailed Environmental Impact Statements under NEPA and analogous state laws, as well as litigation over the adequacy of those reviews, which could result in increased costs or delays of, or denial of rights to conduct, our development programs.\nSuch potential regulations could increase our operating costs, reduce our liquidity, delay or halt our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, the discharges of oil, natural gas, NGLs and other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters\u201d for a further description of laws and regulations that affect us.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe and other equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. We cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. Such shortages could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets, which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.\nSection 1(b) of the NGA, exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC, as a natural gas company under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline\u2019s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation, the rates for, and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC. Such regulation could decrease revenues, increase operating costs, and depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the cost-based rate established by the FERC.\nState regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. We cannot predict what new or different regulations federal and state regulatory agencies may adopt, or what effect subsequent regulation may have on our activities. Such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, result of operations and cash flows.\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable FERC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the Energy Policy Act of 2005, or (\u201cEPAct 2005\u201d), FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our systems have not been regulated by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, we are required to report aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. In addition, Congress may enact legislation or FERC may adopt regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to further regulation. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.\nCompetition in the natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for\ninvestment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased over the past three years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations.\nWe depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. The loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are susceptible to the potential difficulties associated with rapid growth and expansion.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years and more than doubled our employee workforce since 2013. Our management believes that our future success depends on our ability to manage the rapid growth that we have experienced and the demands from increased responsibility on management personnel. The following factors could present difficulties:\n\u2022\nincreased responsibilities for our executive level personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased administrative burden;\n\u2022\nincreased capital requirements; and\n\u2022\nincreased organizational challenges common to large, expansive operations.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully manage these potential difficulties.\nSeasonal weather conditions and regulations adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nNatural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions and regulations designed to protect various wildlife. This limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms of and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flow used for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Recent and continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation, and the promulgation of regulations pursuant thereto, could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted on July 21, 2010, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized some regulations, including critical rulemakings on the definition of \u201cswap,\u201d \u201cswap dealer,\u201d and \u201cmajor swap participant\u201d, others remain to be finalized and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFTC to establish rules and regulations setting position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The CFTC\u2019s initial position limits rules were vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. However, on November 5,\n2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing. The CFTC has not yet proposed rules designating any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, for mandatory clearing. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements for swaps entered to hedge its commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. In addition, for uncleared swaps, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require end-users to enter into credit support documentation and/or post initial and variation margin. Posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce our cash available for capital expenditures, therefore reducing our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flows. The proposed margin rules are not yet final, and therefore the impact of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and regulations may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.\nFinally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is lower commodity prices.\nAny of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on us, our financial condition or our results of operations.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated, and additional state taxes on natural gas extraction may be imposed, as a result of future legislation.\nThe Fiscal Year 2015 Budget proposed by the President recommends the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies, and legislation has been introduced in Congress that would implement many of these proposals. Such changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities for oil and gas production; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear, however, whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon such changes could be effective.\nThe passage of this legislation or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn February 2012, the state legislature of Pennsylvania passed a new natural gas impact fee in Pennsylvania. The legislation imposes an annual fee on natural gas and oil operators for each well drilled for a period of fifteen years. The fee is on a sliding scale set by the Public Utility Commission and is based on two factors: changes in the Consumer Price Index and the average NYMEX natural gas prices from the last day of each month. There can be no assurance that the impact fee will remain as currently structured or that new or additional taxes will not be imposed. In addition, there is currently no severance tax imposed on natural gas or oil in Pennsylvania. However, it is possible that a severance tax could be proposed and implemented in the coming years, which would negatively affect our future cash flows and financial condition.\nIn February 2013, the governor of the state of Ohio proposed a plan to enact new severance taxes in fiscal 2014 and 2015. However, the Ohio State Senate did not include a severance tax increase in the version of the budget bill that it passed on June 7, 2013. The possibility remains that the severance tax increase on horizontal wells will resurface during compromise talks on the budget.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately report our\nfinancial results could be adversely affected.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. Prior to the completion of our IPO, we were a private company with limited accounting personnel to adequately execute our accounting processes and other supervisory resources with which to address our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our Marcellus joint venture historically relied on our accounting personnel for its accounting processes. We and our Marcellus joint venture had not maintained effective control environments in that the design and execution of our controls had not consistently resulted in effective review and supervision by individuals with financial reporting oversight roles. The lack of adequate staffing levels resulted in insufficient time spent on review and approval of certain information used to prepare the financial statements of us and our Marcellus joint venture. We concluded that these control deficiencies constituted a material weakness in our control environment and in the control environment of our Marcellus joint venture as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013.\nTo address these control deficiencies, we hired additional accounting and financial reporting staff, implemented additional analysis and reconciliation procedures and increased the levels of review and approval. Additionally, we comprehensively documented and analyzed our system of internal control over financial reporting in preparation for our first management report on internal control over financial reporting required in connection with this Annual Report. We have concluded that the material weakness previously identified had been remediated as of December 31, 2014. Furthermore, while we generally had to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, we are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until our first annual report subsequent to our ceasing to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we may not be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.\nWe cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our shares of common stock. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our shares of common stock.\nRice Holdings, the Rice Energy Irrevocable Trust and NGP Holdings collectively hold a substantial portion of our common stock.\nRice Holdings, Rice Energy Irrevocable Trust, NGP Holdings and Alpha Holdings collectively held approximately 48.8% of our common stock according to the Schedule 13D/A filed on January 14, 2015. So long as Rice Holdings, the Rice Energy Irrevocable Trust and NGP Holdings continue to control a significant amount of our common stock, each will continue to be able to strongly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that a potential transaction is in their own best interests. The existence of significant stockholders may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company. In any of these matters, the interests of Rice Holdings, the Rice Energy Irrevocable Trust and NGP Holdings may differ or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a controlling stockholder.\nConflicts of interest could arise in the future between us and one or more of our sponsors concerning among other things, potential competitive business activities or business opportunities. Any actual or perceived conflicts of interest could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur sponsors include other participants in the energy industry, including Natural Gas Partners and affiliates of the family of Daniel J. Rice III (the Lead Portfolio Manager in the energy division at GRT Capital Partners). Certain of our sponsors and/\nor their affiliates make investments in the U.S. oil and gas industry from time to time. As a result, our sponsors and/or their affiliates may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are significant existing or potential customers. In certain circumstances, they may acquire or seek to acquire assets that we seek to acquire and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us or may be more expensive for us to pursue. Under our certificate of incorporation, certain of our sponsors and/or one or more of their respective affiliates are permitted to engage in business activities or invest in or acquire businesses which may compete with our business or do business with any client of ours.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nproviding that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture place certain restrictions on our ability to do so. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and our Indenture place certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if you sell your common stock at a price greater than you paid for it,f or which there is no guarantee.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings. We may also issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nIn April 2012, President Obama signed into law the JOBS Act. We are classified as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to, among other things, (1) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, (3) provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or (4) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation. We will remain an emerging growth\ncompany for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if we have more than $1.0 billion of revenues in a fiscal year, become a large accelerated filer, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nAfter we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14409, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "RICE"}
