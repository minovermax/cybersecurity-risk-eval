You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our business faces significant risks and uncertainties, and those described below may not be the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of these risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMETELSTAT\nOur future success depends solely on imetelstat, our only product candidate, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to develop imetelstat or advance imetelstat to subsequent clinical trials, or that we will be able to receive regulatory approval for imetelstat on a timely basis, or at all.\nImetelstat is our sole product candidate, upon whose success we are wholly dependent. We do not have any other products or product candidates. Our ability to develop imetelstat to and through regulatory approval and commercial launch is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\ncause the IND for imetelstat to be maintained without such IND being placed on full or partial clinical hold by the FDA;\n\u2022\ngenerate additional safety and efficacy data from existing and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, providing a positive benefit-risk profile that supports the continued and future development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies;\n\u2022\nascertain that the use of imetelstat does not result in significant systemic or organ toxicities, including hepatotoxicity, or other safety issues resulting in an unacceptable benefit-risk profile;\n\u2022\ndevelop clinical plans for, and successfully enroll and complete, potential future clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge;\n\u2022\ncollaborate successfully with clinical trial sites, academic institutions, clinical research organizations, physician investigators and other third parties;\n\u2022\nobtain required regulatory clearances and approvals for imetelstat; for example, it is uncertain:\n\u25aa\nwhether the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries will require us to obtain and submit additional non-clinical, manufacturing, or clinical data to proceed with any potential future clinical trials,\n\u25aa\nhow the FDA and other regulatory authorities will interpret safety and efficacy data from any clinical trial, including from IMbark or IMerge,\n\u25aa\nwhat scope and type of clinical development and other data will be required before the FDA and other regulatory authorities might grant us marketing approval, if any, and\n\u25aa\nwhat the length of time and cost for us will be to complete any such requirements;\n\u2022\nenter into and maintain arrangements with third parties to provide services needed to further research and develop imetelstat, including maintaining the agreement with our CRO, or to manufacture imetelstat, in each case at commercially reasonable costs;\n\u2022\nenter into and maintain arrangements with third parties, or establish internal capabilities, to provide sales, marketing and distribution functions in compliance with applicable laws;\n\u2022\nobtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for the cost of imetelstat from governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nmaintain and enforce adequate intellectual property protection for imetelstat;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate financial resources and personnel to advance imetelstat to and through potential future clinical trials, regulatory approval and commercial launch; and\n\u2022\nobtain funding necessary to fund our operations and to advance the development of imetelstat on commercially reasonable terms, including completion of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and potential clinical development of other indications.\nIf we are not able to successfully achieve the above-stated goals and overcome other challenges that we may encounter in the research, development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat, we may be forced to abandon our development of imetelstat, which would severely harm our business and prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nCommencement of potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, and completion of the extension phase of IMbark and the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, could be interrupted, further delayed or abandoned for a variety of reasons.\nCurrently, there are two active clinical trials of imetelstat, the extension phase of IMbark and the Phase 2 portion of IMerge. Completion of these clinical trials, and the commencement of any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, could be interrupted, delayed or abandoned for a variety of reasons, including as a result of failures or delays in:\n\u2022\nthe comprehensive transition of the imetelstat program from Janssen to us, as discussed in more detail under the heading, \u201cRisks Related to Transition of the Imetelstat Program from Janssen to Geron\u201d;\n\u2022\ndemonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy of imetelstat in IMerge and any potential future clinical trials, without safety issues, side effects or dose-limiting toxicities, including any additional or more severe safety issues in addition to those that have been observed to date in previous or ongoing clinical trials related to imetelstat, whether or not in the same indications or therapeutic areas;\n\u2022\nobtaining or maintaining regulatory clearances in the United States or other countries to conduct clinical trials, such as obtaining or maintaining regulatory clearances to commence, conduct or modify current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, in a timely manner, or at all, which could, for example, cause the anticipated commencement of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge to be delayed beyond mid-year 2019 or prevent us from commencing or completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge;\n\u2022\nmaintaining the IND for imetelstat without such IND being placed on full or partial clinical hold, suspended or subject to other requirements by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nproperly (i) completing the extension phase of IMbark, including collecting data about serious adverse events and overall survival from the extension phase of IMbark; (ii) completing the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, including assessing the durability of RBC-TI responses; and (iii) designing, enrolling, conducting and completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, and promptly or adequately reporting data from such trials;\n\u2022\ndetermining, after consultations with experts in MF and discussions with regulatory authorities, whether the results from the IMbark primary analysis provide a feasible registration path, if any, for imetelstat in Intermediate-2 or High risk MF patients who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor;\n\u2022\nobtaining or accessing necessary clinical data in accordance with appropriate clinical or quality practices to ensure complete data sets;\n\u2022\nresponding to safety findings by the data review committees of current clinical trials, including the extension phase of IMbark and the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, and safety or futility findings by the data review committees of potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, such as the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, based on emerging data occurring during such clinical trials, such as significant systemic or organ toxicities, including severe cytopenias, hepatotoxicity, fatal bleeding with or without any associated thrombocytopenia, patient injury or death, or other safety issues, resulting in an unacceptable benefit-risk profile;\n\u2022\nobtaining funding on commercially reasonable terms necessary to advance the development of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of imetelstat or other clinical trial materials in a manner that meets the quality standards of the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and responding to any disruptions to drug supply, clinical trial materials or quality issues that may arise;\n\u2022\nensuring the ability to manufacture imetelstat at acceptable costs for potential Phase 3 clinical trials and commercialization;\n\u2022\nobtaining sufficient quantities of any study-related treatments, materials (including comparator products, placebo or combination therapies) or ancillary supplies;\n\u2022\nobtaining acceptance by regulatory authorities of manufacturing changes, as well as successfully implementing any such manufacturing changes;\n\u2022\ncomplying with current and future regulatory requirements, policies or guidelines, including domestic and international laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, transparency, and the privacy and security of health information;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms and on a timely basis, if at all, with collaborators and vendors located in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, including contract research organizations, laboratory service providers and clinical trial sites, on all aspects of clinical development;\n\u2022\nobtaining timely review and clearances by regulatory authorities of future protocol amendments which may be sought for the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, including responding to questions or comments from these authorities in a timely and adequate manner, which could, for example, cause the anticipated commencement of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge to be delayed beyond mid-year 2019 or prevent us from commencing or completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge; and\n\u2022\nobtaining institutional review board or ethics committee approval of clinical trial protocols or protocol amendments, including any future refinements to the trial design we may seek for the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, which could, for example, cause the anticipated commencement of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge to be delayed beyond mid-year 2019 or prevent us from commencing or completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge.\nFailures or delays with respect to any of these events could adversely affect our ability to continue or successfully complete the extension phase of IMbark or the Phase 2 portion of IMerge or to commence potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, which could increase development costs, or interrupt, further delay or halt our development or commercialization of imetelstat, any of which could severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nImetelstat may cause, or have attributed to it, undesirable or unintended side effects or other adverse events that further delay or prevent the commencement and/or completion of clinical trials for imetelstat, further delay or prevent its regulatory approval, or limit its commercial potential.\nImetelstat may cause, or have attributed to it, undesirable or unintended side effects or other adverse events affecting its safety or efficacy that could interrupt, further delay or halt current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat. For example, adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities observed in previous clinical trials of imetelstat include:\n\u2022\nhematologic toxicities, such as profound and/or prolonged thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, including one case of febrile neutropenia after prolonged myelosuppression with intracranial hemorrhage resulting in patient death, which the investigator assessed as possibly related to imetelstat;\n\u2022\nbleeding events, with or without thrombocytopenia;\n\u2022\nliver function test, or LFT, abnormalities, the clinical significance and long-term consequences of which are currently undetermined;\n\u2022\ngastrointestinal events;\n\u2022\ninfections;\n\u2022\nmuscular and joint pain;\n\u2022\nfatigue; and\n\u2022\ninfusion reactions.\nSuch adverse events and other safety issues, including deaths, were also observed in IMbark and the Phase 2 portion of IMerge. If patients in any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, experience similar or more severe adverse events, or new or unusual adverse events, or if the FDA or other regulatory authorities determine that efficacy and safety data in current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat do not support an adequate benefit-risk profile to justify continued treatment of patients, then the FDA or other regulatory authorities may again place the IND for imetelstat on clinical hold, as occurred in March 2014.\nFurther, clinical trials by their nature examine the effect of a potential therapy in a sample of the potential future patient population. As such, clinical trials conducted with imetelstat, to date and in the future, may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients treated with imetelstat may experience. Because remaining patients in the treatment phase continue to receive imetelstat, in the extension phase of IMbark and in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, additional or more severe toxicities or safety issues, including additional serious adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities, may be observed as patient treatment continues and more data become available. In addition, since additional data are being generated from the extension phase of IMbark and Part 1 of IMerge, the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat will continue to be assessed, including the risk of hepatotoxicity, severe cytopenias, fatal bleeding with or without any associated thrombocytopenia, patient injury or death, and any other severe adverse effects that may be associated with life-threatening clinical outcomes. If such toxicities or other safety issues in any clinical trial of imetelstat are determined by us, the FDA or any other regulatory authority to result in an unacceptable benefit-risk profile, then:\n\u2022\nadditional information supporting the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat may be requested by the FDA or other regulatory authorities and if any such information supplied by Janssen, or by us following the transition of the imetelstat program to us is not deemed acceptable, current clinical trials of imetelstat could be suspended, terminated, or placed on clinical hold by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe ability to retain enrolled patients in current clinical trials may be negatively affected, resulting in incomplete data sets and the inability to adequately assess the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in a specific patient population; or\n\u2022\nadditional, unexpected clinical trials or non-clinical studies may be required to be conducted.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could interrupt, further delay, or halt, any development and commercialization of imetelstat by us, which would have a severe adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and the future of imetelstat, any of which might cause us to cease operations.\nResults obtained in prior non-clinical studies and clinical trials do not predict success in later clinical trials. Likewise, preliminary data from clinical trials should be considered carefully and with caution since final data may be materially different from preliminary data, particularly as more patient data become available.\nSuccess in non-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. We cannot be certain that any of the prior, current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat will generate sufficient, consistent or adequate efficacy and safety data demonstrating a positive benefit-risk profile, which would be necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market imetelstat in any indication. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired benefit-risk profile despite having progressed through non-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. Other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have frequently suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in earlier non-clinical studies or clinical trials.\nSafety and efficacy data from previous or current imetelstat clinical trials in hematologic myeloid malignancies should not be relied upon as predictive or indicative of future clinical trial results. For example, complete and partial remissions observed in the Pilot Study suggested potential disease-modifying activity of imetelstat in the MF patient population enrolled in the Pilot Study. However, similar activity was not observed in the MF patients enrolled in IMbark, as shown by the one partial remission observed in the IMbark primary analysis. We believe that differences in the IMbark study design when compared to the Pilot Study design, such as more restrictive patient enrollment criteria requiring either documented objective lack of response to a JAK inhibitor or evidence of progressive disease while on treatment with a JAK inhibitor, may have contributed to the data observed in IMbark differing significantly from data reported from the Pilot Study, but we cannot assure you that any future clinical trials of imetelstat in MF will yield results comparable to IMbark or the Pilot Study. In addition, the potential improvement in survival observed in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm in IMbark will need to be further assessed in a Phase 3 clinical trial comparing imetelstat to a control therapy, and similar results, including potential improvement in survival, if any, with respect to any patient population or patient population subgroup, may not be observed.\nSimilarly, in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, the initial data review for the expansion cohort conducted by Janssen in the second quarter of 2018, which Janssen called a \u201cdata snapshot,\u201d exhibited 8-week RBC-TI rate of 28%, while the 13-patient initial cohort exhibited 8-week RBC-TI rate of 54% resulting in an overall 8-week RBC-TI rate of 37% for the combined cohorts. We believe the observed difference in 8-week RBC-TI rate between the 13-patient initial cohort and the 25-patient expansion cohort may be attributable to factors such as the maturity of the data at the time of the data snapshot since the median follow-up time of the expansion cohort at the time of the data snapshot was less than half the length of time the 13-patient initial cohort had been followed when their data were first reported, or the higher overall baseline transfusion burden of the expansion cohort, but we cannot assure you that the combined 8-week RBC-TI rate observed in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge will improve with longer follow-up, or at all, or that the 8-week RBC-TI rate of patients enrolled in the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, if any, will be comparable to what has been observed in the 13-patient initial cohort, the expansion cohort, or the combined cohorts.\nAdditional or updated safety and efficacy data from current or potential future imetelstat clinical trials may result in a benefit-risk profile that does not justify continued development of imetelstat in a particular patient population, or at all. For example, because patients remaining in the treatment phase continue to receive imetelstat, in the extension phase of IMbark and the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, efficacy and safety data continue to be generated. Such additional data could result in a lower benefit-risk profile than initially expected, which could hinder the commencement, completion and potential success in the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or could cause us to abandon further development of imetelstat entirely. Data from the Phase 3 portion, of IMerge could materially differ from the overall conclusions reported for the Phase 2 portion of IMerge. In general, Phase 3 clinical trials with larger numbers of patients or longer durations of therapy may fail to replicate efficacy results observed in earlier clinical trials, or may reveal safety concerns that were not identified in smaller or shorter trials, any of which could adversely affect future development prospects of imetelstat.\nFrom time-to-time, safety and efficacy data from previous and current imetelstat clinical trials have been reported or announced by us, clinical investigators or Janssen. For example, preliminary data from the Phase 2 portion of IMerge was presented at the ASH annual meetings in December 2017 and December 2018, and at the EHA annual congress in June 2018. We expect similar reports or announcements of safety and efficacy data from us or clinical investigators as data matures in current imetelstat clinical trials and from potential future clinical trials. Preliminary or interim results may not be reproduced in any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, and thus should be considered carefully and with caution, and not relied upon as indicative of future clinical results. Material adverse differences in final data, compared to preliminary or interim data, could severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nThe research and development of imetelstat is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe science and technology of telomere biology, telomerase and our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry are relatively new. There is no precedent for the successful commercialization of a therapeutic product candidate based on these technologies. Significant research and development activities will be necessary to further develop imetelstat, which is our sole product candidate, which may take years to accomplish, if at all.\nBecause of the significant scientific, regulatory and commercial challenges that must be overcome to successfully research, develop and commercialize imetelstat, the development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies, including MF and MDS, or any other indications, may be further delayed or abandoned, even after significant resources have been expended on it. Examples of such situations include:\n\u2022\nthe discontinuation of our Phase 2 clinical trial of imetelstat in metastatic breast cancer in September 2012;\n\u2022\nthe discontinuation of our development of imetelstat in solid tumors with short telomeres in April 2013;\n\u2022\nJanssen\u2019s decisions in the third quarter of 2016 to close the 4.7 mg/kg dosing arm in IMbark to new patient enrollment and to suspend enrollment in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm in IMbark because an insufficient number of patients in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm met the protocol defined interim efficacy criteria at 12 weeks;\n\u2022\nJanssen\u2019s decision in the third quarter of 2017 to expand the Phase 2 portion of IMerge to enroll additional lower risk MDS patients in a target patient population; and\n\u2022\nJanssen\u2019s decision in September 2018 to terminate the Collaboration Agreement.\nFurther delay, suspension or abandonment of the development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies, including further delays resulting from the termination of the Collaboration Agreement, transition of the imetelstat program from Janssen to us, and our ability to successfully plan for and commence future clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, could have a material adverse effect on the future of imetelstat and our business prospects, and we might cease operations.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling or retaining patients in current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, including in the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, clinical development and commercialization activities could be further delayed or otherwise adversely affected, which would cause our business and business prospects to be severely harmed, and we might cease operations.\nThe timely completion of a clinical trial in accordance with its protocol depends, among other things, on the ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. For example, if we experience difficulties in retaining patients in the extension phase of IMbark, our ability to continue to assess OS would be adversely affected. If we experience difficulties in retaining patients in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, our ability to continue to assess the durability of RBC-TI responses would be adversely affected. In addition, we may encounter challenges in enrolling and retaining patients in potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, for a variety of reasons. The enrollment and retention of patients depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe patient eligibility criteria specified in the protocol;\n\u2022\nthe size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoint;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of patients to trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe design of the trial;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit and retain clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022\nclinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions of the potential advantages of imetelstat, both in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications being investigated, and as a result of data reported from previous or current clinical trials of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that patients enrolled in any imetelstat clinical trial will drop out of the trial before completion due to lack of efficacy, adverse side effects, investigator decision, slow progress to later stage clinical trials or personal issues.\nIn addition, potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, will compete, with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas with imetelstat and such trials may also be conducted at the same clinical sites, and this competition will reduce the number and type of patients available to enroll or remain in the imetelstat clinical trials. Moreover, because imetelstat represents a departure from more commonly used methods for cancer treatment, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies, rather than enroll patients into imetelstat clinical trials, or may decide not to enroll, or may not recommend enrollment, in future clinical trials of imetelstat, based on efficacy and safety results reported to date and that may be reported in the future.\nDelays in patient enrollment or the inability to retain or treat patients could result in increased costs, lead to incomplete data sets, or adversely affect the timing or outcome of current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect the clinical development and potential commercialization of imetelstat. Such occurrences would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nWe do not have experience as a company in conducting large-scale, late-stage clinical trials, such as the Phase 3 portion of IMerge or potential future similar trials, or in those functional areas that would be required for the successful commercialization of our sole product candidate, imetelstat.\nWe have no experience in conducting large-scale, late-stage clinical trials, such as the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, nor do we have experience with activities that would be required for the commercialization of imetelstat, should we receive future regulatory approval to do so. We cannot be certain that we will be able to design, enroll, conduct or complete the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or any other future large-scale, late-stage clinical trial of imetelstat, in a timely fashion, or at all. Large-scale, late-stage clinical trials require additional financial resources and certain internal development experience that we do not currently possess, as well as increased reliance on third-party clinical investigators, CROs, service providers, vendors, suppliers and consultants. Relying on these third parties and establishing effective and collaborative relationships with them to conduct large-scale, late-stage clinical trials may cause further delays that are outside of our control. Any such further delays could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also do not have commercialization capabilities. Developing an internal sales, marketing and distribution capability would be an expensive and time-consuming process, and will require additional management expertise. We may not be able to negotiate and enter into third-party marketing and distribution agreements on terms that are economically attractive, or at all. Even if we do enter into such agreements, third party marketers and distributors may not successfully market or distribute our sole product candidate, imetelstat.\nOur inability to successfully conduct large-scale, late-stage clinical trials, such as the Phase 3 portion of IMerge or future similar trials, or to successfully establish commercialization capabilities for imetelstat if we receive future regulatory approval to do so, would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nWe will rely on third parties to conduct our current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to continue the development of, obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize imetelstat.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials. Therefore, we will rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, service providers, vendors, suppliers and consultants, to conduct clinical trials of imetelstat. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our clinical trials will play a critical role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. However, these third parties are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control their performance, or the amount or timing of resources that they devote to imetelstat. For example, the CRO we have retained to support our clinical development activities will be critical to our development of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, and any failure by our CRO to perform its contractual obligations, or disputes with our CRO about the quality of its performance or other matters, could cause the anticipated commencement of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge to be delayed beyond mid-year 2019 or\nprevent us from commencing or completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or could otherwise further delay or halt our imetelstat development activities. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. Under certain circumstances, these third parties may terminate their agreements with us without cause and upon immediate written notice.\nAlthough we will rely on third parties to conduct any imetelstat clinical trials, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, we remain responsible for ensuring that each clinical trial is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, including regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that patients are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our ability to comply with these regulations and standards is contingent upon activities conducted by third parties, and if they fail to perform in accordance with contractual obligations and legal requirements, our development of imetelstat may be interrupted, further delayed or halted, which would have a severe adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and the future of imetelstat, any of which might cause us to cease operations.\nIn addition, the execution of clinical trials and the subsequent compilation and analysis of the data produced, requires coordination among various parties. In order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently, it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another. If the quality or accuracy of the clinical data obtained, compiled or analyzed by third parties is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties, which could be difficult, costly or impossible. If third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, or may be unsuccessful or need to be repeated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might cause us to cease operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO TRANSITION OF THE IMETELSTAT PROGRAM FROM JANSSEN TO GERON\nEncountering delays or difficulties in transitioning the imetelstat program from Janssen to us would prevent us from timely developing imetelstat, or preclude us from developing imetelstat at all, which could severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nUnder the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is required to provide operational support for the imetelstat program during transition of the program to us. The transition process is expected to occur through September 2019, to enable the orderly transfer of all ongoing clinical, regulatory, medical affairs and non-clinical activities to us, including transfer of the sponsorship of ongoing imetelstat clinical trials from Janssen to us. In addition, following the effective date of termination of the Collaboration Agreement, we expect Janssen to supply imetelstat to us for up to 24 months during a transition period for clinical manufacturing and such supply will be charged to us at Janssen\u2019s cost plus a premium. Our future clinical development plans for imetelstat substantially depend on the timely and comprehensive transition of the imetelstat program from Janssen to us. Delays in completing the transition activities or unwillingness by Janssen to fully perform all of the transition activities will further delay or preclude the clinical development of imetelstat, increase our operating costs and thereby negatively impact our financial results, as well as harm imetelstat\u2019s future prospects, any of which could severely and adversely affect our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nDuring the transition period, we remain dependent on Janssen for several key operational development areas. Poor or incomplete performance by Janssen in these areas could severely and adversely affect imetelstat\u2019s future value and our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nDuring the transition period, we will remain dependent on Janssen to perform certain activities related to imetelstat, which subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nJanssen may not perform as expected or required by the Collaboration Agreement, and we are not able to control the amount or timing of the resources that Janssen may devote to the transition;\n\u2022\nthere may be disputes between us and Janssen that result in the delay of the transition, or the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial objectives, or affect our license to the proprietary rights arising\nunder the Collaboration Agreement, which may result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\nthe manner and timing in which Janssen effects the transition could adversely impact the development of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nfailure by Janssen to comply with applicable regulatory guidelines could result in our inability to assume sponsorship responsibility for the IND for imetelstat or to plan for and commence future clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or could result in administrative or judicially imposed sanctions on us, including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, product seizures or detention, product recalls, total or partial suspension of manufacturing activities, and the potential refusal to approve any new drug applications;\n\u2022\nour ability to transfer and subsequently maintain the IND for imetelstat and to submit required regulatory reports within required timelines may be compromised if Janssen is not fully cooperative in transferring all data and information from the imetelstat program, including IMbark and IMerge, to us;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in Janssen\u2019s business strategy or failure to apply financial and other resources to the transition may also adversely affect Janssen\u2019s ability to perform its obligations related to transition of the imetelstat program to us; and\n\u2022\nJanssen may not properly maintain or defend intellectual property rights arising from the Collaboration Agreement, may use our proprietary information in such a way as to cause disputes that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation, or may disclose our proprietary information in a manner that could put our intellectual property rights at risk.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could severely and adversely affect imetelstat\u2019s future value and our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY APPROVAL\nAND COMMERCIALIZATION OF IMETELSTAT\nMaintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to continue the clinical development of imetelstat, and obtaining future regulatory clearances to potentially market imetelstat, in the United States and other countries, is a costly and lengthy process, and we cannot predict when or if regulatory authorities will permit additional imetelstat development or when or if regulatory authorities will approve imetelstat for commercial sale.\nFederal, state and local governments in the United States and governments in other countries have significant regulations in place that govern drug research and development and may prevent us from successfully conducting development efforts or commercializing imetelstat. Delays in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals or limitations in the scope of such clearances or approvals could:\n\u2022\nimpede or halt our clinical development activities and plans;\n\u2022\nsignificantly harm the commercial potential of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nimpose additional development costs;\n\u2022\ndiminish any competitive advantages that may have been available to us; or\n\u2022\nfurther delay or preclude any revenue we may receive from the future commercialization of imetelstat, if any.\nBefore we can seek to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of imetelstat, multiple clinical trials, including larger-scale Phase 3 clinical trials, will need to be conducted to demonstrate if imetelstat is safe and effective for use in a diverse population. Significant additional research, non-clinical testing and clinical testing is required before we can file any application with the FDA or other regulatory authorities for regulatory approval of imetelstat. As such, we do not expect imetelstat to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Our clinical development program for imetelstat may not lead to regulatory approval from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities if we fail to demonstrate that imetelstat is safe and effective. If imetelstat cannot be developed in potential future clinical trials, including in Phase 3 clinical trials, our business and business prospects would be severely and adversely affected, and we might cease operations. Even if we do successfully complete one or more future clinical trials of\nimetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, those results are not necessarily predictive of results of future pivotal trials that may be needed before we may submit an NDA to the FDA for the initial or other future indications. We may therefore fail to further develop or commercialize imetelstat.\nIf our interpretation of safety and efficacy data obtained from non-clinical studies and clinical trials varies from interpretations by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries, this would likely further delay, limit or prevent further development and approval of imetelstat. For example, the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries may require more or different data than what has been generated from our non-clinical studies and previous or ongoing clinical trials, even though protocols for these trials may have been reviewed by FDA and any resulting feedback incorporated. In addition, delays or rejections of regulatory approvals, or limitations in marketing authorizations, may be encountered as a result of changes in the regulatory environment or regulatory policy during the period of product development and/or the period of review of any application for regulatory approval for imetelstat.\nThe benefit-risk profile of imetelstat will also affect the assessment by the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries of the drug\u2019s cost-effectiveness and/or marketability, which assessment could prevent or limit its approval for marketing and successful commercial use. If regulatory submissions requesting approval to market imetelstat are submitted, the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries may conclude that the overall benefit-risk profile of imetelstat treatment does not merit approval of imetelstat for marketing or further development for any indication. Any of these events could cause us to halt future development and commercialization of imetelstat, if any, which would severely harm our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nImetelstat must receive all relevant regulatory approvals before it may be marketed in the United States or other countries. Obtaining regulatory approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. For example, in June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of exiting the European Union, and in March 2017, the Government of the United Kingdom initiated the formal procedure of withdrawal from the European Union. Although the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will not be known for some time, this could lead to a period of considerable uncertainty in relation to the regulatory process in Europe, which could result in a delay in the review of regulatory submissions made in Europe by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including potentially by us in the future, and could also lead to less efficient, more expensive, and potentially lengthier regulatory review processes for companies like us, who may seek to obtain regulatory approval for drug products in the European Union or the United Kingdom. Such changes could adversely affect and/or delay our ability to obtain approval of, and market and sell, imetelstat in the United States. In addition, because imetelstat involves the application of new technologies and a new therapeutic approach, it may be subject to substantial additional review by various government regulatory authorities, and, as a result, the process of obtaining regulatory approvals for imetelstat may proceed more slowly than for product candidates based upon more conventional technologies, and any approval that may be received could limit the use of imetelstat. We do not expect imetelstat to be approved for commercial sale for many years, if at all.\nEven if the necessary time and resources are committed by us, the required regulatory clearances and approvals may not be obtained for imetelstat. Further, if regulatory clearances and approvals are obtained to commence commercial sales of imetelstat, they may impose significant limitations on the indicated uses or other aspects of the product label for which imetelstat can be marketed. An approval might also be contingent on the performance of costly additional post-marketing clinical trials. Any failure to advance imetelstat to subsequent clinical trials, failure to obtain regulatory approval of imetelstat, or limitations on any regulatory approval that we might receive, could reduce the potential commercial use of imetelstat, and potential market demand for imetelstat and therefore result in decreased revenue for us from any commercialization of imetelstat, any of which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nAlthough orphan drug designation has been granted to imetelstat for the treatment of MF and MDS, these designations may not be maintained, which would eliminate the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including the potential for market exclusivity, which would likely result in decreased sales revenue from commercialization of imetelstat, if any, and would likely harm our business and business prospects.\nThe FDA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat in June 2015 for the treatment of MF and for the treatment of MDS in December 2015, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted it in December 2015 for the treatment of MF. The designation of imetelstat as an orphan drug does not guarantee that any regulatory authority\nwill accelerate regulatory review of, or ultimately approve, imetelstat, nor does it limit the ability of any regulatory authority to grant orphan drug designation to product candidates of other companies that treat the same indications as imetelstat prior to imetelstat receiving any exclusive marketing approval.\nWe may lose orphan drug exclusivity if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for orphan drug designation was materially defective or if we cannot ensure sufficient quantities of imetelstat to meet the needs of patients with MF or MDS.\nEven if we maintain orphan drug exclusivity for imetelstat, the exclusivity may not effectively protect imetelstat from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug product is approved, the FDA or EMA can subsequently approve a different drug with the same active moiety for the same condition, if the FDA or EMA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. The occurrence of any of these events could result in decreased sales of imetelstat, should it ever receive marketing approval, and may harm our business and business prospects. In addition, orphan drug designation will neither shorten the development time nor regulatory review time for imetelstat, and does not give imetelstat any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nA Fast Track designation by the FDA, such as the Fast Track designation received for imetelstat, does not guarantee approval and may not lead to a faster development, regulatory review or approval process.\nIn October 2017, the FDA granted fast track designation for the imetelstat clinical development program for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low or Intermediate-1 risk MDS who are non-del(5q) and who are refractory or resistant to treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent. Fast track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA review staff, as well as eligibility for priority review, if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review. Fast track designation is intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of a New Drug Application to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. However, fast track designation does not accelerate conduct of clinical trials or mean that the regulatory requirements are less stringent, nor does it ensure that imetelstat will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. In addition, the FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the imetelstat clinical development program.\nFailure to achieve continued compliance with government regulations could delay or halt commercialization of imetelstat.\nApproved products and their manufacturers are subject to continual review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or its manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer, including import restrictions, seizure and withdrawal of the product from the market. If approved for commercial sale, future sales of imetelstat will be subject to government regulation related to numerous matters, including the processes of:\n\u2022\nmanufacturing;\n\u2022\nadvertising and promoting;\n\u2022\nselling and marketing;\n\u2022\nlabeling; and\n\u2022\ndistribution.\nIf, and to the extent that, we are unable to comply with these regulations, our ability to earn potential revenue from the commercialization of imetelstat, if any, would be materially and adversely impacted.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in severe civil and criminal penalties, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nrecall or seizure of products;\n\u2022\ninjunctions against the import, manufacture, distribution, sales and/or marketing of products; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nThe imposition of any of these penalties or other commercial limitations would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING IMETELSTAT\nFailure by Janssen to manufacture or provide adequate clinical quantities of imetelstat on a timely basis, or at all, for the period required by the Collaboration Agreement, or our failure to establish a manufacturing supply chain to appropriately and adequately supply imetelstat for future clinical and commercial uses, would result in a further delay in or cessation of clinical trials and a further delay in or our inability to obtain regulatory approvals of imetelstat, and our business and business prospects could be severely harmed, and we could cease operations.\nPursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is required to supply imetelstat to us until September 28, 2020 while we are planning to re-establish our own manufacturing supply chain. Consequently, we will remain dependent on Janssen to appropriately supply imetelstat and other clinical trial materials until such date or when we re-establish our own manufacturing supply chain. Thereafter, we will be responsible for the manufacture and supply of imetelstat for future clinical and commercial uses. The process of manufacturing imetelstat is complex and subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe ability to scale-up and attain sufficient production yields with appropriate quality control and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nreliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nsupply chain issues, including the timely availability and shelf life requirements of raw materials and other supplies;\n\u2022\nshortage of qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements, which are less well-defined for oligonucleotide products than for small molecule drugs and vary in each country where imetelstat might be sold or used.\nAs a result of these and other risks, Janssen may not perform as agreed or may default in its obligations to supply clinical quantities of imetelstat for the period of time required by the Collaboration Agreement, or may fail to deliver the required quantities of imetelstat on a timely basis, or at required or applicable quality standards, which would result in a further delay or cessation of current and potential future clinical trials and otherwise significantly further delay our ability to develop imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations. In addition, our inability to establish a manufacturing supply chain capable of providing imetelstat for clinical trials and potential future commercial uses following the termination of Janssen\u2019s obligation to supply us with imetelstat would further delay or result in a cessation of potential future clinical trials and would further delay or preclude any applications for regulatory approval and therefore further delay or preclude our ability to earn revenue from the commercialization, if any, of imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIf third parties that manufacture imetelstat fail to perform as needed, then the clinical and commercial supply of imetelstat will be limited, and we may be unable to conduct future clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or to commercialize imetelstat in the future.\nFollowing the termination of Janssen\u2019s obligation to supply us with imetelstat, we expect to rely solely upon third-party contractors to perform certain process development or other technical and scientific work with respect to imetelstat, as well as to supply starting materials and manufacture drug substance and drug product. We currently have no arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of imetelstat, and the establishment of such arrangements could further delay, perhaps substantially, or preclude our ability to pursue imetelstat development on our own, increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our financial results, business and business prospects. We may not be able to obtain third-party manufacturers for imetelstat on acceptable terms, or at all. We expect to rely on third-party contractors to produce and deliver sufficient quantities of imetelstat and other materials to support clinical trials on a timely basis and to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. We will not have direct control over these\nthird-party personnel or operations. Reliance on these third-party manufacturers is subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nbeing unable to identify suitable third-party manufacturers, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require significant activities to validate and qualify any replacement manufacturer, which could involve new testing and compliance inspections;\n\u2022\nbeing unable to contract with third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe inability of third-party manufacturers to timely formulate and manufacture imetelstat or to produce imetelstat in the quantities or of the quality required to meet clinical and commercial needs;\n\u2022\ndecisions by third-party manufacturers to exit the contract manufacturing business during the time required to supply clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute products;\n\u2022\ncompliance by third-party manufacturers with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, standards mandated by the FDA and state agencies and other government regulations corresponding to foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nbreach or termination of manufacturing contracts;\n\u2022\ninadequate storage at contracted facilities resulting in theft or spoilage;\n\u2022\ncapacity limitation and scheduling imetelstat manufacturing activities as a priority in contracted facilities; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters that affect contracted facilities.\nEach of these risks could lead to delays or shortages in drug supply, or the inability to manufacture drug supply necessary for non-clinical and clinical activities, and commercialization. For example, manufacturing delays could adversely impact the completion of current clinical trials, such as the extension phase of IMbark and the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, or the commencement of potential future clinical trials, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, which could severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIn addition, third-party contractors and/or any other contractors may need to make substantial investments to enable sufficient capacity increases and cost reductions, and to implement those regulatory and compliance standards necessary for successful Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial production of imetelstat. These third-party contractors may not be willing or able to achieve such capacity increases, cost reductions, or regulatory and compliance standards, and even if they do, such achievements may not be at commercially reasonable costs. Changing manufacturers may be prolonged and difficult due to inherent technical complexities and because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIt may not be possible to manufacture imetelstat at costs or scales necessary to conduct clinical trials or potential future commercialization activities.\nOligonucleotides are relatively large molecules produced using complex chemistry, and the cost of manufacturing an oligonucleotide like imetelstat is greater than the cost of making typical small-molecule drugs. Therefore, imetelstat for clinical use is more expensive to manufacture than most other treatments currently available today or that may be available in the future. Similarly, the cost of manufacturing imetelstat for commercial use will need to be significantly lower than current costs in order for imetelstat to become a commercially successful product. We may not be able to achieve sufficient scale increases or cost reductions necessary for successful commercial production of imetelstat. Failure to achieve necessary cost reductions could result in decreased sales, if any, for us, which would materially and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO MANAGING OUR GROWTH AND OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nWe may be unable to successfully retain or recruit key personnel to support the development and potential future commercialization of imetelstat or to otherwise successfully manage our growth.\nOur ability to successfully develop imetelstat in the future and to potentially commercialize imetelstat depends to a significant extent on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers and key members of our staff. In addition, we will need to hire a number of senior personnel to re-staff our internal drug development group, as well as to contract with subject matter experts in clinical science, biostatistics, clinical operations, pharmacovigilance, quality systems, manufacturing and regulatory affairs, to enable us to further develop and potentially commercialize imetelstat.\nWe face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and other research institutions, and competition in our geographic region is particularly intense. Termination of the Collaboration Agreement by Janssen, as well as the previous restructurings we implemented, and the uncertainties regarding our future business viability could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel or we may incur unanticipated inefficiencies caused by our reduced personnel resources. We may also face higher than expected personnel costs in order to attract new management or development personnel, or to maintain our current executive officers and staff. If we are unable to successfully retain, motivate and incentivize our existing personnel, or to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified management and senior development personnel in the future on acceptable terms, our ability to further develop imetelstat will be impaired, and our business and the price of our common stock would be adversely impacted.\nAs our operations potentially expand, we expect that we will need to manage new and additional relationships with various service providers, vendors, suppliers and other third parties, as well as additional office locations, for example, our planned office opening in northern New Jersey. Such potential growth and expansion will require members of our management to assume significant added responsibilities. Our performance in managing any such future growth, if ineffective, could negatively impact our business prospects. We may not successfully manage our anticipated imetelstat development efforts and potential future imetelstat clinical trials, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, effectively. If we fail to achieve key development goals, our abilities to grow as a company, and to further develop and commercialize imetelstat, could be prevented or hindered, and our business and business prospects would be severely harmed, which might cause us to cease operations.\nWe expect imetelstat to remain our sole product candidate for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize imetelstat, our business and business prospects would be severely harmed, which might cause us to cease operations.\nWe plan to focus our efforts on the further development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies. Accordingly, we do not currently have any plans to engage in any efforts to discover new product candidates or to seek to acquire and/or in-license other oncology products, product candidates, programs or companies in order to diversify our business. Since we do not currently have a discovery function or capabilities, and do not plan to establish such capabilities or to seek to diversify our product candidate portfolio through acquisition and/or in-licensing activity, we will be wholly reliant upon the development of imetelstat, our sole product candidate, for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize imetelstat, our business and business prospects would be severely harmed, which might cause us to cease operations.\nIf we are unable to establish potential future collaborative arrangements for imetelstat, we may have to delay, alter or abandon our imetelstat development and commercialization plans.\nWe intend to develop imetelstat broadly for hematologic malignancies, and to potentially commercialize, market and sell imetelstat by ourselves in the United States. We plan to seek another collaborative partner or partners, at an appropriate time, to assist us in the potential development and commercialization of imetelstat outside the United States, and to provide funding for such activities. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborative partners, and these potential collaborative arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be able to negotiate collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all. In this regard, collaborative arrangements with third parties may require us to relinquish material rights, including revenue from potential commercialization, on terms that are less attractive than under the Collaboration Agreement we had with Janssen, or to assume material ongoing development obligations that we would have to fund or otherwise support.\nIn any event, we are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any collaborative arrangements because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing collaborative arrangements. Moreover, as a result of the termination of the Collaboration Agreement and the significant uncertainty regarding the future imetelstat development program, potential collaborative partners may be less willing to enter into new collaborative arrangements with us, or may only be willing to do so on terms that are not favorable to us. As a result, we may not be successful in finding a new collaborative partner or partners on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to negotiate collaborative arrangements, we may have to:\n\u2022\ncurtail the development of imetelstat,\n\u2022\nfurther delay, alter or abandon the imetelstat development program,\n\u2022\nfurther delay or abandon its potential commercialization,\n\u2022\nreduce the scope of potential future sales or marketing activities, or\n\u2022\nincrease our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense, which will require substantial additional capital than our current resources.\nIn order to advance the imetelstat program, including completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and potential clinical trials in other indications, as well as potential commercialization activities in the United States, we will need to raise substantial additional capital. In addition, if we elect to increase our expenditures to fund imetelstat development or commercialization activities outside the United States on our own, we will be required to substantially increase our personnel resources and we will need to obtain substantial further capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to advance the imetelstat program, including completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge or clinical trials in other indications, or to bring imetelstat to market and generate product revenues. Establishing the infrastructure necessary to further develop, commercialize, market and sell imetelstat worldwide will require substantial resources and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and negatively impact our imetelstat development or commercialization efforts in the United States.\nWe currently have no products approved for commercial sale and we have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain marketing approvals for any product candidates, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe have never derived any revenue from the sales of any products. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring, developing and securing our technology, undertaking non-clinical studies and early stage clinical trials of imetelstat and past product candidates that we have subsequently discontinued, and engaging in research and development under collaboration agreements. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approvals, formulate and manufacture commercial-scale products, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, for these and other reasons discussed elsewhere in these risk factors, it is difficult to predict our future success and the viability of our business and the imetelstat program.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities in order to protect ourselves against product liability claims or claims related to clinical trial conduct.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic and diagnostic products. We may become subject to product liability claims or claims related to clinical trial conduct if the use of imetelstat is alleged to have injured patients, including any injuries alleged to arise from any hepatotoxicity or hemorrhagic event associated with the use of imetelstat. We currently have limited clinical trial liability insurance, and we may not be able to maintain this type of insurance for any clinical trials, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or this type of insurance may become too expensive for us to afford because of the highly risky and uncertain nature of clinical trials generally and the high cost of insurance for our business activities. In addition, business liability and product liability insurance are becoming increasingly expensive, particularly for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and the pool of insurers offering insurance coverage to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is becoming smaller, making it more difficult to obtain insurance for our business activities at a reasonable price, or at all. Being unable to obtain or\nmaintain product liability, clinical trial liability, or other insurance for our business activities in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, involved in securities-related legal actions that are expensive and time consuming. Any securities-related legal actions, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nSecurities-related class action lawsuits and/or derivative lawsuits have often been brought against companies, including biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies, that experience volatility in the market price of their securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because we often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with our product development activities.\nWe and certain of our officers were named as defendants in two purported class action securities lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, or the California District Court, as well as a third securities lawsuit, not styled as a class action, which was transferred to the California District Court. These three cases, or the Class Action Lawsuits, were consolidated for all purposes and settled in July 2017. In connection with the settlement, in April 2017, we paid $250,000 and our insurance providers paid $6.0 million to a settlement escrow account to be paid to members of the settlement class, less payment of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to plaintiff\u2019s counsel.\nThe termination of the Collaboration Agreement could also result in litigation arising out of any claims that our stockholders suffered financial losses. The market price of our common stock declined significantly after the announcement on September 27, 2018 of the termination of the Collaboration Agreement, and certain stockholders experienced significant financial losses. Therefore, it is possible that lawsuits will be filed naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants with respect to the termination of the Collaboration Agreement by Janssen or other matters related to the Collaboration Agreement, future clinical trials of imetelstat, if any, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or other business activities. Monitoring, initiating and defending against legal actions is time-consuming for our management, is likely to be expensive and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the settlement or defense of any additional lawsuits, and we may not prevail in such lawsuits. Additionally, we may not be successful in having any such lawsuit dismissed or settled within the limits of our insurance coverage.\nWe have not established any reserve for any potential liability relating to any lawsuits. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests in any such lawsuit, or in similar or related litigation, could result in the payment of substantial damages, or possibly fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, our stock price, cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to third-party litigation, and such litigation would be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome.\nOur business may bring us into conflict with our licensees, licensors, or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships, or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours. We may experience employment-related disputes as we seek to expand our personnel resources. If we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties, we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us.\nWe may face litigation with Janssen arising from or related to the Collaboration Agreement and Janssen\u2019s termination of it. Possible disagreements with Janssen could include disagreements regarding the transition of the imetelstat program from Janssen back to us, or the ownership of proprietary rights arising from the work performed by Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement. We may become involved in performance or other disputes with the CRO we have retained to support our imetelstat clinical development activities, or with other third parties such as service providers, vendors, suppliers or consultants, which could result in a further delay or cessation of current and potential future clinical trials and otherwise significantly further delay our ability to develop imetelstat.\nLawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and defense and disposition costs depend upon many unknown factors. Despite the availability of insurance, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with litigation. Lawsuits could result in judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain\nactivities, or otherwise negatively affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, the inherent uncertainty of such litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price and a decrease in the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment in our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur success and the success of our planned future development of imetelstat will depend on our ability to protect our technologies and imetelstat through patents and other intellectual property rights.\nProtection of our proprietary technology is critically important to our business. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and extend our patents and maintain trade secrets, both in the United States and in other countries. Our patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and our patent rights may not provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us. In the event that we are unsuccessful in obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights or having our licensors maintain the intellectual property rights we have licensed, the value of our technologies and imetelstat will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to further develop or potentially commercialize imetelstat. Loss or impairment of our intellectual property related to imetelstat might further delay or halt ongoing or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat and any applications for regulatory approval, and therefore further delay or preclude any future development or commercialization of imetelstat by us. Further, if imetelstat is approved for commercial sale, such events could impair our ability to sell imetelstat and therefore result in decreased sales for us. Occurrence of any of these events would materially and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign patent law or interpretations of such patent laws could diminish the value of our patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our technologies and imetelstat.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical questions. In particular, legal principles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents in the United States and in other countries are evolving, and the extent to which we will be able to obtain patent coverage to protect our technologies and imetelstat, or enforce or defend issued patents, is uncertain.\nSince the publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by at least several months and sometimes several years, the persons or entities that we name as inventors in our patents and patent applications may not have been the first to invent the inventions disclosed in the patent applications or patents, or the first to file patent applications for these inventions. As a result, we may not be able to obtain patents for discoveries that we otherwise would consider patentable and that we consider to be extremely significant to the future success of imetelstat. Thus, our ability to protect our patentable intellectual property depends, in part, on our ability to be the first to file patent applications with respect to our inventions or inventions that were developed by Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement and to which we have an exclusive license for the further development, commercialization and manufacture of imetelstat. Delay in the filing of a patent application for any purpose, including further development or refinement of an invention, may result in the risk of loss of patent rights.\nA number of significant changes to U.S. patent law occurred when the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the AIA, was signed into law on September 16, 2011. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are examined and may affect patent litigation. Many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA, and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. For example, the AIA limits where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nU.S. court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. For example, on June 13, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court, or the Court, issued a decision in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. holding that claims to isolated genomic DNA were not patentable subject matter, but claims to complementary DNA, or cDNA, molecules were patentable subject matter. On March 20, 2012, in Mayo Collaborative Services, DBA Mayo Medical Laboratories, et al. v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Court held that several claims drawn to measuring drug metabolite levels from patient samples and correlating them to drug doses were not patentable subject matter. In addition, court rulings in cases such as BRCA1- & BRCA2-Based Hereditary Cancer Test Patent Litig. and Promega Corp. v. Life Technologies Corp. have also narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances. In addition\nto increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events may have created uncertainty with respect to the value of certain patents we have previously obtained or in-licensed.\nIn addition, in June 2016, the electorate of the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union, and in March 2017 the Government of the United Kingdom initiated the formal procedure of withdrawal from the European Union. While the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union is planned, the exact timing of the withdrawal and the resulting effect of withdrawal will not be known for some time, which could lead to a period of considerable uncertainty relating to our ability to obtain and maintain Supplementary Protection Certificates of our products based on our United Kingdom patents and our ability to establish and maintain European trademarks in the United Kingdom.\nIn 2012, the European Union Patent Package, or EU Patent Package, regulations were passed with the goal of providing for a single pan-European Unity Patent, or UP, and a new European Unified Patent Court, or UPC, for litigation of European patents. Once established, the UPC would have jurisdiction over traditional European patents and new UPs in the United Kingdom and all Contracting Member States of the European Union. However, political activity in the United Kingdom and a legal challenge in Germany has delayed ratification of the EU Patent Package in these countries. There have been many delays in the implementation of the EU Patent Package, and further delays may occur. When the EU Patent Package is ratified and in effect, all European patents, including those issued prior to ratification, would by default automatically fall under the jurisdiction of the UPC and allow for the possibility of obtaining pan-European injunctions. Under the EU Patent Package as currently proposed, once the UPC is established, patent holders are permitted to \u201copt out\u201d of the UPC on a patent-by-patent basis, although the time permitted for this opt-out is not yet known. Owners of traditional European Patent applications who receive notice of grant after the EU Patent Package is ratified could validate the patent nationally, and file an opt-out demand. The EU Patent Package may increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement or defense of our issued European patents. The full impact on future European patent filing strategy and the enforcement or defense of our issued European patents in member states and/or the UPC is not known.\nDepending on decisions by the U.S. federal courts, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the Patent Office, and similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the interpretation of laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents. Occurrence of these events and/or significant impairment of our imetelstat patent rights would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, which might cause us to cease operations.\nChallenges to our owned or licensed patent rights would result in costly and time-consuming legal proceedings that could prevent or limit development of imetelstat.\nOur patents or those patent rights we have licensed, including patent rights that we may seek with respect to inventions made by Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement, may be challenged through administrative or judicial proceedings, which could result in the loss of important patent rights. For example, where more than one party seeks U.S. patent protection for the same technology, the Patent Office may declare an interference proceeding in order to ascertain the party to which the patent should be issued. Patent interferences are typically complex, highly contested legal proceedings, subject to appeal. They are usually expensive and prolonged, and can cause significant delay in the issuance of patents. Our pending patent applications or our issued patents, or those we have licensed and may license from others, including Janssen, may be drawn into interference proceedings or be challenged through post-grant review procedures or litigation, any of which could delay or prevent the issuance of patents, or result in the loss of issued patent rights.\nUnder the AIA, interference proceedings between patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013 have been replaced with other types of proceedings, including derivation proceedings. The AIA also includes post-grant review procedures subjecting U.S. patents to post-grant review procedures similar to European oppositions, such as inter partes review, or IPR, covered business method post-grant reviews and other post-grant reviews. This applies to all of our U.S. patents and those we have licensed and may license from others, including Janssen, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard necessary to invalidate a patent claim in Patent Office proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal court, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a Patent Office proceeding sufficient for the Patent Office to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third\nparty could attempt to use the Patent Office procedures to invalidate patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. U.S. patents owned or licensed by us may therefore be subject to post-grant review procedures, as well as other forms of review and re-examination. In addition, the IPR process under the AIA permits any person, whether they are accused of infringing the patent at issue or not, to challenge the validity of certain patents. As a result, entities associated with hedge funds have challenged valuable pharmaceutical patents through the IPR process. Significant impairment of our imetelstat patent rights would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, which might cause us to cease operations.\nCertain jurisdictions, such as Europe, New Zealand and Australia, permit oppositions to be filed against granted patents or patents proposed to be granted. Because we may in the future seek to commercialize imetelstat internationally, securing both proprietary protection and freedom to operate outside of the United States is important to our business. Opposition proceedings require significant time and costs, and if we are unsuccessful or are unable to commit these types of resources to protect our imetelstat patent rights, we could lose our patent rights and we could be prevented or limited in the development and commercialization of imetelstat.\nAs more groups become engaged in scientific research and product development in the areas of telomerase biology and hematologic malignancies, the risk of our patents, or patents that we have in-licensed, being challenged through patent interferences, derivation proceedings, IPRs, post-grant proceedings, oppositions, re-examinations, litigation or other means will likely increase. For example, litigation may arise as a result of our decision to enforce our patent rights against third parties. Challenges to our patents through these procedures would be extremely expensive and time-consuming, even if the outcome was favorable to us. An adverse outcome in a patent dispute could severely harm our ability to further develop or commercialize imetelstat, or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, and might cause us to cease operations, by:\n\u2022\ncausing us to lose patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction(s);\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to litigation, or otherwise preventing us from commercializing imetelstat in the relevant jurisdiction(s);\n\u2022\nrequiring us to obtain licenses to the disputed patents;\n\u2022\nforcing us to cease using the disputed technology; or\n\u2022\nrequiring us to develop or obtain alternative technologies.\nWe may be subject to infringement claims that are costly to defend, and such claims may limit our ability to use disputed technologies and prevent us from pursuing research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of imetelstat.\nThe commercial success of imetelstat will depend upon our ability to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell imetelstat without infringing or otherwise violating the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and many pharmaceutical companies, including potential competitors, have substantial patent portfolios. In the event our technologies infringe the rights of others or require the use of discoveries and technologies controlled by third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of imetelstat, or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or other proprietary rights or develop or obtain alternative technologies. For example, we are aware that certain third parties have or may be prosecuting patents and patent estates that may relate to imetelstat, and while we believe these patents will expire before imetelstat is commercialized and/or that these patents are invalid and/or would not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of imetelstat, it is possible that the owner(s) of these patents will assert claims against us in the future. If that were to occur, we would need to obtain unblocking licenses from such third parties, develop alternative non-infringing technologies, which we may not be able to do at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms, or at all, or cease the development of imetelstat. In addition, while Janssen has terminated the Collaboration Agreement, we are still subject to indemnification obligations to Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement, including with respect to claims of third party patent infringement.\nSince we cannot be aware of all intellectual property rights potentially relating to imetelstat and its uses, we do not know with certainty that imetelstat, or the intended commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe or otherwise violate any third party\u2019s intellectual property. Any infringement claims against us would likely be expensive to resolve, and the cost of any unblocking license that we could be required to obtain is unpredictable and could be significant. If we are unable to resolve an infringement claim successfully, we could be subject to an injunction that would prevent us from commercializing imetelstat and could also require us to pay substantial damages. In addition to infringement claims, in the future we may also be subject to other claims relating to intellectual property, such as claims that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of third parties. Provided that we are successful in continuing the development of imetelstat, we expect to see more efforts by others to obtain patents that are positioned to cover imetelstat. Our success therefore depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and the proprietary rights of others.\nWe may become aware of discoveries and technologies controlled by third parties that are advantageous or necessary to further develop or manufacture imetelstat. For example, as we transition the imetelstat program from Janssen to us, we may learn of changes to the imetelstat manufacturing process made by Janssen which would require us to obtain licenses to third party intellectual property rights. Under such circumstances, we may initiate negotiations for licenses to other technologies as the need or opportunity arises. We may not be able to obtain a license to a technology required for the research, development, manufacture or commercialization of imetelstat on commercially favorable terms, or at all, or such licenses may be terminated on certain grounds, including as a result of our failure to comply with the obligations under such licenses. If we do not obtain a necessary license or if such a license is terminated, we may need to redesign such technologies or obtain rights to alternative technologies, which may not be possible, and even if possible, could cause further delays in the development efforts for imetelstat and could increase the development and/or production costs of imetelstat. In cases where we are unable to license necessary technologies, we could be subject to litigation and prevented from researching, developing, manufacturing or commercializing imetelstat which would materially and adversely impact our business. Failure by us to obtain rights to alternative technologies or a license to any technology that may be required to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize imetelstat would further delay potential future clinical trials of imetelstat and any applications for regulatory approval, impair our ability to sell imetelstat and therefore result in decreased sales of imetelstat for us. Occurrence of any of these events would materially and adversely affect our business, and might cause us to cease operations.\nWe may become involved in disputes with past or future collaborator(s), including Janssen, over intellectual property inventorship or ownership, and publications by us, or by investigators, scientific consultants, research collaborators or others could impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information, which, in either case, could have a significant impact on our business.\nInventions discovered under research, material transfer or other collaborative agreements, including our Collaboration Agreement with Janssen which was terminated effective September 28, 2018, may become jointly owned by us and the other party to such agreements in some cases, and may be the exclusive property of either party in other cases. Under some circumstances, it may be difficult to determine who invents and owns a particular invention, or whether it is jointly owned, and disputes can arise regarding inventorship and ownership of those inventions. These disputes could be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome could have a significant adverse effect on our business if we were not able to protect our license rights to these inventions. In addition, clinical trial investigators, scientific consultants and research collaborators generally have contractual rights to publish data and other proprietary information, subject to review by the trial sponsor. Publications by us, or by investigators, scientific consultants, previous employees, research collaborators or others, either with permission or in contravention of the terms of their agreements with us or with Janssen or otherwise, may impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect proprietary information which would have a material adverse effect on our business, and might cause us to cease operations.\nMuch of the information and know-how that is critical to our business is not patentable, and we may not be able to prevent others from obtaining this information and establishing competitive enterprises.\nWe sometimes rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology, especially in circumstances in which we believe patent protection is not appropriate or available. We attempt to protect our proprietary technology in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and contractors. We cannot provide assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors, any of which would harm our business significantly.\nIn May 2016, the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, or the DTSA, was enacted, providing a federal cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets. Under the DTSA, an employer may not collect enhanced damages or attorney fees from an employee or contractor in a trade secret dispute brought under the DTSA, unless certain advanced provisions are observed. We cannot provide assurance that our existing agreements with employees and contractors contain notice provisions that would enable us to seek enhanced damages or attorneys\u2019 fees in the event of any dispute for misappropriation of trade secrets brought under the DTSA.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. Our computer and information technology systems, and those of our collaborators, service providers and contractors, are potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, malware, computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures that may result in damage to or the impairment of key business processes, or the loss or corruption of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. Such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The costs to us to mitigate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. In addition, we will rely on our collaborators, service providers and contractors to establish and maintain appropriate information technology systems and data security protections. However, except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control their actions related to such matters. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our imetelstat development program. For example, the loss of clinical study data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in potential regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.\nIn addition, our computer and information technology systems, as well as those of our collaborators, service providers and contractors, are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches, whether by employees, contractors, consultants, malware, phishing attacks, or other cyber-attacks, that may expose confidential information, intellectual property, proprietary business information or personal information to unauthorized persons. If a data security breach affects our systems or those of third parties upon which we rely, corrupts our data or results in the unauthorized disclosure or release of personally identifiable information by our collaborators, service providers, contractors or us, our reputation could be materially damaged and we could be subject to significant fines, increased costs or loss of revenue. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, supervisory bodies, credit reporting agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal, state and foreign data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations and guidelines, if applicable. These may include state breach notification laws, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR. Accordingly, a data security breach or privacy violation that leads to unauthorized access to, disclosure or modification of personal information (including protected health information), that prevents access to personal information or materially compromises the privacy, security, or confidentiality of the personal information, could result in fines, increased costs or loss of revenue as a result of:\n\u2022\nharm to our reputation;\n\u2022\nfines or penalties imposed on us by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nadditional compliance obligations or enforcement measures under federal, state or foreign laws;\n\u2022\nremediation and corrective action we undertake as required by law or as otherwise necessary;\n\u2022\nlitigation and potential civil or criminal liability; and\n\u2022\nrequirements to verify the accuracy of affected data.\nIf we are unable to prevent such data security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive patient data. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have implemented security measures to protect our computer and information technology systems, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, become more sophisticated, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we or our collaborators, service providers or contractors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to data security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nChanges in and failures to comply with U.S. and foreign privacy and data protection laws, regulations and standards may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to or affected by numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal data, such as information that we collect about patients and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials in the United States and abroad. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our or our collaborators\u2019, service providers\u2019 and contractors\u2019 ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our collaborators, service providers and contractors to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulation, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising.\nIn the United States, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) on June 28, 2018, which takes effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nOur operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we, our collaborators, service providers and contractors must comply. For example, the EU has adopted the GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018 and introduces strict requirements for processing the personal information of EU subjects, including clinical trial data. The GDPR has and will continue to increase compliance burdens on us, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and process information about them. The processing of sensitive personal data, such as physical health condition, may impose heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators. In addition, the GDPR provides for more robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. As we expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING\nOur failure to obtain additional capital when needed could force us to further delay, reduce or eliminate development of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or our potential future imetelstat commercialization efforts, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nSuccessful drug development and commercialization requires significant amounts of capital. We will require substantial additional capital in order to further advance the imetelstat program, including conducting the research and development and clinical and regulatory activities necessary to bring imetelstat to market, such as completion of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and potential clinical trials in other indications, and to establish sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize imetelstat in the United States on our own, if regulatory approval is granted. Because the outcome of any clinical activities and/or regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate whether any development activities we may undertake will succeed, and we may never recoup our investment in any imetelstat development, which would adversely affect our financial condition and our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs;\n\u2022\nthe progress, timing, magnitude, scope and costs of clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of imetelstat, including the number of indications being pursued, subject to clearances and approvals by the FDA and other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, duration, results and costs of current and future clinical trials, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, as well as non-clinical studies and assessments, of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews or other regulatory actions related to imetelstat, including obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals in the United States and in other countries;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nthe costs of manufacturing imetelstat, including our ability to meaningfully reduce those manufacturing costs;\n\u2022\nthe costs of multiple third-party vendors and service providers, including our CRO, to support the development, manufacturing and commercialization of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish, enforce and maintain collaborative or other strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing, manufacturing, commercialization and marketing of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully market and sell imetelstat, if imetelstat receives future regulatory approval or clearance, in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nour need to hire additional qualified employees and consultants to support the development and commercialization of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of building a U.S. sales force to market and sell imetelstat, should it receive regulatory clearance;\n\u2022\nthe sales price for imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement for imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with potential future litigation; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of maintaining and operating facilities in California and New Jersey, including higher expenses for travel, telecommunications and administrative oversight.\nAs a result of the termination of the Collaboration Agreement effective September 28, 2018, we are responsible for funding all clinical development, manufacturing, intellectual property maintenance and commercial activities for imetelstat. In order to further advance the imetelstat program, including completion of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and potential clinical trials in other indications, we will need to raise substantial additional capital or establish additional collaborative arrangements with third-party collaborative partners, which may not be possible. In addition, as a result of the termination of the Collaboration Agreement, we will not receive any further milestone payments or royalties from Janssen for the development or sale of imetelstat, including any clinical development milestones. If we are unable to raise additional capital or establish alternative collaborative arrangements with third-party collaborative partners for imetelstat, the development of imetelstat may be further delayed, altered or abandoned, which might cause us to cease operations. Additional financing through public or private equity financings, including pursuant to our 2018 Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR, capital lease transactions or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We may raise equity capital at a stock price or on other terms that could result in substantial dilution of ownership for our stockholders. The receptivity of the public and private equity markets to proposed financings is substantially affected by the general economic, market and political climate and by other factors which are unpredictable and over which we have no control. In this regard, continued volatility and instability in the global financial markets and political climate could adversely affect our ability to raise additional funds through financings and the terms upon which we may raise those funds.\nIn addition, we may seek additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that materially and adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through alliance, collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to imetelstat or our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe cannot assure you that our existing capital resources, future interest income, and potential future sales of our common stock, including under our 2018 Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR, will be sufficient to fund our operating plans. We will need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements to advance the imetelstat program in clinical development and potential commercialization, and our need for additional funds may arise sooner than planned. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, if at all, we may be unable to pursue further development or potential commercialization of imetelstat, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe currently have no source of product revenue and may never become consistently profitable.\nAlthough we were profitable in 2015 due to the recognition of revenue in connection with the upfront payment from Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement, we have otherwise never been profitable and have incurred operating losses every year since our operations began in 1990. We will not receive any future milestone-based or royalty payments from Janssen relating to imetelstat, nor will Janssen share the cost of ongoing or future clinical trials of imetelstat or the costs for patents that were licensed to them under the terminated Collaboration Agreement, after September 28, 2018. We expect to incur significant additional operating losses and, as we assume responsibility for imetelstat clinical development activities, our operating losses are likely to substantially increase. As of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was approximately $1.01 billion. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nSubstantially all of our revenues to date have been payments under collaborative agreements and milestones, royalties and other revenues from our licensing arrangements. With the termination of the Collaboration Agreement effective September 28, 2018, we have no ongoing collaborative agreements related to imetelstat. Any revenues generated from our remaining licensing agreements related to our telomerase technology are expected to be minimal, and will be insufficient to sustain our operations. Our telomerase-related licensing revenues declined significantly in 2018 due to the expiration of the patents underlying such technology, and are expected to be eliminated later in 2019. We have no current plans to enter into any new corporate collaboration, partnership or license agreements that result in revenues, and our remaining telomerase-related license agreements may be terminated by the other parties to such licenses, or expire with the underlying patents.\nWe also expect to experience increased negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operations and assume full payment responsibility for imetelstat clinical development activities. This will result in decreases in our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Further, we may be unable to replenish our working capital by future financings. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve consistent future profitability. We may never achieve consistent future profitability. Even if we do become profitable in the future, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to achieve consistent future profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and our ability to sustain operations.\nThe comprehensive U.S. tax reform bill passed in 2017 could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law legislation, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, that significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The legislation, among other things, contained significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%; reduction in the percentage of allowable expenses eligible for orphan drug credit purposes; limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks; immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time; and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall long-term impact of the federal tax law changes are uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the federal tax law changes. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the 2017 federal income tax law changes, federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the federal tax law changes. In addition, under Section 382 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. Changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, may have resulted or could in the future result in an ownership change. If a limitation were to apply, utilization of a portion of our domestic net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could be limited in future periods. In addition, a portion of the carryforwards may expire before being available to reduce future income tax liabilities which could adversely impact our financial position.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND FINANCIAL REPORTING\nHistorically, our stock price has been extremely volatile.\nHistorically, our stock price has been extremely volatile. Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018, our stock has traded as high as $8.73 per share and as low as $0.86 per share. Between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018, the price has ranged between a high of $6.99 per share and a low of $0.95 per share. The significant market price fluctuations of our common stock have been due to and may in the future be influenced by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\ntermination of the Collaboration Agreement by Janssen in September 2018;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding the research and development of imetelstat, or results of, further delays in, discontinuation of, or further modifications or refinements to any clinical trials of imetelstat for any reason, including as a result of the failure to successfully transition the imetelstat program to us by Janssen, or our inability, for any reason, to successfully continue the development of imetelstat after any such transfer;\n\u2022\npreliminary, interim or final clinical trial data reported with respect to current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, and investor perceptions thereof;\n\u2022\nnot receiving timely regulatory clearances or approvals in any jurisdiction, whether within or outside of the United States, including, if we do not obtain regulatory clearance to commence, conduct or continue clinical trials of imetelstat in MF, MDS or any additional hematologic myeloid malignancies in a timely manner or at all, or to amend any clinical trial protocol with respect to the anticipated conduct of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge or any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding the safety of imetelstat and partial or full clinical holds placed on the imetelstat IND by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or other regulatory developments related to imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe experimental nature of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any future collaborative arrangements for the development and potential commercialization of imetelstat that we may establish;\n\u2022\nthe demand in the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new commercial products, or clinical progress or lack thereof by us, potential future collaborative partners or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nincreased or continuing operating losses as a result of our sole responsibility for the development and potential future commercialization of imetelstat or otherwise;\n\u2022\ngeneral domestic and international market conditions or market conditions relating to the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning imetelstat proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ncomments by securities analysts or other third parties, including blogs, articles and other media;\n\u2022\nlarge stockholders exiting their position in our common stock or an increase in the short interest in our common stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of or developments concerning potential future litigation, including any securities class action litigation initiated as a result of the termination of the Collaboration Agreement;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of common stock to partners, vendors or investors to raise additional capital; and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of any other risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nStock prices and trading volumes for many biopharmaceutical companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons, including factors which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations, such as media coverage, statements made on message boards and social media forums, legislative and regulatory measures and the activities of various interest groups or organizations. In addition to the risk factors described in this section, overall market volatility, as well as general domestic or international economic, market and political conditions, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the return on your investment.\nIn addition, as further discussed in the Risk Factor above titled \u201cWe have been, and may in the future be, involved in securities-related legal actions that are expensive and time consuming. Any securities-related legal actions, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations\u201d, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies, including us, whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Any such litigation brought against us in the future could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and results of operations and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could result in further delays of potential future clinical trials or commercialization efforts.\nWe may fail to continue to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, and as a result our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on Nasdaq. In particular, Nasdaq rules require us to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share of our common stock. On December 21, 2018, the closing price of our common stock was $0.98 per share, and while the closing price of our common stock rose to $1.02 per share on December 26, 2018, and has subsequently remained at or above the minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share from December 26, 2018 through the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, it may in the future fall below the closing minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. If the closing bid price of our common stock were to fall below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, or we do not meet other listing requirements, we would fail to be in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards. There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the minimum bid price requirement, or any other requirement in the future. If we fail to meet the minimum bid price requirement, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC may initiate the delisting process with a notification letter. If we were to receive such a notification, we would be afforded a grace period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, shares of our common stock would need to maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders\u2019 equity or market values of our common stock, in which case our common stock could be delisted. If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had 300,000,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance and 186,392,682 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, we had reserved 40,665,152 shares of our common stock for future issuance pursuant to our option and equity incentive plans and outstanding warrants as of December 31, 2018. In addition, under the universal shelf registration statement filed by us in May 2018 and declared effective by the SEC in July 2018, we may sell any combination of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings, up to a cumulative value of $250 million.\nFuture sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur, or the issuance of common stock to fund our operations and imetelstat development, including pursuant to our 2018 Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR, could cause immediate dilution and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The sale or issuance of our securities, as well as the existence of outstanding options and shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our option and equity incentive plans and outstanding warrants, also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock and the return on your investment.\nOur undesignated preferred stock may inhibit potential acquisition bids; this may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors with the authority to issue up to 3,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imported upon these shares without further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if in the future, we issue preferred stock that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nProvisions in our charter, bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us, which may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they believe may be the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers.\nProvisions of our charter documents and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management, including provisions that:\n\u2022\nprevent stockholders from taking actions by written consent;\n\u2022\ndivide the board of directors into separate classes with terms of office that are structured to prevent all of the directors from being elected in any one year; and\n\u2022\nset forth procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders\u2019 meetings.\nProvisions of Delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations. In addition, we have individual severance agreements with our executive officers and a company-wide severance plan, either of which could require a potential acquirer to pay a higher price. Either collectively or individually, these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers, including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Our annual reports on Form 10-K must contain an annual assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must provide an opinion annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe requirements of Section 404 are ongoing and also apply to future years. We expect that our internal control over financial reporting will continue to evolve as our business develops. Although we are committed to continue to improve our internal control processes and we will continue to diligently and vigorously review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with Section 404 requirements, any control system, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Therefore, we cannot be certain that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered in the future. If material weaknesses or other significant deficiencies occur, such weaknesses or deficiencies could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS\nCompetitors may develop products, product candidates or technologies that are superior to or more cost-effective than ours, which may significantly impact the development and commercial viability of imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms related to imetelstat, the study of telomeres, telomerase, or our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry, and the research and development of therapies for the treatment of hematologic myeloid malignancies. In addition, other products and therapies that could directly compete with imetelstat currently exist or are being developed by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and by academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations.\nIf approved for commercial sale for the treatment of lower risk MDS, imetelstat would compete against a number of treatment options, including erythropoiesis stimulating agents and other hematopoietic growth factors; immunomodulators, such as lenalidomide by Celgene Corporation, or Celegene; hypomethylating agents, such as azacitidine by Celgene and decitabine by Janssen; in addition to investigational treatments that may be further along in development than imetelstat, such as oral versions of azacitidine; histone deacetylase inhibitors; TGF-beta superfamily inhibitors, such as luspatercept by Acceleron Pharma, Inc., or Acceleron, in collaboration with Celgene; PI3 Kinase inhibitors; proteasome inhibitors; aminopeptidase inhibitors, such as tosedostat by CTI Biopharma Corporation, or CTI Biopharma; TLR2-specific antibodies; TPO agonists, such as romiplostim by Amgen Inc.; anti-CD33 antibodies; anti-CD38 antibodies, such as daratumumab by Genmab A/S in collaboration with Janssen; anti-CD123 antibodies, such as talacotuzumab by Janssen; antagonists of Toll-like receptor signaling; retinoic acid receptor alpha agonists, such as SY-1425 by Syros Pharmaceuticals; hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, such as roxadustat by FibroGen, Inc.; Fas ligand inhibitors; immune checkpoint regulators; and JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors.\nIf approved for commercial sale for the treatment of MF, imetelstat would compete against Incyte Corporation\u2019s ruxolitinib, or Jakafi\u00ae, which is orally administered. In clinical trials, Jakafi\u00ae reduced spleen size, abdominal discomfort, early satiety, bone pain, night sweats and itching in MF patients. Recently, there have also been reports of overall survival benefit as well as improvement in bone marrow fibrosis from Jakafi\u00ae treatment. Other treatment modalities for MF include hydroxyurea for the management of splenomegaly, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and constitutional symptoms; splenectomy and splenic irradiation for the management of splenomegaly and co-existing cytopenias, or low blood cell counts; chemotherapy and pegylated interferon. Drugs for the treatment of MF-associated anemia include erythropoiesis stimulating agents, androgens, danazol, corticosteroids, thalidomide and lenalidomide. There are other investigational treatments for MF further along in development than imetelstat, such as pacritinib by CTI Biopharma, momelotinib by Sierra Oncology, and fedratinib by Celgene, which have reported results from Phase 3 clinical trials. Other investigational treatments for MF include inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathway, such as NS-018 by NS Pharma, Inc.; histone deacetylase inhibitors; interleukin-3 receptor targeted agents; inhibitors of heat shock protein 90; hypomethylating agents; PI3 Kinase and mTOR inhibitors; anti-fibrosis antibodies, such as PRM-151 from Promedior, Inc.; hedgehog and SMO inhibitors; PIM kinase inhibitors; IAP inhibitors; anti-LOX2 inhibitors; recombinant pentraxin 2 protein; KIP-1 activators; TGF-beta superfamily inhibitors, such as sotatercept and luspatercept by Acceleron, in collaboration with Celgene; FLT inhibitors; BET inhibitors, such as CPI-0610 by Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; SMAC mimetics, such as LCL161 by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\nSmaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies explore treatments for hematologic myeloid malignancies, which may significantly impact the commercial viability of imetelstat. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to imetelstat. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified development and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to the imetelstat program.\nIn addition to the above factors, imetelstat will face competition based on:\n\u2022\nproduct efficacy and safety;\n\u2022\nconvenience of product administration;\n\u2022\ncost of manufacturing;\n\u2022\nthe timing and scope of regulatory consents;\n\u2022\nstatus of coverage and level of reimbursement;\n\u2022\nprice; and\n\u2022\npatent position, including potentially dominant patent positions of others.\nAs a result of the foregoing, competitors may develop more commercially desirable or affordable products than imetelstat, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we may be able to achieve with imetelstat. Competitors have developed, or are in the process of developing, technologies that are, or in the future may be, competitive to imetelstat. Some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing therapeutic effects similar or superior to those that may be demonstrated by imetelstat. Competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, or less costly than imetelstat, or more convenient to administer to patients and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to imetelstat. In addition, competitors may price their products below what we may determine to be an acceptable price for imetelstat, may receive better third-party payor coverage and/or reimbursement, or may be more cost-effective than imetelstat. Such competitive products or activities by competitors may render imetelstat obsolete, which may cause us to cease any further development or future commercialization of imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nTo be commercially successful, imetelstat must be accepted by the health care community, which can be very slow to adopt or unreceptive to new technologies and products.\nIf approved for marketing, imetelstat may not achieve market acceptance since hospitals, physicians, patients or the medical community in general may decide not to accept and utilize imetelstat. If approved for commercial sale, imetelstat will compete with a number of conventional and widely accepted drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies. The degree of market acceptance of imetelstat will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which imetelstat is approved;\n\u2022\nthe country and/or regions within which imetelstat is approved;\n\u2022\nthe establishment and demonstration to the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe ability to demonstrate that imetelstat is superior to alternatives on the market at the time;\n\u2022\nthe ability to establish in the medical community the potential advantages of imetelstat over alternative treatment methods, including with respect to efficacy, safety, cost or route of administration;\n\u2022\nthe label and promotional claims allowed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for imetelstat, if any;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of imetelstat as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales, marketing and distribution support for imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe pricing of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by government and third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage by third-party payors, including governmental authorities.\nThe established use of conventional products competitive with imetelstat may limit or preclude the potential for imetelstat to receive market acceptance upon any commercialization. We may be unable to demonstrate any pharmacoeconomic advantage for imetelstat compared to established or standard-of-care therapies, or newly developed therapies, for hematologic myeloid malignancies. Third-party payors may decide that any potential improvement that imetelstat may provide to clinical outcomes in hematologic myeloid malignancies is not adequate to justify the costs of treatment with imetelstat. If the health care community does not accept imetelstat for any of the foregoing reasons, or for any other reason, our ability to further develop or commercialize imetelstat may be negatively impacted or precluded altogether, which would seriously and adversely affect our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIf acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for imetelstat is not obtained, the use of imetelstat could be severely limited.\nThe ability to successfully commercialize imetelstat will depend significantly on obtaining acceptable prices and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to the patient from third-party payors. Government payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and the reimbursement levels. Assuming we obtain coverage for imetelstat by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. If imetelstat is approved for commercial sale, patients are unlikely to use it unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of its cost. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement will be critical to new product acceptance.\nGovernment authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, such as by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices as a condition of coverage, are using restrictive formularies and preferred drug lists to leverage greater discounts in competitive classes, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of imetelstat to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nWe cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for imetelstat, if approved for commercial sale, and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. There may also be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which marketing approval is obtained. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize imetelstat, even if marketing approval is obtained, which would negatively impact our business and business prospects.\nThe adoption of health policy changes and health care reform in the United States may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, became law and substantially changed the way healthcare is funded by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions that may have a significant impact on our business.\nWhile the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of most elements of the ACA in June 2012 and upheld the ACA against challenges to nationwide tax subsidies in July 2015, other judicial and Congressional challenges against the ACA have been brought, and are likely to be brought in the future. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court\nlitigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, signed into law in January 2013, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nIn the future, we anticipate additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices, or the amounts of reimbursement available for imetelstat. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and federal and state legislative activity designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the price of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs, some of which are included in the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019. Additionally, the Trump administration released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On January 31, 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, will affect rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. While a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business and financial results. Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biologic product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payor or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on future worldwide sales of imetelstat, if approved.\nCost control initiatives also could decrease the price that we may receive for imetelstat in the future. If imetelstat is not considered cost-effective or adequate third-party reimbursement for the users of imetelstat cannot be obtained, then we may be unable to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in imetelstat. Any of these events would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIf we fail to comply with federal, state and foreign healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse, transparency, and health information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute any product of ours for which marketing approval is obtained. Such laws include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities, including prescription drug manufacturers (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, lease or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate, in order to commit a violation;\n\u2022\nthe federal civil and criminal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and its qui tam or whistleblower provisions which permit a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the government to enforce the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, or for providing medically unnecessary services or items. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information, upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, including the GDPR, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare, privacy and data security laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. For example, the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, provides an enforcement authority and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process or control compared to prior EU law, including in clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management\u2019s attention and increase our cost of doing business. Likewise, we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which has been characterized as the first \u201cGDPR-like\u201d privacy statute to be enacted in the United States because it mirrors a number of the key provisions in the GDPR, that will go into effect beginning January 1, 2020, and we cannot determine the impact such laws, regulations and standards will have on our business. In any event, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare or privacy laws, including the GDPR, in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations.\nFederal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other healthcare and privacy-related regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.", "PERMNO": 83756, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "GERN"}
