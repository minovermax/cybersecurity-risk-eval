{"cik": "76321", "company": "PARKER DRILLING CO /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur businesses involve a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this Form 10-K, including Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. While these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider, you should know that they are not the only risks or uncertainties facing us or which may adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDemand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for the majority of our services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry\u2019s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry\u2019s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines in oil and natural gas prices could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of recent decreases in oil and gas prices, many of our customers have announced reduced capital spending budgets for 2015, and further reductions in oil and gas prices or prices remaining at current levels for a prolonged period may result in further capital budget reductions.\nOil and natural gas prices impact demand for our services. Decreases in prices for crude oil and natural gas or other factors may reduce demand for our services and substantially reduce our profitability or result in losses.\nThe success of our operations is significantly dependent upon the exploration and development activities of the major, independent and national oil and natural gas E&P companies and large integrated service companies that comprise our customer base. Oil and natural gas prices and market expectations regarding potential changes in these prices can be extremely volatile. Increases or decreases in oil and natural gas prices and expectations of future prices could have an impact on our customers\u2019 long-term exploration and development activities, which in turn could materially affect our business and financial performance. Higher oil and gas prices do not necessarily result immediately in increased drilling activity because our customers\u2019 expectations of future oil and gas prices typically drive demand for our drilling services.\nOil and gas prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014. Downward pressure on oil and gas prices has continued in 2015 and may continue for the foreseeable future. Any prolonged reduction in oil and gas prices will depress immediate levels of exploration, development and production activity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOil and gas prices and demand for our services also depends upon numerous factors which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding future energy prices;\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development and production technology;\n\u2022\nthe adoption or repeal of laws and government regulations, both in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nthe imposition or lifting of economic sanctions against certain regions, persons and other entities;\n\u2022\nthe number of ongoing and recently completed rig construction projects which may create overcapacity;\n\u2022\nlocal and worldwide military, political and economic events, including events in the oil producing regions of Africa, the Middle East, Russia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia and Latin America;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to set and maintain production levels and prices;\n\u2022\nthe level of production by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nexpansion or contraction of worldwide economic activity, which affects levels of consumer and industrial demand;\n\u2022\nthe rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign tax policies;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe development and use of alternative energy sources; and\n\u2022\nthe policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves.\nA slowdown in economic activity may result in lower demand for our drilling and drilling related services and rental tools business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA slowdown in economic activity in the United States or abroad could lead to uncertainty in corporate credit availability and capital market access and could reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in lower crude oil and natural gas prices. Our business depends to a significant extent on the level of international onshore drilling activity and GOM inland and offshore drilling activity for oil and natural gas. Depressed oil and natural gas prices from lower demand as a result of slow or negative economic growth would reduce the level of exploration, development and production activity, all of which could cause our revenues and margins to decline, decrease dayrates and utilization of our rigs and use of our rental tools and limit our future growth prospects. Any significant decrease in dayrates or utilization of our rigs or use of our rental tools could materially reduce our revenue and profitability. In addition, current and potential customers who depend on financing for their drilling projects may be forced to curtail or delay projects and may also experience an inability to pay suppliers and service providers, including us. Likewise, economic conditions in the United States or abroad could impact our vendors\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to meet obligations to provide materials and services in general. All of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nRig upgrade, refurbishment and construction projects are subject to risks and uncertainties, including delays and cost overruns, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe regularly make significant expenditures in connection with upgrading and refurbishing our rig fleet. These activities include planned upgrades to maintain quality standards, routine maintenance and repairs, changes made at the request of customers, and changes made to comply with environmental or other regulations. Rig upgrade, refurbishment and construction projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project, including the following:\n\u2022shortages of equipment or skilled labor;\n\u2022unforeseen engineering problems;\n\u2022unanticipated change orders;\n\u2022work stoppages;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022unexpectedly long delivery times for manufactured rig components;\n\u2022unanticipated repairs to correct defects in construction not covered by warranty;\n\u2022failure or delay of third-party equipment vendors or service providers;\n\u2022unforeseen increases in the cost of equipment, labor or raw materials, particularly steel;\n\u2022disputes with customers, shipyards or suppliers;\n\u2022latent damages or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022financial or other difficulties with current customers at shipyards and suppliers;\n\u2022loss of revenue associated with downtime to remedy malfunctioning equipment not covered by warranty;\n\u2022unanticipated cost increases;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue and payments of liquidated damages for downtime to perform repairs associated with defects, unanticipated equipment refurbishment and delays in commencement of operations; and\n\u2022\nlack of ability to obtain the required permits or approvals, including import/export documentation.\nAny one of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Delays in the delivery of rigs being constructed or undergoing upgrade, refurbishment or repair may, in many cases, delay commencement of a drilling contract resulting in a loss of revenue to us, and may also cause our customer to renegotiate the drilling contract for the rig or terminate or shorten the term of the contract under applicable late delivery clauses, if any. If one of these contracts is terminated, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as favorable terms, if at all. Additionally, actual expenditures for required upgrades or to refurbish or construct rigs could exceed our planned capital expenditures, impairing our ability to service our debt obligations.\nFailure to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel could affect our operations.\nWe require skilled, trained and experienced personnel to provide our customers with the highest quality technical services and support for our drilling operations. We compete with other oilfield services businesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience we require. Competition for skilled labor and other labor required for our operations intensifies as the number of rigs activated or added to worldwide fleets or under construction increases, creating upward pressure on wages. In periods of high utilization, we have found it more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. A shortage in the available labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages. Increases in our operating costs could adversely affect our business and financial results. Moreover, the shortages of qualified personnel or the inability to obtain and retain qualified personnel could negatively affect the quality, safety and timeliness of our operations.\nOur debt levels and debt agreement restrictions may limit our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had:\n\u2022\n$615.0 million of long-term debt, including $10.0 million of current portion of long-term debt;\n\u2022\n$47.7 million of operating lease commitments; and\n\u2022\n$11.0 million of standby letters of credit.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations depends on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur negative cash flows from one or more segments of our operating activities. Our future cash flows from operating activities will be influenced by the demand for our drilling services, the utilization of our rigs, the dayrates that we receive for our rigs, demand for our rental tools, oil and gas prices, general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to service our debt obligations, we may have to take one or more of the following actions:\n\u2022\ndelay spending on capital projects, including maintenance projects and the acquisition or construction of additional rigs, rental tools and other assets;\n\u2022\nsell equity or assets; and\n\u2022\nrestructure or refinance our debt.\nAdditional indebtedness or equity financing may not be available to us in the future for the refinancing or repayment of existing indebtedness, or if available, such additional indebtedness or equity financing may not be available on a timely basis, or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations specified in our then existing debt instruments. In addition, in the event we decide to sell assets, we can provide no assurance as to the timing of any asset sales or the proceeds that could be realized from any such asset sale. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness is subject to certain market conditions and other factors which are beyond our control.\nIncreases in the level of our debt and restrictions in the covenants contained in the instruments governing our debt could have important consequences to you. For example, they could:\n\u2022\nresult in a reduction of our credit rating, which would make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities to the repayment of our debt and the interest associated with our debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt and creating liens on our properties;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have relatively less debt; and\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to downturns in our business.\nOur current operations and future growth may require significant additional capital, and the amount of our indebtedness could impair our ability to fund our capital requirements.\nOur business requires substantial capital. We may require additional capital in the event of growth opportunities, unanticipated maintenance requirements or significant departures from our current business plan.\nAdditional financing may not be available on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations contained in our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (2015 Secured Credit Agreement) and the indentures governing our outstanding 7.50% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.50% Notes) and 6.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (6.75% Notes, and collectively with the 7.50% Notes, the Senior Notes). Failure to obtain additional financing, should the need for it develop, could impair our ability to fund capital expenditure requirements and meet debt service requirements and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and the indentures for our Senior Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some actions.\nThe 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nmake investments and other restricted payments, including dividends;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nengage in sale leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nsell our assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies; and\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\nThese limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. Our 2015 Secured Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain ratios for consolidated leverage, asset coverage, consolidated interest coverage, and consolidated senior secured leverage. These covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue available business opportunities. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default with respect to the related indebtedness. If a default were to occur, the lenders under our 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and the holders of our Senior Notes could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. If the repayment of the indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness.\nCertain of our contracts are subject to cancellation by our customers without penalty and with little or no notice.\nCertain of our contracts are subject to cancellation by our customers without penalty and with relatively little or no notice. In some cases our customers may terminate without cause. When drilling market conditions are depressed, a customer may no longer need a rig or rental tools that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain comparable equipment at lower dayrates. Further, due to government actions, a customer may no longer be able to operate in, or it may not be economical to operate in, certain regions. As a result, customers may leverage their termination rights in an effort to renegotiate contract terms.\nOur customers may also seek to terminate contracts for cause, such as the loss of or a major damage to the drilling unit or other events that cause the suspension of drilling operations beyond a specified period of time. If we experience operational problems or if our equipment fails to function properly and cannot be repaired promptly, our customers will not be able to engage in drilling operations and may have the right to terminate the contracts. If equipment is not timely delivered to a customer or does not pass acceptance testing, a customer may in certain circumstances have the right to terminate the contract. The payment of a termination fee may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Early termination of a contract may result in a rig or other equipment being idle for an extended period of time. The likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness. The cancellation or renegotiation of a number of our contracts could materially reduce our revenue and profitability.\nWe rely on a small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer could adversely affect us.\nA substantial percentage of our revenues are generated from a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer could adversely affect us. In 2014, our largest customer, Exxon Neftegas Limited accounted for approximately 18.7 percent of our total revenues. Our drilling business depends on a limited number of key customers and the loss of any one or more key customers could have a material adverse effect on the business. Our consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers terminate their contracts with us, fail to renew our existing contracts or refuse to award new contracts to us.\nThe contract drilling and the rental tools businesses are highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition.\nThe contract drilling and rental tools markets are highly competitive and many of our competitors in both the contract drilling and rental tools businesses may possess greater financial resources than we do. Some of our competitors also are incorporated in countries that may provide them with significant tax advantages that are not available to us as a U.S. company and which may impair our ability to compete with them for many projects.\nContract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Many drilling and workover rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity, provided market conditions warrant, which may result in an oversupply of rigs in an area. Many competitors have constructed numerous rigs during periods of high energy prices and, consequently, the number of rigs available in some of the markets in which we operate has exceeded the demand for rigs for extended periods of time, resulting in intense price competition. Most drilling contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids, which also results in price competition. Historically, the drilling service industry has been highly cyclical, with periods of high demand, limited equipment supply and high dayrates often followed by periods of low demand, excess equipment supply and low dayrates. Periods of low demand and excess equipment supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in equipment being idle for long periods of time. During periods of decreased demand we typically experience significant reductions in dayrates and utilization. The Company, or its competition, may move rigs or other equipment from one geographic location to another location; the cost of which may be substantial. If we experience reductions in dayrates or if we cannot keep our equipment utilized, our financial performance will be adversely impacted. Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of our rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.\nOur international operations are subject to governmental regulation and other risks.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations. In 2014, we derived approximately 50.0 percent of our revenues from operations in countries other than the United States. Our international operations are subject to the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability, war, terrorism and civil disturbances;\n\u2022\neconomic sanctions imposed by the U.S. government against other countries, groups, or individuals, or economic sanctions imposed by other governments against the U.S. or businesses incorporated in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nlimitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage, in certain areas;\n\u2022\nexpropriation, confiscatory taxation and nationalization of our assets;\n\u2022\nforeign laws and governmental regulation, including inconsistencies and unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, and changes in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nincreases in governmental royalties;\n\u2022\nimport-export quotas or trade barriers;\n\u2022\nhiring and retaining skilled and experienced workers, some of whom are represented by foreign labor unions;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\ndamage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees, including kidnapping;\n\u2022\npiracy of vessels transporting our people or equipment;\n\u2022\nunfavorable changes in foreign monetary and tax policies;\n\u2022\nsolicitation by government officials for improper payments or other forms of corruption;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;\n\u2022\nrepudiation, nullification, modification or renegotiation of contracts; and\n\u2022\nother forms of governmental regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control.\nWe currently have operations in 23 countries. Our operations are subject to interruption, suspension and possible expropriation due to terrorism, war, civil disturbances, political and capital instability and similar events, and we have previously suffered loss of revenue and damage to equipment due to political violence. Civil and political disturbances in international locations may affect our operations. We may not be able to obtain insurance policies covering risks associated with these types of events, especially political violence coverage, and such policies may only be available with premiums that are not commercially reasonable.\nOur international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of countries with political, regulatory and judicial systems and regimes that may differ significantly from those in the U.S. Our ability to compete in international contract drilling and rental tool markets may be adversely affected by foreign governmental regulations and/or policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which nationals of those foreign countries have substantial ownership interests or by regulations requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Furthermore, our foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to us.\nIn addition, tax and other laws and regulations in some foreign countries are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities, which can result in disputes between us and governing authorities. The ultimate outcome of these disputes is never certain, and it is possible that the outcomes could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nA portion of the workers we employ in our international operations are members of labor unions or otherwise subject to collective bargaining. We may not be able to hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled and experienced workers for wages and other benefits that we believe are commercially reasonable.\nWe may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received or expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where we do not take protective measures against exposure to a foreign currency. We may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital. Given the international scope of our operations, we are exposed to risks of currency fluctuation and restrictions on currency repatriation. We attempt to limit the risks of currency fluctuation and restrictions on currency repatriation where possible by obtaining contracts payable in U.S. dollars or freely convertible foreign currency. In addition, some parties with which we do business could require that all or a portion of our revenues be paid in local currencies. Foreign currency fluctuations, therefore, could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the U.S., control the export and re-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities. The laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations can cause delays in shipments and unscheduled operational downtime. Moreover, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, could result in fines, criminal penalties, negative commercial consequences and an adverse effect on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing improper benefits for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. However, we operate in many parts of the world that experience corruption. If we are found to be liable for violations of these laws either due to our own acts or our omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others (including our joint ventures partners, our agents or other third party representatives), we could suffer from commercial, civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks associated with our business.\nWe ordinarily maintain insurance against certain losses and liabilities arising from our operations. However, we do not insure against all operational risks in the course of our business. Due to the high cost, high self-insured retention and limited coverage insurance for windstorms in the GOM we have elected not to purchase windstorm insurance for our inland barges in the GOM. Although we have retained the risk for physical loss or damage for these rigs arising from a named windstorm we have procured insurance coverage for removal of a wreck caused by a windstorm. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to hazards customary for drilling operations, which could adversely affect our financial performance if we are not adequately indemnified or insured.\nSubstantially all of our operations are subject to hazards that are customary for oil and natural gas drilling operations, including blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment defects, cratering, oil and natural gas well fires and explosions, natural disasters, pollution, mechanical failure and damage or loss during transportation. Some of our fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, damage from severe weather and marine life infestations. These hazards could result in damage to or destruction of drilling equipment, personal injury and property damage, suspension of operations or environmental damage, which could lead to claims by third parties or customers, suspension of operations and contract terminations. We have had accidents in the past due to some of these hazards. We may not be able to insure against these risks or to obtain indemnification to adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards and risks described above. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against or for which we are not indemnified, or the failure of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, insurance may not continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks. For example, pollution, reservoir damage and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Even if such insurance is available, insurance premiums or other costs may rise significantly in the future, making the cost of such insurance prohibitive. For a description of our indemnification obligations and insurance, see Item 1. Business - Insurance and Indemnification.\nCertain areas in and near the GOM are subject to hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions. When operating in and near the GOM, our drilling rigs and rental tools may be located in areas that could cause them to be susceptible to damage or total loss by these storms. In addition, damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas to our rigs, our shore bases and our corporate infrastructure could potentially cause us to curtail operations for significant periods of time until the effects of the damages can be repaired. In addition, our rigs in arctic regions can be affected by seasonal weather so severe, conditions are deemed too unsafe for operations.\nGovernment regulations may reduce our business opportunities and increase our operating costs.\nGovernment regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee privacy and safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, including species protections, prohibit access to some locations and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs, and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations, such as those related to climate change, may discourage our customers\u2019 activities, reducing demand for our products and services. We may be liable for damages resulting from pollution of offshore waters and, under United States regulations, must establish financial responsibility in order to drill offshore. See Item 1. Business - Environmental Considerations.\nRegulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.\nSome scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (GHGs) and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. In response to such studies, the issue of climate change and the effect of GHG emissions, in particular emissions from fossil fuels, is attracting increasing attention worldwide. Legislative and regulatory measures to address concerns that emissions of GHGs are contributing to climate change are in various phases of discussions or implementation at the international, national, regional and state levels.\nBecause our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or otherwise result in reduced economic activity generally. In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may have a negative impact on our business. In addition to potential impacts on our business directly or indirectly resulting from climate-change legislation or regulations, our business also could be negatively affected by climate-change related physical changes or changes in weather patterns. An increase in severe weather patterns could result in damages to or loss of our rigs, impact our ability to conduct our operations and/or result in a disruption of our customers\u2019 operations.\nWe are regularly involved in litigation, some of which may be material.\nWe are regularly involved in litigation, claims and disputes incidental to our business, which at times may involve claims for significant monetary amounts, some of which would not be covered by insurance. We undertake all reasonable steps to defend ourselves in such lawsuits. Nevertheless, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and any resolution which is adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of the material legal proceedings affecting us.\nA catastrophic event could occur, materially impacting our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur services are performed in harsh environments, and the work we perform can be dangerous. Catastrophic events such as a well blowout, fire, or explosion can occur, resulting in property damage, personal injury, death, pollution, and environmental damage. Typically, we are indemnified by our customers for injuries and property damage resulting from these types of events (except for injury to our employees and subcontractors and property damage to ours and our subcontractors\u2019 equipment). However, we could be exposed to significant loss if adequate indemnity provisions or insurance are not in place, if indemnity provisions are unenforceable or otherwise invalid, or if our customers are unable or unwilling to satisfy any indemnity obligations.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact the demand for rental tools.\nHydraulic fracturing is a process sometimes used in the completion of oil and natural gas wells whereby water, other liquids, sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil production. Various governmental entities (within and outside the United States) are in the process of studying, restricting, regulating, or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing, directly and indirectly. For example, many state governments now require the disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process. The U.S. EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing operations involving the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids are subject to permitting requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act; has adopted air emissions standards that apply to well completion activities; is developing new standards for wastewater discharges associated with hydraulic fracturing; and is conducting a study on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater. The Bureau of Land Management has also proposed regulations for hydraulic fracturing activities that would be unique to federal lands. In addition, some jurisdictions have imposed an express or de facto ban on hydraulic fracturing. These and other developments could cause operational delays or increased costs in exploration and production, which could adversely affect the demand for our rental tools.\nA cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers.\nIf our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss or damage of intellectual property, proprietary information, or customer data, having our business operations interrupted, and increased costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nOur acquisitions, dispositions, and investments may not result in the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, the generation of cash or income, or the reduction of risk, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions, including purchases or sales of assets, businesses, investments, or joint ventures.
