{"cik": "1109189", "company": "BASIC ENERGY SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the important factors that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in our forward-looking statements. We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business depends on domestic spending by the oil and natural gas industry, and this spending and our business has been in the past, and may in the future be, adversely affected by industry and financial market conditions that are beyond our control.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. Customers\u2019 expectations for lower market prices for oil and natural gas, as well as the availability of capital for operating and capital expenditures, may cause them to curtail spending, thereby reducing demand for our services and equipment.\nIndustry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity could adversely impact the level of drilling and workover activity by some of our customers. This reduction may cause a decline in the demand for our services or adversely affect the price of our services. In addition, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas also may have a negative long-term impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices, to the extent existing production is not replaced and the number of producing wells for us to service declines.\nDeterioration in the global economic environment commencing in the latter part of 2008 and continuing throughout 2009 caused the oilfield services industry to cycle into a downturn due to weakened demand. The industry returned to higher activity levels in 2011 and remained higher during the first half of 2012, before another downturn in the second half of 2012, affecting natural gas prices in particular. The industry pricing remained relatively stable through the middle of 2014. However, beginning in the second half of 2014, oil prices declined substantially from historical highs and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Adverse changes in capital markets and declines in prices for oil and natural gas will cause oil and natural gas producers to announce reductions in capital budgets for future periods. In light of the recent depressed oil prices, many oil producers, including many of our customers, have announced significant reductions in capital budgets for 2015.\nLimitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause oil and natural gas producers to make further reductions to capital budgets in the future even if oil or natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending will curtail drilling programs as well as discretionary spending on well services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge and our utilization. In addition, certain of our customers could become unable to pay their suppliers, including us. Any of these conditions or events could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, or if oil or natural gas prices remain low or decline further, the demand for our services could be adversely affected.\nThe demand for our services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related general production spending and level of drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells or lower production spending on existing wells. This, in turn, could result in lower demand for our services and may cause lower rates and lower utilization of our well service equipment. If oil prices or natural gas prices continue to remain low or decline further, or if there is a reduction in drilling activities, the demand for our services and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nPrices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. The Cushing WTI Spot Oil Price averaged $94.11, $97.91 and $ 93.26 per barrel in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Most recently, Cushing WTI oil prices have declined from over $107 per barrel in June 2014 to $59 per barrel on December 31, 2014. The Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price averaged $2.75, $3.73 and $4.39 per Mcf for 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.\nCompetition within the well services industry may adversely affect our ability to market our services.\nThe well services industry is highly competitive and fragmented and includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, as well as several large companies that possess substantially greater financial and other\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nresources than we do. Our larger competitors\u2019 greater resources could allow those competitors to compete more effectively than we can. The amount of equipment available may exceed demand, which could result in active price competition. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. In addition, adverse market conditions lower demand for well servicing equipment, which results in excess equipment and lower utilization rates. If adverse oil and natural gas market conditions persist or deteriorate further, our utilization rates may decline.\nWe may require additional capital in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash internally or obtain alternative sources of capital on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to fund capital expenditures, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to make substantial capital investments to purchase additional equipment to expand our services, refurbish our well servicing rigs and replace existing equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we invested approximately $236.3 million in cash for capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we invested approximately $137.0 million in cash for capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions. For 2015, we have currently budgeted $100.0 million for capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions. Historically, we have financed these investments through internally generated funds, debt and equity offerings, our capital lease program and borrowing under a senior credit facility. Please read \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for more information.\nOur significant capital investments require cash that we could otherwise apply to other business needs. However, if we do not incur these expenditures while our competitors make substantial fleet investments, our market share may decline and our business may be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash internally or obtain alternative sources of capital to fund our proposed capital expenditures and acquisitions, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders may result. Adverse changes in the capital markets could make it difficult to obtain additional capital or obtain it at attractive rates.\nOur future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges.\nWe have recorded goodwill impairment charges and asset impairment charges in the past. We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our property and equipment, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill for impairment. In performing these assessments, we project future cash flows on a discounted basis for goodwill, and on an undiscounted basis for other long-lived assets, and compare these cash flows to the carrying amount of the related assets. These cash flow projections are based on our current operating plans, estimates and judgmental assumptions. We perform the assessment of potential impairment on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually in the fourth quarter, or more often if events and circumstances warrant. We perform the assessment of potential impairment for our property and equipment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable due to various external or internal factors. If we determine that our estimates of future cash flows were inaccurate or our actual results are materially different from what we have predicted, we could record additional impairment charges in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have operated at a loss in the past, and there is no assurance of our profitability in the future.\nHistorically, we have experienced periods of low demand for our services and have incurred operating losses. In the future, we may not be able to reduce our costs, increase our revenues, or reduce our debt service obligations sufficient to achieve or maintain profitability and generate positive operating income. Under such circumstances, we may incur further operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow.\nOur operations are subject to inherent risks, including operational hazard and cyber attacks. These risks may be self-insured, or may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, blowouts, explosions, craterings, fires and oil spills. These conditions can cause:\n\u2022personal injury or loss of life;\n\u2022damage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment; and\n\u2022suspension of operations.\nThe occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the well services industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are being used may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nAs is customary in our industry, our service contracts generally provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our customers from any claims arising from personal injury or death of our employees, damage to or loss of our equipment, and pollution emanating\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfrom our equipment and services. Similarly, our customers agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from personal injury or death of their employees, damage to or loss of their equipment, and pollution caused from their equipment or the well reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir). Our indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case. For example, from time to time we may enter into contracts with less favorable indemnities or perform work without a contract that protects us. In addition, our indemnification rights may not fully protect us if the customer is insolvent or becomes bankrupt, does not maintain adequate insurance or otherwise does not possess sufficient resources to indemnify us. In addition, our indemnification rights may be held unenforceable in some jurisdictions. Our inability to fully realize the benefits of our contractual indemnification protections could result in significant liabilities and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are also subject to the risk of cyber-attacks. If our systems for protecting against cyber security risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss or damage of intellectual property, proprietary information, or customer data, having our business operations interrupted, and increased costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cyber security attacks. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe maintain insurance coverage that we believe to be customary in the industry against these hazards. However, we do not have insurance against all foreseeable risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. As such, not all of our property is insured. We are also self-insured up to retention limits with regard to workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, and medical and dental coverage. We maintain accruals in our consolidated balance sheets related to self-insurance retentions by using third-party data and historical claims history. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against, or the failure of an insurer to meet its insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, it may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could rise significantly in the future so as to make such insurance prohibitively expensive. It is likely that, in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles will be higher, and certain insurance coverage either will be unavailable or considerably more expensive than it has been in the recent past. In addition, our insurance is subject to coverage limits, and some policies exclude coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant liabilities for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or compliance.\nOur operations are subject to federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of natural resources and the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations and waste management, including the transportation and disposal of waste and other materials. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations on our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the incurrence of capital expenditures to mitigate or prevent releases of materials from our facilities, the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations and the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection. Regulations concerning equipment certification also create an ongoing need for regular maintenance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in investigations, restrictions or orders suspending well operations, the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the revocation of permits and the issuance of corrective action orders, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is inherent risk of environmental costs and liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and oilfield and industrial wastes, air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Our fluid services segment includes disposal operations into injection wells that pose risks of environmental liability, including leakage from the wells to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was without fault or lawful at the time it occurred or as a result of the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Clean-up costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and costs associated with changes in environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate as a motor carrier and therefore are subject to regulation by the DOT and by other various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety and hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. In addition, the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, require on board black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLaws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent over time and are expected to continue to do so, which could lead to material increases in costs for future environmental compliance and remediation. The modification or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could curtail exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and natural gas and could limit well servicing opportunities. We may not be able to recover some or any of our costs of compliance with these laws and regulations from insurance.\nPlease read \u201cBusiness and Properties - Environmental Regulation and Climate Change\u201d for more information on the environmental laws and government regulations that are applicable to us.\nWe may not be able to grow successfully through future acquisitions or successfully manage future growth, and we may not be able to effectively integrate the businesses we do acquire.\nOur business strategy includes growth through the acquisitions of other businesses. We may not be able to continue to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or successfully acquire identified targets. In addition, we may not be successful in integrating our current or future acquisitions into our existing operations, which may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or diminished financial performance or require a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s attention. Even if we are successful in integrating our current or future acquisitions into our existing operations, we may not derive the benefits, such as operational or administrative synergies, that we expected from such acquisitions, which may result in the commitment of our capital resources without the expected returns on such capital. Furthermore, competition for acquisition opportunities may escalate, increasing our cost of making further acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making additional acquisitions. We may also be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with or to fund future acquisitions under the Revolving Credit Facility and under the indentures governing our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019 and 7.75% Senior Notes due 2022.\nWhether we realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful.\nWe depend on several significant customers, and a loss of one or more significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur customers consist primarily of major and independent oil and gas companies. During 2014 and 2013, our top five customers accounted for 24% and 27%, respectively, of our revenues. However, no individual customer composed greater than 10% of our revenues. The loss of any one of our largest customers or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nIn most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers\u2019 cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nWe now have, and will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, our total debt was $931.1 million, including $1.2 million of premium, comprised of $475.0 million aggregate principal amount due under our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019, $300.0 million aggregate principal amount due under our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2022 and capital lease obligations in the aggregate amount of $138.9 million. There were $16.0 million in borrowings and $51.3 million of letters of credit outstanding under our $300.0 million revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we made cash interest payments totaling $61.9 million.\nOur current and future indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022impair our ability to make investments and obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business, our industry or the economy in general as a substantial portion of our operating cash flow will be required to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, making it more difficult to react to changes in our business and in industry and market conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing that may be necessary to operate or expand our business;\n\u2022put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to interest rate increases to the extent that we incur variable rate indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain the funds required to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in instruments governing any existing or future indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of such instruments. In the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed under those instruments to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest, secured lenders could foreclose on any of our assets securing their loans and we or one or more of our subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our indebtedness is accelerated, or we enter into bankruptcy, we may be unable to pay all of our indebtedness in full. Any of the foregoing consequences could restrict our ability to grow our business and cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019 and our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2022 impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019 and our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2022 each impose limitations on our ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u2022limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness;\n\u2022restrictions on mergers, sales or transfers of assets without the lenders\u2019 consent; and\n\u2022limitations on dividends and distributions.\nIn addition, our Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial conditions, some of which become more restrictive over time and may require us to reduce our debt or take some other action in order to comply with them. The failure to comply with any of these financial conditions, including the financial ratios or covenants, would cause a default under our Revolving Credit Facility. A default under any of our indebtedness, if not waived, could result in the acceleration of such indebtedness or other indebtedness, in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. In addition, a default or acceleration of any of our indebtedness under our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019, our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2022 or our Revolving Credit Facility could result in a default under or acceleration of other indebtedness with cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. In the event of any acceleration of our indebtedness, we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and any holders of secured indebtedness may seek to foreclose on the assets securing such indebtedness. Even if new financing is available, it may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us. These restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We also may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our Revolving Credit Facility or existing limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, including in connection with acquisitions. Please read \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Credit Facility\u201d for a discussion of our Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur industry has experienced a high rate of employee turnover. Any difficulty we experience replacing or adding personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to find enough skilled labor to meet our needs, which could limit our growth. Our business activity historically decreases or increases with the prices of oil and natural gas. We may have problems finding enough skilled and unskilled laborers in the future if the demand for our services increases. If we are not able to increase our service rates sufficiently to compensate for wage rate increases, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOther factors may also inhibit our ability to find enough workers to meet our employment needs. Our services require skilled workers who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of our industry volatility and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours. We believe that our success is dependent upon our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled technical personnel. Our inability to employ or retain skilled technical personnel generally could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur success depends on key members of our management, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of some of our executive officers. The loss of the services of T. M. \u201cRoe\u201d Patterson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, or other key personnel could disrupt our operations. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Patterson and our other executive officers that contain, among other provisions, non-compete agreements, we may not be able to enforce the non-compete provisions in the employment agreements.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAdverse weather conditions may affect our operations.\nOur operations may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. Severe weather, such as blizzards, extreme temperatures and hurricanes may cause evacuation of personnel, curtailment of services and suspension of operations, and loss of or damage to equipment and facilities. Damage from any adverse weather conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWeather conditions may also affect the price of crude oil and natural gas, and related demand for our services. Please read the risk factor above, \u201cIf oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, or if oil prices decline or natural gas prices remain low or decline further, the demand for our services could be adversely affected.\u201d\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting or regulating emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our field services.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases from industrial and energy sources contribute to increases of carbon dioxide levels in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans and contribute to global warming and other environmental effects, the EPA has adopted various regulations under the federal Clean Air Act addressing emissions of greenhouse gases that may affect the oil and gas industry. On August 16, 2012 the EPA published rules that include standards to reduce methane emissions associated with oil and gas production. Federal changes will affect state air permitting programs in states that administer the federal Clean Air Act under a delegation of authority, including states in which we have operations. Numerous legislative measures have been introduced in the past that would have imposed restrictions or costs on greenhouse gas emissions, including from the oil and gas industry. It is uncertain whether similar measures will be introduced in, or passed by, the new Congress which convened in January 2015. In addition, the United States has been involved in international negotiations regarding greenhouse gas reductions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Additionally, certain U.S. states or regional coalitions of states have adopted measures regulating or limiting greenhouse gases from certain sources or have adopted policies seeking to reduce overall emissions of greenhouse gases. The adoption and implementation of any international treaty or of any federal or state legislation or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to comply with such requirements and possibly require the reduction or limitation of emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations and other sources within the industrial or energy sectors. Such legislation or regulations could adversely affect demand for the production of oil and natural gas and thus reduce demand for the services we provide to oil and natural gas producers as well as increase our operating costs by requiring additional costs to operate and maintain equipment and facilities, install emissions controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes and fees relating to emissions, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases may produce changes in climate or weather, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, which if any such effects were to occur, could have adverse physical effects on our operations, physical assets and field services to exploration and production operators.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our well servicing activities and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe provide hydraulic fracturing and fluid handling services to our customers. Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injection of water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) provisions of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) to exclude certain hydraulic fracturing practices from the definition of \u201cunderground injection.\u201d The EPA has asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel and published proposed guidance relating to such practices in May 2012. In addition, repeal of the SDWA exclusion of hydraulic fracturing has been advocated by certain advocacy organizations and others in the public. Congress has considered bills to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the SDWA, which would have the effect of allowing the EPA to promulgate new regulations and permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing, and would require the disclosure of the chemical constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids to a regulatory agency, which would make the information public via the internet. At the state level, several states in which we operate have adopted regulations requiring the disclosure of certain information regarding hydraulic fracturing fluids.\nScrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, as the EPA commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and issued a progress report on December 21, 2012. The EPA is expected to release soon a draft assessment report for public comment and peer review. The U.S. Department of the Interior has also announced that it will consider regulations relating to the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques on public lands and disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents. On April 13, 2012, the Department of Interior, the Department of Energy and the EPA issued a memorandum outlining a multi-agency collaboration on unconventional oil and gas research in response to the White House \u201cBlueprint for a Secure Energy Future\u201d and the recommendations of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board Subcommittee on Natural Gas. Moreover, the EPA has announced that it will develop effluent limitations for the treatment of discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities with a proposed rule scheduled for publication in early 2015. In addition, some states and localities have adopted, and others\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nare considering adopting, regulations or ordinances that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, that would require, with some exceptions, disclosure of constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids, or that would impose higher taxes, fees or royalties on natural gas production. Recently, public concerns have been raised regarding the disposal of hydraulic fluid in injection wells. Partly in response to public concerns, the Texas Railroad Commission amended its existing oil and gas disposal well regulations to require seismic activity data in permit applications and provisions to authorize the imposition of certain limitations on existing wells if seismic activity increases in the area of an injection well, including a temporary injection ban. Moreover, public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production has been increasing, and has resulted in delays of well permits in some areas.\nIn 2010, a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives undertook investigations into hydraulic fracturing practices involving the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing fluids, including requesting information from various field services companies including us. We responded to that request and have received no further communication from the committee with regard to that investigation. However, on January 31, 2011, Representative Henry Waxman and other members of Congress wrote to the EPA asserting that various companies, including us, had engaged in hydraulic fracturing operations requiring a permit without obtaining such a permit. We have no knowledge as to whether or how the EPA will respond to that letter.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, incurred by our customers or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations or ordinances restricting or increasing the costs of hydraulic fracturing could potentially increase our costs of operations and cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our well servicing activities, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nPotential listing of species as \u201cendangered\u201d under the federal Endangered Species Act could result in increased costs and new operating restrictions or delays on our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers, which could adversely reduce the amount of contract drilling services that we provide to such customers.\nThe federal Endangered Species Act, referred to as the \u201cESA,\u201d and analogous state laws regulate a variety of activities, including oil and gas development, which could have an adverse effect on species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or their habitats. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause oil and natural gas exploration and production operators to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in affected areas, which impacts could adversely reduce the amount of drilling activities in affected areas, including support services that we provide to such operators under our contract drilling services segment. Numerous species have been listed or proposed for protected status in areas in which we provide or could in the future provide field services. For instance, the Sand Dune Lizard, referred to as \u201cLizard,\u201d a small lizard found in southeastern New Mexico and west Texas, an area where we provide a significant level of contract drilling services to oil and natural gas exploration and production operators, was proposed for listing as an endangered species under the ESA in December 2010 by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, also referred to as the \u201cFWS.\u201d In March 2014, the FWS listed the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Concurrently, the FWS finalized a special rule under Section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act that authorizes Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Colorado to continue managing conservation efforts related to oil and gas activities under the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies\u2019 range-wide conservation plan. The sage grouse and certain wildflower species, among others, are also species that have been or are being considered for protected status under the ESA and whose range can coincide with oil and natural gas production activities. The presence of protected species in areas where operators whom we provide contract drilling services conduct exploration and production operations could impair such operators\u2019 ability to timely complete well drilling and development and, consequently, adversely affect the amount of contract drilling or other field services that we provided to such operators, which reduction of services could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nOne of our directors may have a conflict of interest because he is also currently a managing partner of a private equity firm that makes investments in the energy sector. The resolution of any conflict of interest may not be in our or our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nSteven A. Webster, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, is the Co-Managing Partner of Avista Capital Holdings, L.P., a private equity firm that makes investments in the energy sector. This relationship may create a conflict of interest because of his responsibilities to Avista and its owners. His duties as a partner in, or director or officer of, Avista or its affiliates may conflict with his duties as a director of our company regarding corporate opportunities and other matters. The resolution of any such conflict may not always be in our or our stockholders\u2019 best interest.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022a classified board of directors, so that only approximately one third of our directors are elected each year;\n\u2022limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u2022advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.\nDelaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91040, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "BASX"}
