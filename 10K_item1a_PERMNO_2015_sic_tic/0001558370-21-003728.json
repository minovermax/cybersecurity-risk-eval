RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are undertaking a large number of business initiatives at the same time, including exploring opportunities to expand into new categories and complementary businesses. If these initiatives are not successful, they may have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe are undertaking a large number of new business initiatives at the same time in order to support our future growth. We have multiple growth initiatives and innovation in our development pipeline, including expanded merchandise assortments and new collections, additional galleries and guesthouses, new concepts and businesses, including through investment in joint ventures and acquisitions. We have developed and continue to refine and enhance our Design Gallery format, which involves larger store square footage. We also continue to add new product categories and to expand product assortments. For example, in fiscal 2019 we launched RH Beach House and RH Ski House. We will be introducing RH Contemporary, a new collection that bridges the gap between RH Interiors and RH Modern, while elevating our brand and expanding our market. We recently made various investments in real estate development projects that will support the first RH Ecosystem in Aspen, Colorado, which will include retail locations, hospitality concepts, residential properties, and workforce housing projects.\nWe can provide no assurances that customers will respond favorably to our new product offerings, Galleries or complementary businesses or that we will successfully execute on such business initiatives. Such new business opportunities may not achieve market acceptance or may only achieve market acceptance in limited geographic areas or at certain Design Galleries. In addition, developing and testing new and multiple business opportunities and strategies often requires knowledge in areas of expertise that may be new to our organization and may require significant time from our senior leadership team as well as substantial resources. We can provide no assurances that we will be successful in expanding our operations into any new businesses and product lines.\nAny new businesses we enter may also expose us to additional laws, regulations and risks, including the risk that we may incur ongoing operating expenses in such businesses in excess of revenues, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. The financial profile of any such new businesses may be different than our current financial profile, which could affect our financial performance and the market price for our common stock.\nWe have recently commenced an effort to expand our business internationally by establishing a new retail presence in global markets including Europe and the U.K. International expansion will expose us to new risks related to operating internationally, including, but not limited to, risks related to currency fluctuation, supply chain and product sourcing, new regulatory regimes applicable to our products, Galleries and employees, global health emergencies such as that related to the outbreak of COVID-19, and the consequences of international economic or political events including but not limited to the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union in January 2020, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d which has resulted in considerable change in the regulatory framework governing business in the U.K. and which may negatively impact the luxury market or our plans to operate in the U.K. We may be unsuccessful in adapting our operations to address such risks. We also may be unsuccessful in accurately selecting which international markets would support demand for our products or sizing our Gallery openings to such markets. We may determine to curtail and/or slow our international expansion initiative as part of our efforts to manage liquidity in response to overall market conditions and to address priorities in the different capital requirements of our business. Expanding our business internationally will also require that we develop operational expertise in new markets and regulatory regimes, and an inability to adapt our business quickly and efficiently to support our international expansion could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n12 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nIn fiscal 2015 we began to introduce an integrated hospitality experience, including Restaurants and wine bars, into a number of our new Gallery locations. As of January 30, 2021, ten of our Design Galleries included an integrated RH Hospitality experience and, based on the success of our hospitality offering to date, we plan to incorporate an integrated RH Hospitality offering, including Restaurants and wine bars, in many of the new Galleries that we open in the future. We continue to refine and develop the RH Hospitality model as we seek to optimize this part of our business and its integration with the operation of our Gallery locations. RH Hospitality is different from our traditional home furnishings business and involves evolving strategies that are untested and unproven and may expose us to a number of risks including risks related to the execution of food and hospitality operations in various locations where we operate retail locations. Although we have experienced a number of positive business outcomes from the RH Hospitality operations including the incremental revenue that we believe is driven in galleries with a hospitality offering, there can be no assurance that these benefits will be sustained or that we will avoid operational or other complications from the hospitality business. There can be no assurance that we will successfully scale RH Hospitality, that we will optimally balance the resources and square footage allocated to our hospitality offerings versus our product offerings at our Galleries, or that our hospitality offerings will be attractive to consumers in our market over a sustained period of time.\nWe often have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant costs for any new initiative before we realize any corresponding revenue with respect to such initiative. In addition, we may incur costs as we revise, restructure or discontinue existing product categories or business offerings in favor of pursuing new initiatives or retail concepts. For example, as we continue to open larger format Design Galleries in select major metropolitan markets, we expect to close a number of legacy Galleries and replace them with our Design Gallery format. The introduction of an integrated hospitality experience, including roll out of an integrated food and beverage experience at a new Gallery location often requires significant investments by us before the location is open to customers and able to generate revenues, and we anticipate that a number of Galleries to be opened during the next several years will continue to require this form of upfront investment before they generate revenue from the food and beverage offerings. To the extent that these new business opportunities do not generate sufficient revenue to recoup the cost of developing and operating such new concepts, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we are continuing a number of new initiatives to improve the operations of our business, including ongoing refinements to our organizational structure. Some of the improvements we are pursuing include changing the ways we source and deliver our products to our customers, as well as streamlining and realigning the senior leadership and personnel structure in our home office operations. We have also focused on elevating the customer experience, which includes improving our distribution and delivery of products to our customers and architecting a new fully integrated back-end operating platform, inclusive of the supply chain network, the home delivery experience as well as a new metric-driven quality system and company-wide decision data. We have focused on rationalizing our SKU count and optimizing inventory, which includes selling slower moving, discontinued and other inventory through markdowns and our outlet channel, as well as enhancing and optimizing our product sourcing capabilities and adding new management information systems.\nIf we are not successful in managing the large number of new initiatives that are underway, we might experience an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Given the large number of organizational initiatives we are pursuing, as well as the complexity and untested nature of many of these efforts, there can be no certainty that we will be successful in executing on these initiatives including changes to our organizational structure. We may not experience the operational or financial benefits we expect these improvements to generate and we may face unanticipated costs related to pursuing these initiatives such as personnel turnover, senior leadership distraction, or compliance and quality control risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAll of the foregoing risks may be compounded due to various factors including the rapidly changing macroeconomic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or any economic downturn. If we fail to achieve the intended results of our current business initiatives, or if the implementation of these initiatives is delayed or abandoned, diverts our leadership team\u2019s attention or resources from other aspects of our business or costs more than anticipated (including, as a result of personnel turnover or compliance and control risks), we may experience inadequate return on investment for some or all such business initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 13\nWe have experienced significant fluctuations in the growth rate of our business during the last several years, and high levels of growth may not be achieved in future periods and may not generate a corresponding improvement in our results of operations.\nWe have experienced significant fluctuations in the growth rate of our business during the last several years including within the quarters during fiscal 2020. We may continue to experience wide fluctuations in our quarterly revenue and financial performance. Our quarterly results during fiscal 2020 were affected by a variety of factors related to the overall operating environment including the impact of the pandemic on various parts of our operations. We are currently engaged in a number of initiatives to support the growth and transformation of our business, including investments to elevate our brand and make a number of improvements to our products and the customer experience, inclusive of architecting a new fully integrated back-end operating platform, improving our supply chain network, enhancing our home delivery experience and developing a metric-driven quality system and enhanced integration of data to drive our business operations. While we anticipate that these initiatives will support the growth of our business as well as improvements to our financial results, the costs and timing issues associated with pursuing these initiatives can negatively affect our gross margins in the short term and may amplify fluctuations in our growth rate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing and extent of our realization of the costs and benefits of these and other initiatives.\nThere can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that we will not encounter other operational difficulties that may have a material negative impact on growth and profitability. In addition, these initiatives may have near-term material negative impacts on growth and profitability as we incur costs or pursue strategies that may not contribute to our profits and margins until future periods, if at all. In fiscal 2020, our efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic drove a number of changes in our quarterly revenue and financial performance. Although global economic conditions appear to be returning to normal with the widespread availability of the vaccine in the United States, there remain substantial disruptions in the global supply chain that are likely to take time to resolve and these may result in a continuation of delays in the availability of merchandise and longer than normal lead times for fulfillment of customer orders. In addition, the return of consumer spending patterns in place prior to the pandemic may result in a shift in consumer spending away from home furnishings toward the consumption of services including entertainment and travel. Any of these factors may directly or indirectly affect our quarterly results during fiscal 2021 or over a longer timeframe.\nSome factors affecting our business, including macroeconomic conditions and policies and changes in legislation, are not within our control. In prior periods, our results of operations have been adversely affected by weakness in the overall economic environment such as the initial periods of significant economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as slowdowns in the housing market. Our business depends on consumer demand for our products and, consequently, is sensitive to a number of factors that influence consumer spending, including, among other things, the general state of the economy, capital and credit markets, consumer confidence, general business conditions, the availability and cost of consumer credit, the level of consumer debt, interest rates, level of taxes affecting consumers, housing prices, new construction and other activity in the housing sector and the state of the mortgage industry and other aspects of consumer credit tied to housing, including the availability and pricing of mortgage refinancing and home equity lines of credit.\nIn particular, our business performance is linked to the overall strength of luxury consumer spending in markets in which we operate. Economic conditions affecting selected markets in which we operate are expected to have an impact on the strength of our business in those local markets, including with respect to the volatility in consumer demand and sentiment as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. Our business trends are frequently correlated closely with conditions in financial markets including the stock market. The global economic environment is currently in a period of widespread uncertainty as governments and central banks continue to respond to the impact of COVID-19 on business conditions. In the event that equity and credit markets experience volatility and disruption, customer demand for our product and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\n14 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nIn addition, our rates of revenue growth have sharply fluctuated from quarter to quarter over the last three years and we expect volatility in the rates of our growth to continue in future quarterly periods. Unique factors in any given quarter may affect period-to-period comparisons in our revenue growth, including:\nthe overall economic and general retail sales environment, including the effects of uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic or its related impacts on consumer spending;\nthe availability of our products and the impact of delays or disruption in our supply chain;\nconsumer preferences and demand;\nthe number, size and location of stores we open, close, remodel or expand in any period;\nchanges in Source Book circulation, and the number of pages in our Source Books and timing of mailing;\nour ability to efficiently source and distribute products;\nchanges in our product offerings and the introduction, and timing thereof, of introduction of new products and new product categories;\npromotional events;\nour competitors introducing similar products or merchandise formats;\nthe timing of various holidays, including holidays with potentially heavy retail impact; and\nthe success of our marketing programs.\nDue to these factors, our results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year. Our results of operations may also vary relative to corresponding periods in prior years. We may take certain pricing, merchandising or marketing actions that could have a disproportionate effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in a particular quarter or selling season, and as a result we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.\nOther future developments in our business could also result in material changes in our operating costs, including increased merchandise inventory costs and costs for paper and postage associated with the mailing and shipping of Source Books. For example, in recent periods, we have experienced increased shipping costs and raw material costs for our products. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in offsetting any such expenses with increased efficiency or that cost increases associated with our business will not have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic poses significant and widespread risks to our business as well as to the business environment and the markets in which we operate.\nThe global outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) and resulting health crisis continues to have a widespread impact on our customers, our business environment, the economic climate in the U.S. and globally, and financial and consumer markets. The COVID-19 outbreak in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 caused disruption to our business operations, as we temporarily closed all of our retail locations and restaurants. As of March 24, 2021 we had reopened all of our Galleries and Outlets, and nine out of ten of our Restaurants. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and continuing into the first quarter of 2021, there have been continuous changes in operational restrictions with respect to our Galleries and hospitality locations based upon local conditions, and we have experienced further closings, reopenings and new or re-imposed restrictions on our operating activities. Depending on the future course of the pandemic, including potential further outbreaks with new strains or variants of the virus, we may experience further restrictions on and closures of our physical operations with respect to Galleries, Outlets and Restaurants. For example, various parts of both the U.S. and Canada experienced an increase in reported COVID-19 cases in the fourth quarter of 2020. Although we have experienced strong demand for our products in connection with prior closure requirements earlier in calendar year 2020, our overall demand in specific markets correlates favorably with our customers\u2019 ability to access our Galleries and Outlets. The changing state and federal requirements have required and may in the future require further changes in our business practices in order to remain compliant. Accordingly, we do anticipate some ongoing negative impact to overall demand in connection the restrictions on our physical locations and the duration and extent of these operational limits cannot be predicted with certainty.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 15\nWhile we have continued to serve our customers and operate our business through the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis, there can be no assurance that future events will not have an impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition since the extent and duration of the health crisis remains uncertain. Future adverse developments in connection with the COVID-19 crisis, including additional waves or resurgences of COVID-19 outbreaks, including with regard to new strains or variants of the virus, evolving international, federal, state and local restrictions and safety regulations in response to COVID-19 risks, changes in consumer behavior and health concerns, the pace of economic activity in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, or other similar issues could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition in the future, or our financial results and business performance in future periods. Although the increasing availability of vaccines and various treatments with respect to COVID-19 can be expected to have an overall positive impact on business conditions in the aggregate over time, there remain uncertainties as to the logistics of distribution and the overall efficacy of any vaccine program, including with regard to new strains or variants of the virus, and there can be no assurances regarding the exact timing of these positive developments or the related impact on the economic recovery.\nVolatility in consumer demand and sentiment as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve can also expose us to risks in our operations. In our immediate response to COVID-19, we aggressively scaled back some inventory orders while we assessed the status of our business. While our business strengthened during the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, the lag in manufacturing and inventory receipts together with dislocations in our supply chain has resulted in some delays in our ability to convert business demand into revenues and we anticipate that our supply chain may not catch up to demand until the second half of fiscal 2021. In addition, our near term decisions regarding the sources and uses of capital in our business will continue to reflect and adapt to changes in market conditions and our business related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The global scale and scope of the pandemic remains unknown and the duration and extent of future business disruption is uncertain. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including developing information concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by governments and private businesses to attempt to contain COVID-19.\nWe may face operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving international, federal, state and local restrictions, standards and safety regulations. Public health officials and other governmental authorities have adopted numerous mitigation measures to address the spread of the virus, and in particular to discourage people from congregating in public, commercial or private spaces. During the course of the pandemic, federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and Canada have implemented a number of different directives that may require changes in our business practices. The scope and duration of these directives is evolving and not entirely clear. In response to current or future COVID-19 outbreaks or other concerns, states and municipalities in the U.S. where we operate may implement or reinstate temporary closure requirements with respect to non-essential business operations and the duration of these requirements is unknown. For example, in most of our retail locations that had reopened at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2020, the substantial operational restrictions related to COVID-19 health and safety considerations, such as limits to seating capacity, that were imposed on our hospitality business by various governmental authorities remained in place during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 and the first fiscal quarter of 2021. Many of our Galleries are located in malls or otherwise located in proximity to a number of other retail stores. Mall operators and other retailers have imposed, and may continue to impose, additional health and safety practices and procedures and may in the future elect to temporarily cease operations in response to renewed or localized outbreaks.\nIn addition, new regulation or requirements that governmental authorities may impose with respect to the compensation of our employees or the manner or location in which our employees may work, could also have an adverse effect on our business. At various times since the beginning of the pandemic, substantially all of our personnel, including those in our corporate office in Corte Madera, California, have been subject to state and local shelter-in-place requirements, which have varied over time and which have resulted in most of our team being required to work remotely. These working arrangements as well as other related restrictions including severe limitations on travel may have an impact on our operations and the ability of our executives to lead our teams. Although we have technology and other resources to support these new work requirements, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material risks to our business, operations, productivity and results of operations as a result of these restrictions. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our operations may be negatively impacted, potentially materially adversely affecting our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\n16 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nThe evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world may continue to have an adverse impact on elements of our supply chain including the manufacture, supply, distribution, transportation and delivery of our products and our inventory levels. There have been substantial disruptions that have already occurred with respect to the global supply chain as a result of the pandemic. Our business depends on the successful operation of a global supply chain. Based on total dollar volume of purchases for fiscal 2020, approximately 72% of our products were sourced from Asia, with 35% sourced from China, 15% from the U.S. and the remainder from other countries and source regions. The presence of the virus and the response to the health crisis in various countries is likely to have a continuing impact on our supply chain, for example by affecting the speed at which the factories that manufacture our products are able to resume normal operations and production levels after initial or subsequent waves of closures, and the extent that the health crisis may abate in particular countries is uncertain.\nSince the second fiscal quarter of 2020, we have resumed many investments and previously deferred expenditures, but we anticipate that our decisions regarding these matters will continue to evolve in response to changing business circumstances including further developments with respect to the pandemic. For example, real estate development counterparties with respect to some of our Gallery development projects have withdrawn from these projects as a result of capital or liquidity constraints due to COVID-19 related difficulties, and these and other similar factors may impact the timing or scope of some of our new Galleries. We have recently commenced an effort to expand our business internationally by establishing a new retail presence in global markets including the United Kingdom and various locations in continental Europe. The ongoing global impact of COVID-19, including travel restrictions imposed by various countries, may continue to affect certain aspects of our planned international expansion and has been a major factor in our decision to delay the timing of our previous plans to open a number of our international locations. In addition, we are in the process of developing a number of new Gallery locations in the U.S. and we are modifying a number of these plans based upon the right real estate development strategy including the selection of appropriate counterparties in markets where our prior strategy or plans are no longer applicable. Adverse developments with counterparties for some of our Gallery development projects may impact the timing or scope of some of our development projects. In addition, our RH Guesthouse initiative may be negatively impacted by the disease outbreak as international, federal, state and local governments have restricted travel, conferences, events and gatherings. Any of these negative developments could cause us to decide to curtail and/or further postpone business investments including those related to opening new Galleries in the U.S. as well as other initiatives including our international expansion.\nOur business also depends on a number of third parties including vendors, landlords, lenders and other suppliers. One or more of these third parties may experience financial distress, staffing shortages or liquidity challenges, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and resulting macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of third parties that are essential to our business operations and we may incur losses and other negative impacts for difficulties experienced by our vendors and other third parties.\nChanges in consumer spending and factors that influence spending of the specific categories of consumers that purchase from us, including the health of the high-end housing market, may significantly impact our revenue and results of operations.\nWe target consumers of high-end home furnishings as customers for our products. As a result, we believe that our sales are sensitive to a number of factors that influence consumer spending generally, but are particularly affected by the financial health of the higher end customer and demand levels from that customer demographic. In addition, not all macroeconomic factors are highly correlated in their impact on lower end housing versus the higher end customer. Demand for lower priced homes and first time home buying may be influenced by factors such as employment levels, interest rates, demographics of new household formation and the affordability of homes for the first time home buyer. The higher end of the housing market may be disproportionately influenced by other factors including the number of foreign buyers in higher end real estate markets in the U.S., the number of second and third homes being sold, stock market volatility and illiquid market conditions, global economic uncertainty, decreased availability of income tax deductions for mortgage interest and state income and property taxes, and the perceived prospect for capital appreciation in higher end real estate. Shifts in consumption patterns linked to the reopening of businesses in light of improvements relating to the COVID-19 pandemic may also have an impact on consumer spending in the high-end housing market. Further, in recent periods the stock market has experienced significant volatility as well as periods of significant decline, and rising house prices have dampened and increases in interest rates may dampen growth in the U.S. housing market and may depress consumer optimism about the U.S. housing market and home buying in the higher end of the housing market. We have determined that our customer purchasing patterns are influenced by economic factors including the health and volatility of the stock market. We have seen that previous declines in the stock market and periods of high volatility have been correlated with a reduction in consumer demands for our products.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 17\nThere can be no assurance that some of the other macroeconomic factors described above will not adversely affect the higher end consumer that we believe makes up the bulk of our customer demand. We believe that a number of these factors have in the past had, and may in the future have, an adverse impact on the high-end retail home furnishings sector and affect our business and results. These factors may make it difficult for us to accurately predict our operating and financial results for future periods and some of these factors could contribute to a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to successfully and timely deliver merchandise to our customers and manage our supply chain commensurate with demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe must successfully manage our supply chain and vendors in order to produce sufficient quantities of products that our customers wish to purchase in a timely manner. We must manage our supply chain and inventory levels, including predicting the appropriate levels and type of inventory to stock within each of our distribution centers, such that our \u201cin stock\u201d position in merchandise correlate well to consumer demand and expected delivery times. Because much of our merchandise requires that we provide vendors with significant ordering lead times, frequently before market factors are known, we may not be able to source sufficient inventory to meet demand if our products prove more popular than anticipated. In addition, our current initiatives to streamline and optimize our inventory levels may not be successful and implementing such initiatives may complicate our efforts to manage our supply chain. To the extent our business initiatives result in new product lines, new product or service offerings or further expand into new markets in the U.S. or abroad, we may need to establish new vendor relationships or new supply chain operations, which may expose us to new counterparty, regulatory, market or other risks and which may not be successful. We have experienced periods in which some of our vendors were not able to meet customer demand levels for certain products resulting in significant back orders for goods, higher rates of cancellation on orders in process and, in some instances, the loss of customer sales when orders could not be completed in a timely manner. During fiscal 2020, we experienced substantial increases in delays in customer orders as a result of disruption in the global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These conditions are likely to persist to some extent during fiscal 2021 and there can be no assurance how long it will take for conditions to return to normal. In addition, vulnerabilities in the information systems of our vendors could make our vendors the targets of cybersecurity breaches or cyber fraud, which could result in disruptions in our supply chain and product sourcing. Further, the seasonal nature of some of our products requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory prior to certain selling seasons. If we are unable to accurately predict and track demand, we may be required to mark down the price of certain products in order to sell excess inventory or we may be required to sell such inventory through our outlet stores or warehouse sales. If the dislocations in our supply chain do not recover as quickly as we anticipate, we may be delayed in our ability to convert business demand into revenues. For these reasons, our results of operations in any given quarterly period may be adversely affected. We expect these factors to continue from time to time as we add new product assortments and new merchandise categories into our business.\n18 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nMerchandise purchased from our vendors that is defective or otherwise does not meet our product quality standards could damage our reputation and brand image and harm our business, and we may not have adequate remedies against our vendors for such merchandise.\nSome of our merchandise has failed to meet our expectations and objectives concerning quality. Our emphasis in merchandise quality is increasing as we strive to elevate our brand. We have in recent periods, and may in the future, recalled products from the market due to quality or other issues. Despite our ongoing efforts to improve customers\u2019 satisfaction with their experience at RH, we may fail to maintain the necessary level of quality for some of our products in order to satisfy our customers. For example, our vendors may not be able to continuously adhere to our quality control standards, and we might not identify a quality deficiency before merchandise ships to our stores or customers. Our failure to supply high quality merchandise in a timely and effective manner to our customers, our announcement of additional product recalls, or any perception that we are not adequately maintaining our sourcing and quality control processes in order to anticipate product quality issues could damage our reputation and brand image, and could lead to an increase in product returns or exchanges or customer litigation against us and a corresponding increase in our routine and non-routine litigation costs. Further, any merchandise that does not meet our quality standards or applicable government requirements could trigger high rates of customer complaints or returns, become subject to a product recall and/or attract negative publicity, which could in turn damage our reputation and brand image, result in consumer litigation (including class-action lawsuits), and harm our business. With the growth in importance and the impact of social media, the magnitude of such harm to our business, reputation and brand image may be significantly amplified. We are making changes in many aspects of our business processes that affect our customers, including improvements in product quality and enhancements in sourcing, product availability, which are expected to include increasingly significant operational and other changes in the near term, may complicate our supply chain and quality control process, and any inability to invest sufficient resources in quality control and compliance processes or significant turnover in the personnel dedicated to such function may result in quality control issues or product recalls.\nEven if we detect that merchandise is defective or otherwise not in compliance with our product quality standards before such merchandise is shipped to our customers, we may not be able to return such products to the vendor, obtain a refund of our purchase price from the vendor or obtain other indemnification from the vendor. The limited capacities of certain of our vendors may constrain the ability of such vendors to replace any defective merchandise in a timely manner. Similarly, the limited capitalization and liquidity of certain of our vendors and their lack of insurance coverage for product recall claims may result in such vendors being unable to refund our purchase price or pay applicable penalties or damages associated with any such defects or resulting product recalls.\nIf we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand or market our product offerings, we may be unable to attract a sufficient number of customers or sell sufficient quantities of our products.\nOur business depends in part on a strong brand image, and we continue to invest in the development of our brand and the marketing of our business. We believe that the brand image we have developed, and the lifestyle image associated with our brand, have contributed significantly to the success of our business to date. Our increased focus on elevating RH as a luxury brand further increases the importance of our brand image, position and reputation. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is integral to the future of our business and to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. This will require us to continue to make investments in areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as the day-to-day investments required for store operations, Source Book mailings, website operations and employee training. Our brand image may be diminished if new products, services or other businesses fail to maintain or enhance our distinctive brand image.\nAdditionally, our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise and service quality. With the growth in importance and the impact of social media, any negative publicity from product defects, recalls or failures in service may be magnified and reach a large portion of our customer base in a very short period of time, which could harm the value of our brand and, consequently, our financial performance could suffer. We may also suffer reputational harm if we fail to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities, if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations or if we experience other negative events that affect our image or reputation. Any failure to maintain a strong brand image could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 19\nOur failure to successfully manage the strategy and costs of promoting our brand and products could have a negative impact on our business.\nAs a luxury brand, we rely on a number of initiatives to sustain our image and to promote our products in the marketplace. Our physical retailing presence, primarily in the form of our galleries, is one of the most important initiatives that we use to display our product offering. We also our website and other digital efforts, as well as our Source Books, to showcase a larger portion of our assortment. We continue to adjust and refine our strategy, including our digital initiatives and mailings, based on a variety of factors, including the success of the various changes that we adopt. During fiscal 2020, we increased our investment in certain digital initiatives and we expect to continue some of these investments. We can provide no assurances as to the success of any strategy we pursue as we seek to communicate with consumers, including by increased investment in digital initiatives.\nExpenditures on our catalog strategy may result in the production of too many Source Books, which could negatively affect our operating margins. Reducing expenditures on our catalog strategy, however, could overly restrict catalog circulation and have a negative effect on our revenues. Our efforts to optimize our Source Books and strategies for use of the Source Books to market our business may encounter difficulties. There can be no assurance that we will be successful as we make changes to our Source Book strategy including with respect to the cadence and timing of mailings, the format of the Source Books, the team we staff for optimizing our Source Book format and mailings, and the use of the Source Books as a marketing and promotional tool including with respect to prospecting for new customers. If we fail to adequately adjust our catalog strategy to meet our goals, or if our catalog strategy is unsuccessful, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. We also rely on customary discounts from the basic shipping rate structure that are available for our catalog mailings, which could be changed or discontinued at any time, and we are subject to fluctuations in the market price for paper, which has historically fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Future increases in shipping rates, paper costs or printing costs would have a negative impact on our results of operations to the extent that we are unable to offset such increases through increased sales or by raising prices, by implementing more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems, or by using alternative direct-mail formats.\nWe have historically experienced fluctuations in customer response to our Source Books. Customer response depends substantially on product assortment, product availability and creative presentation, the selection of customers to whom the catalogs are mailed, changes in mailing strategies, page size, page count, frequency and timing of delivery of catalogs, as well as the general retail sales environment and current domestic and global economic conditions. The failure to effectively produce or distribute our catalogs could affect the timing of catalog delivery. The timing of catalog delivery has in the past been, and in the future can be, affected by shipping service delays. Any delays in the timing of catalog delivery could cause customers to forgo or defer purchases. If the performance of our catalogs declines, if we misjudge the correlation between our catalog circulation and net revenues, or if our catalog circulation optimization strategy is not successful, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nCompetition in the home furnishings sector may adversely affect our future financial performance.\nThe home furnishings sector is highly competitive. We compete with the interior design trade and specialty stores, as well as antique dealers and other merchants that provide unique items and custom-designed product offerings at higher price points. We also compete with national and regional home furnishing retailers and department stores. In addition, we compete with mail order catalogs and online retailers focused on home furnishings. There are an increasing number of online and digital centric business models in the home furnishings sector and the impact of these competitors on other home furnishing businesses is uncertain although some of these digital offerings have gained market share primarily in areas outside the luxury end of the market.\n20 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nWe compete generally with these other retailers for customers, suitable retail locations, vendors, qualified employees and senior leadership personnel. As we have traditionally been a leader in the home furnishings sector, some of our competitors have also attempted to imitate our product offerings and business initiatives from time to time in the past. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do and therefore may be able to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. Such competitors may also be able to adapt to changes in customer preferences more quickly than we can due to their greater financial or marketing resources, through new product launches or by adapting their business models and operations to new customer trends, which may in turn change how our customers acquire products or view our business and brand. Further, increased catalog mailings by our competitors may adversely affect response rates to our own Source Book mailings. There can be no assurance that such competitors will not be more successful than us, based on imitation or otherwise, or that we will be able to continue to maintain a leadership position in style and innovation in the future.\nIncreased competition also has resulted, and may in the future result, in potential or actual litigation between us and our competitors related to a variety of activities, including hiring practices. If we are not successful in such litigation, our business could be harmed.\nIf we fail to successfully anticipate consumer preferences and demand our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are vulnerable to customer preferences and demand. Our success depends in large part on our ability to originate and define home product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a range of consumers whose preferences cannot always be predicted with certainty. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop products that customers positively respond to or that we will successfully meet consumer demands in the future. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify or respond effectively to consumer preferences and demand could adversely affect sales of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our dependence on foreign manufacturing and imports for our merchandise.\nBased on total dollar volume of purchases for fiscal 2020, approximately 72% of our products were sourced from Asia, 15% from the U.S. and the remainder from other countries and regions. For fiscal 2020, approximately 35% of our products were sourced from China. We expect the amount of products that we source from China will be lower in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, but the exact product mix in terms of vendor factory locations is subject to a range of different factors and is inherently difficult to predict with accuracy. In addition, some of the merchandise we purchase from vendors in the U.S. also depends, in whole or in part, on vendors located outside the U.S. As a result, our business highly depends on global trade, as well as any trade and or other factors that impact the specific countries where our vendors\u2019 production facilities are located. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain our existing foreign vendor relationships and to develop new ones based on the requirements of our business and any changes in trade dynamics that might dictate changes in the locations for sourcing of products. In addition, we face risks related to the ability of our vendors to scale their operations whether in connection with new products we introduce or new production manufacturing locations that may be added to our supply chain, which in some cases would require substantial ongoing investments to support additional capacity. In addition, we have previously encountered difficulties in the ability of our vendors to scale production commensurate with demand from our customers. While we rely on long-term relationships with many of our vendors, we do not rely on long-term contracts with our vendors and generally transact business with them on an order-by-order basis.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 21\nMany of our imported products are subject to existing duties, tariffs, anti-dumping duties and other similar trade restrictions that may limit the quantity or affect the price of some types of goods that we import into the U.S. and Canada. In addition, substantial regulatory uncertainty exists regarding international trade relations and trade policy, both in the U.S. and abroad. An introduction of new duties, tariffs, quotas or other similar trade restrictions, or increases in existing duties or tariff rates, on products imported into the U.S. and Canada, whether actual, pending or threatened, may have a negative impact on our results of operations. Significant uncertainty exists as to whether and when tariffs may be imposed, and what countries may be implicated. For example, proposed tariffs on goods imported from Mexico have been introduced and subsequently withdrawn by the U.S. government. The U.S. government has also launched an investigation into currency manipulation and timber trade practices in Vietnam that may result in increased tariffs in imports to the United States from Vietnam. Additionally, the Canadian Border Services Agency has initiated an investigation into alleged injurious dumping and subsidizing of certain upholstered domestic seating originating in or exported from China and Vietnam and imported into Canada. Given that we cannot reasonably predict the timing or outcomes of trade actions by the U.S. government or other countries, the impact of such actions on our business and results of operations remains uncertain. Additionally, such uncertainties, even if not directly applicable to our imported products, may have a negative influence on the domestic and international economy generally and indirectly reduce market demand for our products.\nA significant subset of our products sourced from China has been affected by increased levels of tariffs that were imposed in 2018 and 2019. The initial round of these increased tariffs became effective on certain products that we source from China including furniture and lighting initially as a 10 percent ad valorem duty on September 24, 2018, which amount increased to 25 percent on May 10, 2019, and were slated to increase further to 30 percent on October 1, 2019 before an interim deal was reached between the U.S. and China. On August 1, 2019, a new 10 percent ad valorem duty on additional categories of goods imported from China was announced, which amount was then increased to 15 percent on August 23, 2019. The new tariff at the rate of 15 percent became effective September 1, 2019 with respect to certain categories of goods and had been expected to become effective for additional categories of goods on December 15, 2019. In January 2020, the U.S. and China signed a \u201cPhase One\u201d trade agreement pursuant to which, among other things, the U.S. will modify its Section 301 tariff actions and which suspended the tariff on this additional set of goods. Further, as of February 14, 2020, the 15 percent tariff which was implemented on September 1, 2019 was reduced to 7.5 percent. While the trade deal remains effective, there is no guarantee that the agreement will be honored by either party, and it could be subject to further revision or renegotiation.\nWhile we have been working with our vendor partners on mitigation strategies to seek to address the impact of the tariffs on goods imported from China, such efforts may not be fully sufficient to remediate the impact of the existing ad valorem duty on certain products imported from China or the future ad valorem duties to be imposed on products from China. In addition, such mitigation efforts may not be successful with respect to other pending or future increases in tariffs. While the Biden Administration has indicated that it will not take immediate action to modify these existing tariffs, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the possible application of additional tariffs with respect to China and the possible imposition of tariffs on trade with additional countries other than China. We may not be able to anticipate the exact contours of tariffs and other burdens on global trade that may become applicable and our efforts to respond to these circumstances may be inadequate. In particular, we may not be able to receive or sustain adequate pricing concessions from our vendors with respect to applicable tariffs and any applicable pricing increases that we seek to pass through to our customers may not be successful in achieving our objectives. Our sales may fall in response to any price increases and our vendors may not be able to support the level of pricing concessions that we seek.\nIn addition, we are undertaking ongoing efforts to examine our sourcing strategy in a comprehensive way in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for our business. Such efforts include addressing among other factors the country of origin and the current and potential future imposition of tariffs with respect to particular countries of origin. These efforts to optimize our supply chain may not be successful and we may encounter various obstacles to these and other related initiatives. Although we have moved some of our merchandise sourcing away from China to other countries, these efforts may not achieve the desired outcomes. For example, we may not be able to move sufficient quantities of our product manufacturing to new locations outside of China and the quality of products manufactured in new factories may not meet the requirements of our business. In addition, we may encounter logistics and other challenges in moving manufacturing to new jurisdictions including the potential imposition of new tariffs on products sourced from such other jurisdictions.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that tariffs that are imposed or proposed will not become effective on a longer term basis. In the event that any tariffs applicable to our business become applicable on a longer term basis, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate the impact of such longer term tariffs will be successful.\n22 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nThere can be no assurance that we will not experience disruption in our business related to tariffs or other changes in trade practices and applicable rules or as a result of our efforts to respond to these matters. Tariffs and other similar trade actions are inherently unpredictable and can change quickly based on political or economic pressures or policy changes. Any changes to tariffs or other rules and practices related to cross border trade, including the possible implementation of additional tariffs, could materially increase our cost of goods sold with respect to merchandise that we purchase from vendors who manufacture products in China or other countries outside the U.S., which could in turn require us to increase our prices and, in the event consumer demand declines as a result, negatively impact our financial performance. While we may seek to adopt mitigation measures and changes to our business practices to seek to counteract the effect of such tariffs on our business and results of operations, due to multiple factors that can occur in the context of trade disputes and the inherent unpredictability of how customers and market participants may respond, any mitigation measures we adopt may be not achieve their intended purpose. Certain of our competitors may be better positioned than us to withstand or react to these kinds of changes including border taxes, tariffs or other restrictions on global trade and as a result we may lose market share to such competitors. In addition, to the extent that our competitors, our vendors or companies in other industries that manufacture products in China respond to the tariffs imposed to date or the possibility of future tariffs by shifting production to other countries in Asia or to other regions, the costs of production in such countries may increase, which may increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse impact on our product supply chain. Similarly, to the extent that we or our vendors respond to the tariffs imposed to date or the possibility of future tariffs by shifting merchandise purchases or production to other countries in Asia or to other regions, we may face delays or costs associated with developing new vendor relationships and our vendors may face delays or costs associated with bringing online new manufacturing facilities, which may increase the cost of our products or cause delays in the shipment of our merchandise that result in the cancellation of orders by our customers. An interruption or delay in supply from our foreign sources, or the imposition of additional duties, taxes or other charges on these imports, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements are secured. Due to broad uncertainty regarding the timing, content and extent of any regulatory changes in the U.S. or abroad, we cannot predict the impact, if any, that these changes could have to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur dependence on foreign imports also makes us vulnerable to risks associated with products manufactured abroad, including, among other things, risks of damage, destruction or confiscation of products while in transit to our distribution centers located in the U.S., product quality control charges on or assessment of additional import duties, tariffs, anti-dumping duties and quotas, loss of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status by our foreign trading partners with the U.S., work stoppages, including without limitation as a result of events such as longshoremen strikes, transportation and other delays in shipments, including without limitation as a result of heightened security screening and inspection processes or other port-of-entry limitations or restrictions in the U.S., freight cost increases, political unrest, economic uncertainties, including inflation, foreign government regulations, trade restrictions, increased labor costs and other similar factors that might affect the operations of our vendors in specific countries such as China.\nIn addition, there is a risk of compliance violations by our vendors, which could lead to adverse consequences related to the failure of our vendors to adhere to applicable manufacturing requirements or other applicable rules or regulations. Any such noncompliance could have an adverse impact on our business and may result in product recalls, regulatory action, product liabilities, investigation by governmental agencies and other similar adverse consequences. Any failure by our vendors outside the U.S. to adhere to applicable legal requirements or our global compliance standards such as fair labor standards, prohibitions on child labor and other product safety or manufacturing safety standards could give rise to a range of adverse consequences including the disruption of our supply chain as well as potential liability to us and harm our reputation and brand and could subject us to other adverse consequences including boycotts by our consumer or special interest groups including activists, any of which actions could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 23\nOur growth strategy and performance depend on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices, including products that are produced by artisans and specialty vendors. Any disruptions we experience in our ability to obtain quality products in a timely fashion or in the quantities required could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe purchase substantially all of our merchandise from a number of third party vendors. Many such vendors are the sole sources for particular products, and we generally transact business with such vendors on an order-by-order basis without any long-term or other contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products with our vendors. Therefore, we may be dependent on particular vendors that produce popular items, and any vendor could discontinue selling to us at any time. In addition, the expansion of our business into new U.S. or international markets or new product categories could put pressure on our ability to source sufficient quantities of our products from such vendors. In the event that one or more of our vendors is unable or unwilling to meet the quantity or quality of our product requirements, we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors in a manner that is sufficient to supply the shortfall. We also may be required to develop such new vendor relationships in response to changes in our supply chain. For example, the Biden Administration has indicated that it will retain existing tariffs imposed on China\u2019s exports in the near-term if not longer, and may impose additional trade measures involving China and other countries that could adversely affect the cost of our products sourced from our vendors in China or such other locations. Even if we do identify such new vendors, we may experience product shortages and customer backorders as we transition our product requirements to incorporate alternative suppliers. Our relationship with any new vendor would be subject to the same or similar risks as those of our existing suppliers.\nFurthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our product assortment, and our performance depends on our ability to purchase our merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. However, many of our key products are produced by artisans, specialty vendors and other vendors that are small, undercapitalized or that may have limited production capacity, and we have from time to time in prior periods experienced supply constraints that have affected our ability to supply high demand items or new products due to such capacity and other limits in our vendor base.\nA number of our vendors, particularly our artisan vendors, may have limited financial or other resources and operating histories and may receive various forms of credit from us, including with respect to payment terms or other arrangements. In some cases, we have advanced payments to vendors in order to assist a vendor in funding additional merchandise production to meet our orders. We may advance a portion of the payments to be made to some vendors under our purchase orders prior to the delivery of the ordered products. These advance payments are normally unsecured. Vendors may become insolvent and their failure to repay our advances, and any failure to deliver products to us, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. There can be no assurance that the capacity of any particular vendor will continue to be able to meet our supply requirements in the future, as our vendors may be susceptible to production difficulties or other factors that negatively affect the quantity or quality of their production during future periods. A disruption in the ability of our significant vendors to access liquidity could also cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses, which could lead to a significant reduction in their ability to manufacture or ship products to us. Any difficulties that we experience in our ability to obtain products in sufficient quality and quantity from our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur vendors may sell similar or identical products to our competitors or on their own, which could harm our business.\nBecause the arrangements with our vendors are generally not exclusive, many of our vendors might be able to sell similar or identical products to our competitors. Our competitors may enter into arrangements with suppliers that could impair our ability to sell those suppliers\u2019 products, including by requiring suppliers to enter into exclusive arrangements, which could limit our ability to enter into arrangements with such suppliers or otherwise access their products. Such competitors may also purchase products in significantly greater volume that we do, which may enable them to sell the products at reduced cost or flood the market with similar products.\nOur vendors could also initiate or expand sales of their products through vendor-owned stores or through the Internet to the retail market and therefore directly compete with us or sell their products through outlet centers or discount stores, increasing the competitive pricing pressure we face.\nAny of the above factors could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\n24 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nOur results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in raw materials, energy costs and currency exchange rates.\nIncreases in the prices of the components and raw materials used in our products could negatively affect the sales of our merchandise and our product margins. For example, in recent periods the cost of our products have come under pressure from increased prices for raw materials and shipping and other costs in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business may also be affected by changes in currency exchange rates and as we expand our business internationally, we may be increasingly exposed to risks related to currency values.\nChanges in prices for raw materials and fluctuations in exchange rates are dependent on a number of factors beyond our control, including macroeconomic factors that may affect commodity prices (including prices for oil, lumber and cotton); changes in supply and demand; general economic conditions; significant political events; labor costs; competition; import duties, tariffs, anti-dumping duties and other similar costs; currency exchange rates and government regulation; and events such as natural disasters and widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic). In addition, energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past and, in recent periods, energy prices have been declining and could experience significant volatility in the near term. Depending on the nature of changes in these different factors that affect our business, we may experience an adverse impact on our business for different reasons including increased costs of operation or lower demand for our products. We may experience slower demand from customers in markets that depend upon energy prices for a portion of their economic activity.\nChanges in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, including the Chinese Yuan, may increase our vendors\u2019 cost of business and ultimately our cost of goods sold and our selling, general and administrative costs. If we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers or the higher cost of the products results in decreased demand for our products, our results of operations could be harmed.\nWe are subject to risks associated with occupying substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs. We are pursuing various alternatives to traditional leasing of our Gallery locations that may subject us to a range of risks related to real estate development including risks related to construction and development of locations, risks related to the financing of commercial real estate and the market for commercial real estate.\nWe lease nearly all of our retail store locations and we also lease our outlet stores, our corporate headquarters and other storage and office space, and our distribution and home delivery facilities. The initial lease term of our retail locations generally ranges from ten to fifteen years, and certain leases contain renewal options for anywhere from ten to twenty-five years. The initial lease term for one of our future Design Galleries is forty-one years, and contains a renewal option for five years. Most leases for our retail locations provide for a minimum rent, typically including escalating rent amounts, plus a percentage rent based upon sales after certain minimum thresholds are achieved, as well as common area maintenance charges, real property insurance and real estate taxes.\nWe are currently pursuing several other models for the transformation of our real estate beyond a traditional leasing approach including a real estate development model, a joint venture model and a capital light model. While these alternative models are designed to achieve superior financial returns to traditional real estate lease structures for a retail business, some of these new ways of operation will expose us to a range of different risks. Various aspects of our multi-tier real estate strategy may expose us to new forms of risk versus our traditional leasing model. Our strategies include (1) our \u201ccapital light\u201d leasing deals, where a substantial portion of the capital requirement would be funded by the landlord; (2) our real estate development model where we expect either to do a sale-leaseback transaction or to pre-sell the property and structure the transaction such that the capital to build the project is advanced by the buyer during construction; and (3) our joint venture projects, where we share the upside of the development with the developer/landlord.\nWe recently made various investments in real estate development projects that will support the first RH Ecosystem in Aspen, Colorado, which will include retail locations, hospitality concepts, residential developments, and workforce housing projects.\nThese new approaches might cause us to pursue complicated real estate transactions and may require additional capital investment and could present different risks related to the ownership and developments of real estate compared to those risks associated with a traditional store lease with a landlord, including greater financial exposure if our plans for the relevant real estate are not as successful as we originally anticipate or if the value of the real estate we acquire or invest in subsequently decreases. Pursuing multiple different paths for addressing our real estate needs may create various risks including increased complexity and risks related to the time and costs of real estate development as well as the need for additional capital and risks related to resale of real estate projects. These risks could distract our senior leadership team\u2019s focus, strain our operational resources and personnel, or expose us to new regulatory or tax regimes in which we must develop expertise.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 25\nSeveral of our new real estate development strategies expose us to additional risks related to operating in commercial real estate from a development perspective. Such risks include the cost and financing of the acquisition of real estate interests, market risks related to real estate prices, the time and costs related to developing real estate projects including construction and development risks and other factors that affect the commercial real estate industry more generally. We have not historically operated directly in all phases of real estate development including managing all aspects of construction of large scale real estate projects. With respect to projects such as the future Gallery and Guesthouse in Aspen, we are broadly undertaking increased development risk with respect to our real estate investments and these risks could increase our financial exposure to development cost overruns or other negative factors stemming from these real estate development efforts. Although our strategy in assuming greater risk and responsibility for real estate development in certain projects such as the Aspen project is designed to achieve greater financial returns and a higher overall return on investment, we could face increased downside risks if we encounter difficulties in implementing these strategies such as cost overruns or delays in construction.\nIf we decide to close an existing or future store, we may nonetheless have continuing obligations with respect to that property pursuant to the applicable lease or ownership arrangements, including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Our ability to re-negotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease, to arrange for the sale of an owned property or to negotiate favorable terms for a suitable alternate location could depend on conditions in the real estate market, competition for desirable properties, our relationships with current and prospective landlords and other factors that are not within our control. Our inability to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases or other obligations for stores that we close could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA number of factors that affect our ability to successfully open new stores within the time frames we initially target or optimize our store footprint are beyond our control, and these factors may harm our ability to execute our strategy to transform our real estate, which may negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe are focused on sizing our assortments and our stores to the potential of the market by adjusting the square footage and number of stores on a geographic market-by-market basis. We plan to optimize our real estate by continuing to open larger square footage Galleries in key markets and relocating or closing selected stores in these or adjacent markets. In addition, we have developed prototype Design Galleries that are suited to many smaller North American markets, we intend to continue to open indigenous Bespoke Galleries in the second home markets such as our initiative in Aspen, Colorado, and we intend to open larger Bespoke Design Galleries in the top international markets. When we address the introduction of new stores in a particular market or changes to, or closure of, existing stores, we must make a series of decisions regarding the size and location of new stores (or the existing stores slated to undergo changes or closure) and the impact on our other existing stores in the area or being without presence or \u201cout of the market.\u201d\nOur ability to maximize the productivity of our retail store base, depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to:\nidentify suitable locations, the availability of which is largely outside of our control;\nsize the store locations to the market opportunity;\nretain customers in a certain geographic market when we close stores in such market or an adjacent market;\nnegotiate acceptable new lease terms or lease renewals, modifications or terminations;\nefficiently build and equip new stores or remodel existing locations;\nsource sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of changes in our store footprint in a timely manner;\nsuccessfully integrate changes in our store base into our existing operations and information technology systems;\nobtain or maintain adequate capital resources on acceptable terms;\navoid construction or local permit delays, construction accidents and injuries and cost overruns in connection with the opening of new stores or the expansion or remodeling of existing stores;\nmaintain adequate distribution facilities, information systems and other operational systems to serve our new stores and remodeled stores; and\naddress competitive, merchandising, marketing, distribution and other challenges encountered in connection with expansion into new geographic areas and markets.\n26 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nWe have experienced delays in opening some new stores within the time frames we initially targeted, and may experience such delays again in the future. We have also incurred higher levels of capital and other expenditures associated with the opening of some of our new Gallery locations. While we are investing in strategies to address these challenges in the future, we may not be successful in deploying such strategies or they may not have the effect that we anticipate. Any of the above challenges or other similar challenges could delay or prevent us from completing store openings or the additional remodeling of existing stores or hinder the operations of stores we open or remodel. If any of these challenges delays the opening of a store, our results of operations will be negatively affected as we will incur various costs during the delay without associated store revenue at such location and our overall return on investment and profit goals for some locations could be adversely affected. Unfavorable economic and business conditions and other events could also interfere with our plans to expand or modify store footprints. Changes in regulation or increases in building or construction costs including with respect to the cost of building materials could result in unanticipated increases in real estate development costs or delays in the completion of our real estate projects. Our failure to effectively address challenges such as those listed above could adversely affect our ability to successfully open new stores or change our store footprint in a timely and cost-effective manner and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nReductions in the volume of mall and other in-store traffic or the closing of shopping malls as a result of changing demographic patterns could significantly reduce our sales.\nAlthough many of our most recently opened Design Galleries are developed outside of the shopping mall setting, a significant portion of our existing footprint of legacy Galleries is currently located in shopping malls. Sales at stores located in malls are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those malls. These stores benefit from the ability of the malls to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of the malls as shopping destinations and positive experiences.\nHowever, in recent years there has been a shift in consumer preferences to purchasing certain products online rather than in stores. This shift, particularly when coupled with past unfavorable economic conditions in certain regions, has adversely affected mall traffic in some regions and has threatened the viability of certain commercial real estate firms that operate major shopping malls. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted mall traffic due to social distancing measures and other restrictions applicable to mall operations, which have had our customers\u2019 ability and desire to travel to shopping malls in which some of our legacy Galleries are located.\nThe decline in shopping malls may in turn adversely affect the financial health of other retailers and mall operators leading to store closures and a decline in the productivity of mall shopping environments due to the network effect of mall operations. A continuation of adverse trends affecting mall operations could have a negative impact on the sales generated by our stores currently located in shopping malls.\nIf we are unable to successfully optimize and operate our distribution centers, furniture home delivery centers and other aspects of our supply chain and customer delivery network, or if we are not able to fulfill orders and deliver our merchandise to our customers in an effective manner, our business and results of operations will be harmed.\nOur business depends upon the successful operation of our distribution centers, furniture home delivery centers and other aspects of our supply chain and customer delivery network, as well as upon our order management and fulfillment services and the re-stocking of certain inventories within our stores. The efficient flow of our merchandise requires that our facilities have adequate capacity to support our current level of operations and any anticipated increased levels that may follow from any growth of our business.\nWe are currently engaged in efforts to improve the quality of our customer experience, which includes making changes to the way in which we operate our distributions centers, furniture home delivery centers and other aspects of our supply chain and customer delivery network. Additionally, we plan to invest significant time architecting a new fully integrated back-end operating platform, inclusive of the supply chain network, the home delivery experience as well as a new metric driven quality system and company-wide decision data. Some of these efforts may require us to make significant expenditures in periods in the near term, which may also have a negative effect on our results of operations if there is no associated increase in revenues or decrease in returns or if any such effect is less than anticipated. There can be no assurance however that any of these efforts will be successful or that we will not encounter additional difficulties in achieving higher levels of customer satisfaction.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 27\nWe are also engaged in initiatives to rationalize our SKU count, and in order to realize the anticipated benefits of such initiatives, including through lower inventories and reduced working capital, we have focused on optimizing the use of our distribution centers, furniture home delivery centers and outlets. For example, we have consolidated our distribution center network and we are in the process of opening new outlet and home delivery center locations and reconfiguring our furniture home delivery centers and outlets in order to streamline our operations. While we believe that optimizing and consolidating our distribution centers and other aspects of our supply chain and customer delivery network will allow us to more efficiently manage our inventory and optimize our uses of capital, in the short term such strategy may result in additional costs, including increased freight costs and lease early termination fees. Furthermore, in the past, during periods of significant customer growth and demand, we have found that our distribution centers often run at capacity. If we fail to accurately anticipate the future capacity requirements of our distribution centers, we may experience delays and difficulties in fulfilling orders and delivering merchandise to customers in a timely manner. Furthermore, we may be unable to remedy such issues quickly as opening additional distribution and home delivery facilities can face operational difficulties, such as disruptions in transitioning fulfillment orders to the new distribution facilities, competition for distribution facility space and problems associated with operating new facilities or reducing the size and changing functions of existing facilities. These difficulties can result in a negative experience for our customers. Any delays in fulfilling orders and delivering merchandise to customers, or related negative experience of our customers, could harm our results of operations.\nWe currently rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for the majority of our product shipments, which subjects us to certain risks.\nWe currently rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for product shipments from our vendors to our stores and to our customers outside of certain areas. Our utilization of third-party delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, as well as strikes, work stoppages and inclement weather, which may impact shipping companies\u2019 abilities to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. For example, strikes or even threat of strikes involving longshoreman and clerical workers at ports in the past have completely shut down such ports for periods of time, impacting retail and other industries. If we change shipping companies, we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries and we would incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from the third-party transportation providers we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs.\nOur operations have significant liquidity and capital requirements and depend on the availability of adequate financing and sources of capital on reasonable terms. If we fail to use our financial resources effectively, or if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital when needed, it could have a significant negative effect on our ability to grow our business.\nWe have historically relied on the availability of debt financing as one primary source of capital in order to fund our operations, including borrowings under our revolving line of credit. We have also incurred indebtedness to finance other strategic initiatives, including our share repurchase programs, and we may continue to incur indebtedness to support such initiatives in future time periods. We completed convertible debt financings in fiscal 2014, fiscal 2015, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. Following repayment of the first two of these convertible note issuances at maturity, $685 million in aggregate principal amount remains outstanding as of January 30, 2021. As of January 30, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings and $271.9 million of availability under our revolving line of credit facility, net of $15.4 million in outstanding letters of credit.\nOur existing indebtedness and any other indebtedness we may incur in the future could have significant consequences on our future operations and financial results, including:\nmaking it more difficult for us to meet our payments and other obligations;\nreducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic investments and other general corporate requirements, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these or other purposes;\nsubjecting us to increased interest expense related to any indebtedness we may incur with variable interest rates;\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to (and increasing our vulnerability to), changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.\n28 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nAny of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or ability to meet our payment obligations.\nOur revolving line of credit contains various restrictive covenants, including, among others, limitations on the ability to incur liens, make loans or other investments, incur additional debt, issue additional equity, merge or consolidate with or into another person, sell assets, pay dividends or make other distributions, or enter into transactions with affiliates. These restrictive covenants may limit the amount of borrowings available to us under our line of credit and our operational and financial flexibility. We may face financial and contractual consequences to the extent we are not able to maintain our compliance with such covenants, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will have significant capital requirements for the operation of our business in the near term if we are to continue to pursue all of our current business initiatives. We have substantial capital requirements related to investments in our business, our real estate strategy, our international expansion, the development of new businesses and our significant number of concurrent initiatives. We have invested significant capital expenditures in remodeling and opening new Galleries, and these capital expenditures have increased in the past and may continue to increase in future periods as we open additional Design Galleries, which may require us to undertake upgrades to historical buildings or construction of new buildings. During fiscal 2020, our adjusted capital expenditures were $180.6 million, inclusive of cash received related to landlord tenant allowances of $17.3 million. The exact scope of our capital plans in future fiscal years, including fiscal 2021, will depend on a variety of factors including the level of gross capital expenditures that we undertake in our business, the amount of any proceeds from the sale of assets including sales of real estate and the way that our business performs.\nOur current real estate strategy involves opening Design Galleries in select major metropolitan markets, developing new RH model Design Galleries and Galleries tailored to secondary markets, and opening indigenous Bespoke Galleries in the second home markets, as well as pursuing category extensions of our brand and exploring new business areas. Although we principally relied upon leases with landlords for most of our Gallery locations historically, in recent years we have begun to pursue a real estate development model strategy for some of our new Gallery developments in which we invest in the ownership of real estate or take on greater risk with respect to the cost of development of the new Gallery. Upon completion of the development of a new Gallery, we may sell the property to a third party such as we did in fiscal 2019 through the sale-leaseback transaction for the Yountville Design Gallery and in July 2020 through the sale-leaseback transaction for the Minneapolis Design Gallery. The real estate development model may require us to pursue additional capital expenditures beyond what is required under a traditional leasing model. While we may be able to recoup substantial amounts of capital and may also achieve gains on our capital investments if we are successful with this model and are able to sell the real estate interests on favorable terms to a real estate investor in a sale-leaseback transaction, we will be assuming greater risks with this model. At the same time, we may not recoup our costs in such transactions as we will incur substantial real estate development risk in the construction of Galleries under this model and as a result could incur losses from such efforts.\nAs we develop new Galleries, as well as potentially other strategic initiatives in the future like our integrated hospitality experience, we may explore other models for our real estate, which could include longer lease terms or further purchases of, or joint ventures or other forms of equity ownership in, real estate interests associated with new sites and buildings including the development of adjacent real estate beyond the Gallery location. In the case of our recent investments in real estate development in Aspen, Colorado, we are undertaking real estate development risk with respect to other locations beyond our planned Gallery and Guesthouse. Although some of the other locations will be devoted to other aspects of our RH Ecosystem concept, we will also own interests in properties where we are essentially in a real estate ownership and development model and where we will derive returns from income due to leasing and capital appreciation of real estate interests.\nThese approaches might require greater capital investment than a traditional store lease with a landlord. In the event that such capital and other expenditures require us to pursue additional funding sources, we can provide no assurances that we will be successful in securing additional funding on attractive terms or at all. While our general approach has been to target capital toward investments that we believe will achieve favorable returns for our shareholders, these decisions involve a significant amount of judgment regarding the availability of capital and the anticipated growth of the business in both revenue and earnings in future periods.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 29\nWe take an opportunistic approach to both sources and uses of capital in our business and our allocation of capital in connection with our business may be driven by the chance to achieve favorable returns on using debt financings in order to fund our capital investments. We may elect to incur additional debt to fund future capital investments including our share repurchase programs. We can provide no assurances of the exact financial and operational impact of previous or future investments in our share repurchase programs on our business and results of operation and the resulting incurrence of debt may have an impact on our future liquidity position and capital available for other aspects of our business. Although our share repurchase programs are intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, depending on the exact financial and operational impact of these investments on our business, as well as variability in the prices of our common stock and other instruments linked to the price of our common stock, there can be no assurance that share repurchases will have the benefits that we expect.\nWhen we have purchased shares in the market as part of our share repurchase programs, we have generally undertaken such transactions out of a belief that the shares represent a good investment and that the market price for the shares may be undervalued. There can be no assurance that these decisions will prove to be correct as valuation of common stock is subject to a range of factors and is subject to inherent degrees of uncertainty. Over time it may turn out that the value of our common stock will be substantially higher or lower than some of the prices that we pay to undertake repurchase transactions. For example, the market price of our common stock may subsequently decline below the levels at which repurchases were made or it may appreciate to prices substantially above the amounts we pay for the buyback. If we access capital through sales of our common stock or other securities linked to the price of our common stock, our investors may experience dilution from such capital transactions as has occurred with respect to the sale of our prior convertible notes offerings and there can be no assurance that such financing will be incurred at prices that are higher for shares of our common stock than the prices at which we engaged in share repurchases.\nPursuit of investments in connection with our share repurchase programs may expose us to other risks in connection with our business including legal and financial constraints, risks related to capital allocation, the level of indebtedness that we carry, increases costs for borrowing, risks related to legal claims and litigation and increased dependency on capital markets and sources of financing to fund the requirements of our business including the costs of any share repurchases. To the extent that we incur indebtedness in connection with our business in connection with or as a result of our share repurchases, the requirements of such debt may include terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect upon our business including as a result of restrictive financial or operational covenants, burdensome rates of interest, cross defaults and other terms that may reduce our operational or financial flexibility or cause us to incur substantial costs including restructuring or refinancing such indebtedness.\nIn addition, while we anticipate that we should be able to repay our debt maturities as they come due, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at the maturity of any specific indebtedness, whether upon its state maturity or otherwise. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt or refinance existing debt in order to achieve repayment of existing debt.\nIf the Company is not able to arrange financing to repay its debt obligations, or to extend the maturities of existing debt or otherwise refinance the Company\u2019s obligations as needed, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For example, in certain circumstances, we may be required to repay the two series of convertible senior notes that we issued in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 with cash payments. See Item 2 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Convertible Senior Notes. At the time the notes become due, and prior to maturity to the extent holders exercise their conversion right, the trading price of our common stock may be such that we may find it necessary to settle the notes in cash. There can be no assurance that we will be able to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. In addition, agreements governing any debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. In addition, if we fail to purchase the notes, to pay special interest, if any, due on the notes, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the respective indentures governing the notes, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion.\nThe need to service and repay our convertible senior notes or other debt obligations could cause us to incur additional borrowings or issue additional debt to investors and lenders. We may also experience cash flow shortfalls in the future, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, and we may otherwise require additional external funding, or we may need to raise funds to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, to make acquisitions of other businesses or companies or to respond to changing business conditions or unanticipated competitive pressures.\n30 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nDuring fiscal 2017, we increased the aggregate level of our indebtedness through various forms of debt financing and our net debt to trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA reached a level in excess of 5X during this time period. Our business has performed very well since that time and we have increased earnings, generated substantial cash flow, paid down debt and reduced this leverage ratio to a level of 0.7X at the end of fiscal 2020. At the same time, we may elect to incur additional debt and increase the level of indebtedness in our leverage ratio in the future. Any increase in debt and the level of indebtedness in our leverage ratio could expose us to greater risks in the event of a financial or operational downturn or other events including unanticipated adverse developments that affect our financial performance or the ability to access financial markets. To the extent we pursue additional debt as a source of liquidity, our capitalization profile may change and may include significant leverage, and as a result we may be required to use future liquidity to repay such indebtedness and may be subject to additional terms and restrictions which affect our operations and future uses of capital. Our ability to raise funds will depend in part on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time and we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise necessary funds on favorable terms, if at all, or that future financing requirements would not be dilutive to holders of our capital stock. If we fail to raise sufficient additional funds, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under our convertible senior notes and other debt obligations. We may also be required to delay or abandon some of our planned future expenditures or aspects of our current operations.\nOur business is dependent on certain key personnel; if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to retain continued service of certain key personnel, particularly our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gary Friedman, and to attract and retain additional qualified key personnel in the future. We face risks related to loss of any key personnel and we also face risks related to any changes that may occur in key senior leadership positions. Any disruption in the services of our key personnel could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. These changes could also increase the volatility of our stock price.\nMany of our key personnel periodically travel together while on company business. We do not have a policy that prohibits key officers and directors from flying together, whether flying commercially or in our corporate aircraft. We face risks related to any loss of key personnel that might arise as a result of such travel arrangements. In addition, we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our key personnel. As a result, we may not be able to cover the financial loss we may incur in losing the services of any of our key personnel.\nCompetition for qualified employees and personnel in the retail industry is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters are located, and we may be unable to retain personnel that are important to our business or hire additional qualified personnel. The process of identifying personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our goals is often lengthy. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified senior leadership, marketing and sales personnel, and store managers, and upon the continued contributions of these people. In addition, our complex operations require the services of qualified and experienced senior leadership personnel, with expertise in the areas including information technology and supply chain management. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified executives and personnel. In addition, we are pursuing a dynamic business model which is subject to a number of new business initiatives as we seek to optimize our business and financial performance. As a result of the ongoing evolution of our business, we frequently implement changes to our organizational design in order to more closely align our senior leadership structure with the needs of the business. In connection with such changes to our senior leadership structure, we also implement changes in personnel and reductions in force as a result of which we may incur severance costs and other reorganization charges and expenses. Changes in our organizational structure may also have an impact on retention of personnel.\nInasmuch as our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of store and other employees who understand and appreciate our corporate culture and customers. Turnover in the retail industry and food and beverage industry is generally high. Excessive employee turnover will result in higher employee costs associated with finding, hiring and training new store employees. If we are unable to hire and retain store and other personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, our ability to open new stores, service the needs of our customers and expand our food and beverage business may be impaired, the performance of our existing and new stores and operations could be materially adversely affected and our brand image may be negatively impacted.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 31\nMaterial damage to, or interruptions in, our information systems as a result of external factors, staffing shortages, cybersecurity breaches or cyber fraud, or difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations, and we may be exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our customers\u2019 information.\nWe depend largely upon our information technology systems in the conduct of all aspects of our operations, many of which we have only adopted and implemented within the past several years or are in the midst of implementing. These systems can be complex to develop, maintain, upgrade and protect against emerging threats, and we may fail to adequately hire or retain adequate personnel to manage our information systems, we may fail to accurately gauge the level of financial and managerial resources to invest in our information systems, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of resources invested in our information systems particularly as our business changes as a result of the many initiatives that we are pursuing. Such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and natural disasters. In addition, damage or interruption can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including vandalism, catastrophic events, and human error. Damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace the affected system, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Third parties that we share data with also face risks relating to cybersecurity and we do not directly control any of such parties\u2019 information security or privacy operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our systems or the products or systems of our third party vendors or other third parties that we share data with may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOver the last several years, there has been a substantial increase in the scope of cybersecurity attacks reported in the U.S. During this time, we have experienced numerous cybersecurity attacks and have had to expend increasing amounts of human and financial capital to address this issue. We expect that these cybersecurity attacks will continue and that the scope of sophistication of these efforts may increase in future periods. While we aim to remediate known vulnerabilities on a timely basis, and to adopt countermeasures to address risks, we do not expect that our efforts will eliminate these risks or result in 100% success in thwarting attacks. Any failure to address vulnerabilities in a timely and comprehensive matter, including shortcomings in our efforts to timely replace and upgrade network equipment, servers, or other technology assets, could result in a successful breach of our systems. There can be no assurance that our efforts to ensure the integrity of our information technology systems will be fully successful. We may not be able to anticipate, detect or implement adequate preventive measures against all cyber threats because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target.\nOur operations are also dependent on the information technology systems and cybersecurity measures of our third party vendors. Attempted cyber intrusions into our information systems through compromised vendor networks or products, if successful, could compromise our information systems. In addition, our information systems can face risks to the extent we acquire new businesses but are not able to quickly or comprehensively integrate such acquired businesses into our policies and procedures for addressing cybersecurity risks or identify and address weaknesses in such acquired entity\u2019s information systems, which risks may be compounded to the extent the information systems of an acquired entity are integrated with ours, thus providing access to a broader set of sensitive customer information through a compromised network at the acquired entity level. If a computer hacker or other third party is able to circumvent our security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any successful breaches or attempted intrusions could result in increased information systems costs and potential reputational damage, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, in order for our business to function successfully, we and other market participants must be able to handle and transmit confidential and personal information securely, including in customer orders placed through our website. That information includes data about our customers, including personally identifiable information and credit card information, as well as sensitive information about our vendors and workforce, including social security numbers and bank account information. If our systems are damaged, interrupted or subject to unauthorized access, information about our customers, vendors or workforce could be stolen or misused. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, fines, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and harm our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. We may be subject to one or more claims or lawsuits related to the intentional or unintentional release of confidential or personal information, including personally identifiable information about our customers, vendors or workforce. In addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to expend significant resources to change our business practices or modify our service offerings in connection with the protection of personally identifiable information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any breach could also cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our website and information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us.\n32 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nWe are also subject to payment card association rules and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change over time. For example, we are subject to payment card industry data security standards, which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. In addition, if our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and/or debit card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nStates and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft, including laws governing treatment of personally identifiable information. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, impose stringent requirements on how we and third parties with whom we contract collect and process personal information, and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. These laws have increased the costs of doing business and, if we fail to implement appropriate safeguards or we fail to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies. If we were required to pay any significant amount in satisfaction of claims under these laws, or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may also incur legal costs if we are required to defend our methods of collection, processing and storage of personal data. Investigations, lawsuits, or adverse publicity relating to our methods of handling personal data could result in increased costs and negative market reaction.\nFurthermore, data security breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions have attracted a substantial amount of media attention, prompting additional state and federal proposals addressing data privacy and security. As the data privacy and security laws and regulations evolve, we may be subject to more extensive requirements to protect the customer information that we process in connection with the purchases of our products. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe currently maintain insurance to protect against cybersecurity risks and incidents. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage may be insufficient or may not cover certain cybersecurity losses and liability.\nWe face product liability risks and certain of our products may be subject to recalls or other actions by regulatory authorities, and any such recalls or similar actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe face product liability, product safety and product compliance risks relating to the design, manufacturing, raw material sourcing, testing, contents, importation, sale, use and performance of some of our products. The products we sell must be designed and manufactured to be safe for their intended purposes. Some of our products must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations. For example, some of our products are subject to the Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (the \u201cCPSIA\u201d) and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, which empower the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the \u201cCPSC\u201d) to establish product bans, substance bans, substance limits, performance requirements, test methods and other compliance verification processes. The CPSC is empowered to take action against hazards presented by consumer products, up to and including product recalls. We are required to report certain incidents related to the safety and compliance of our products to the CPSC, and failure to do so could result in a civil penalty. The CPSC is particularly active in regulation and enforcement activities related to the kinds of children\u2019s products sold in our RH Baby & Child division. Certain of the products we sell are subject to the Lacey Act, prohibiting the importation and sale of products containing illegally harvested wood, among other things. Likewise, many of our products are subject to the regulations of the California Air Resources Board (the \u201cCARB\u201d) and the Environmental Protection Agency regarding formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products (e.g., plywood and medium density fiberboard).\nIf we experience negative publicity, regardless of any factual basis, customer complaints or litigation alleging illness or injury, related to our products, or if there are allegations of failure to comply with applicable regulations, our brand reputation would be harmed.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 33\nWe maintain a product safety and compliance program to help ensure our products are safe, legal and made consistently in compliance with our values. Nevertheless, our products have in the past (including during fiscal 2020) been, and may in the future be, subject to recall for product safety and compliance reasons. Our efforts to address the sources of these product recalls, including those due to products sourced from our vendors, may not be successful and we may continue to face additional product recalls. Concerns of product safety and compliance could result in future voluntary or involuntary removal of products, product recalls, other actions by applicable government authorities or product liability, personal injury or property damage claims. To the extent future product recalls create a negative public perception of our business, we could face reputational harm or could be subject to elevated levels of legal claims. There can be no assurance that we will have the benefit of adequate insurance or payments from third parties including our product vendors in order to address losses and expenses that we may incur in connection with product recalls. Not all of the costs and expenses that we have previously incurred in connection with product recalls have been covered by insurance or reimbursement from third parties including our product vendors. We and our product vendors may be unable to obtain such insurance or the insurance may be prohibitively expensive and any coverage that is available may be inadequate to cover costs we incur in connection with product recalls.\nFederal, state, provincial and local legislators and regulators in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., where our products are sold, continue to adopt new product laws and regulations. These new laws and regulations have increased or likely will significantly increase the regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and sale of certain of our products as well as the potential penalties for noncompliance with applicable regulations. In addition, product recalls, removal of products, product compliance enforcement actions and defending product liability claims can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation and increased customer service costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings from time to time that may affect our Company and/or our senior leadership including litigation, claims, investigations and regulatory and other proceedings, which could distract senior leadership from our business activities and result in significant liability.\nFrom time to time, we and/or members of our senior leadership team are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings including litigation, claims, investigations and regulatory and other proceedings related to a range of matters in connection with the conduct of our business, including (i) privacy and data security, (ii) our labor and employment practices including laws related to discrimination, wages and benefits, ERISA and disability claims, (iii) intellectual property issues with respect to copyright, trademarks, patents and trade dress, (iv) trade and business practices including unfair competition and unfair business practices, (v) consumer class action claims relating to our consumer practices including the collection of zip code or other information from customers, (vi) product safety and compliance including products liability, product recalls personal injury, (vii) advertising and promotion of products and services, (viii) compliance with securities laws including class actions related to allegations of securities fraud, (ix) taxation, (x) contractual disputes, and (xi) health and safety regulations.\nClaims and legal proceedings may involve arbitration, mediation, private litigation, class action matters, derivative claims, investigations and enforcement matters. We are subject to regulatory oversight and legal enforcement by a range of government and self-regulatory organizations including federal, state and local governmental bodies both within the U.S. and in other jurisdictions where we operate such as, among others, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the CPSC, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Labor, the SEC, FINRA, the NYSE, the Department of Justice and numerous state and local governmental authorities including state attorney generals and state agencies. Litigation against us, depending on the outcome of such claims, could lead to further claims and proceedings including on new and otherwise unrelated matters, for example by attracting the attention of plaintiff\u2019s firms or of regulators.\nWe have recently faced certain securities litigations, including securities class action cases that were consolidated by the court (the \u201cClass Action Case\u201d) and certain related legal proceedings (collectively, the \u201cDerivative Case\u201d). We are also currently responding to several governmental investigations regarding trading in our securities. We have settled the Class Action Case, and the court granted final approval of the Class Action Case settlement on October 25, 2019 and entered a final judgment dismissing the action, and such settlement has been funded entirely by our insurance carriers. On March 24, 2020, we reached an agreement in principle to settle the Derivative Case and subsequently entered into a stipulation of settlement that was preliminarily approved by the Court on August 3, 2020. The settlement involved certain non-monetary terms as well as payment of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 legal fees, which payment was funded entirely by our insurance carriers. On October 6, 2020, the Court held a final settlement hearing. On December 18, 2020, the court granted final approval of the settlement and entered a final judgment dismissing the action.\n34 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nLegal proceedings often involve complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant leadership time that could otherwise be focused on our operations. Furthermore, legal proceedings where the related claims involve members of our leadership team could distract our senior leadership from the operation of our business, damage the reputation of our leadership team and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and leadership morale. Litigation and other claims and regulatory proceedings against members of our senior leadership team or us could result in unexpected expenses and liability and could also materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation. We maintain insurance for legal proceedings but there can be no assurance that such insurance will be available for the payment of all or any portion of the costs associated with any particular investigation, legal proceedings or other claims against us, or that coverage under any such insurance will be adequate to fund the full cost of any such legal proceedings including the costs of investigation, defense and resolution of any such legal proceedings.\nIntellectual property claims by third parties or our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position.\nThird parties have in the past asserted, and may in the future assert, intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business to include new products and product categories and move into other geographic markets. Our defense of any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming and could divert senior leadership resources. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability and prevent us from selling some of our products. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights from third parties or cease using those rights altogether, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, trade dress and unfair competition laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that our photographs, trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating certain of our products and brand from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for certain of our products. We have from time to time encountered other retailers selling products substantially similar to our products or misrepresenting that the products such retailers were selling were our products. We cannot assure you that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights by others (especially with respect to infringement by non-U.S. entities with no physical U.S. presence), including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our images and brand. The costs of defending and enforcing our intellectual property assets may incur significant time and legal expense, and we may not be entirely successful in protecting our assets, enforcing our rights or collecting on judgments as a prevailing party. If we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position could suffer.\nCompliance with laws, including laws relating to our business activities outside of the U.S., may be costly, and changes in laws could make conducting our business more expensive or otherwise change the way we do business.\nWe are subject to numerous regulations, including labor and employment, customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, e-commerce, privacy, health and safety, real estate, environmental and zoning and occupancy laws, and other laws and regulations that regulate retailers, food and beverage providers or otherwise govern our business. In addition, to the extent we expand our operations as a result of engaging in new business initiatives or product lines, pursuing our multi-tier real estate strategy or expanding into new international markets, we may become subject to new regulations and regulatory regimes. We may need to continually reassess our compliance procedures, personnel levels and regulatory framework in order to keep pace with the numerous business initiatives that we are pursuing, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so. If the regulations applicable to our business operations were to change or were violated by us or our vendors or buying agents, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our products and harm our business and results of operations. In addition to increased regulatory compliance requirements, changes in laws could make ordinary conduct of our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. In addition, as a retail business, changes in laws related to employee benefits and treatment of employees, including laws related to limitations on employee hours, supervisory status, leaves of absence, mandated health benefits or overtime pay, could negatively impact us by increasing compensation and benefits costs for overtime and medical expenses. Changes to U.S. health care laws, or potential global and domestic greenhouse gas emission requirements and other environmental legislation and regulations, could result in increased direct compliance costs for us (or may cause our vendors to raise the prices they charge us in order to maintain profitable operations because of increased compliance costs), increased transportation costs or reduced availability of raw materials.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 35\nIn fiscal 2020, we sourced 85% of our products from outside the United States based on the dollar volume of purchases. The foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations are complex and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance, or limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other similar laws and regulations, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign governmental officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-bribery laws and other anti-corruption laws, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in preventing our employees or other agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations. Such violations, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLabor organizing and other activities could negatively impact us.\nCurrently, none of our employees are represented by a union. However, our employees have the right at any time to form or affiliate with a union, and union organizational activities have occurred from time to time. We cannot predict the negative effects that any future organizing activities will have on our business and operations. If we were to become subject to work stoppages, we could experience disruption in our operations and increases in our labor costs, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, one of our key value driving strategies involves the development and introduction of new Gallery locations. We pursue a range of different real estate development models for these projects. In a number of these projects, we perform a significant role in various aspects of the design and construction of the Gallery location. Both we and third party contractors that we use in these construction projects may be subject to efforts and activities by organized labor to drive the hiring of union labor on these projects. To the extent that union workers are not involved in these projects, we and our third party contractors may be subject to picketing and other labor actions that could affect our business including protests in front of our Gallery locations in order to discourage our customers from entering our stores, which could adversely affect our business at those locations and our results of operations, including our same-store sales metrics. In addition, to the extent that we become more directly involved in additional aspects of the construction work at our Gallery locations, we could be subject to additional pressure from organized labor including union organizing efforts.\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate and realization of our deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, may result in volatility of our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. We record income tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions, and valuation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. We expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings, timing of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, changes in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations.\n36 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our results of operations.\nNew accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or current accounting practice and the exact impact of such changes may not be what we anticipate. A change in accounting rules or regulations may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective and future changes to accounting rules or regulations or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our results of operations. For example, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the adoption of which materially impacted the timing of recognizing advertising expense related to direct response advertising, including costs associated with our Source Books. In addition, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-02-Leases (Topic 842) in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the adoption of which materially impacted our financial statements including (i) our consolidated balance sheets due to the initial recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities for our operating and finance lease arrangements, (ii) our consolidated statements of income, specifically cost of goods sold and interest expense-net, primarily due to the change from the build-to-suit lease transactions under the previous accounting guidance to the new finance lease classification treatment, and (iii) our cash flows due to amortization and interest expense for our operating and finance lease arrangements and classification of landlord assets under construction. For information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, refer to \u201cRecently Issued Accounting Standards\u201d within Note 3-Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements within Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may be unsuccessful in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities or, to the extent that we pursue attractive acquisition opportunities, we may be unsuccessful in completing or realizing the expected benefits of such acquisitions.\nAs part of exploring growth opportunities, we may from time to time seek to acquire value-creating, add-on businesses that we believe will broaden our existing position and market reach and have completed several different acquisitions in recent years. For example, in fiscal 2016, we acquired a controlling interest in Waterworks. In the fourth quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $17.4 million and $33.7 million, respectively, with respect to Waterworks due to indicators identified in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 that there could be an impairment of the Waterworks reporting unit. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded tradename impairment charges of $20.5 million and $14.6 million, respectively, with respect to Waterworks due to indicators identified in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 that there could be an impairment of the Waterworks reporting unit. Refer to Note 3-Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements within Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that the Waterworks business will meet its future operating or financial objectives and if its results do not improve we may recognize additional charges related to this business and our financial results of operation may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to find suitable businesses to purchase if we choose to acquire additional businesses, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, that we will be successful in realizing the benefits of any acquisition we pursue or that any of the businesses which we acquire will meet our objectives. If we are unsuccessful in any such acquisition efforts, then our ability to continue to grow at rates we anticipate could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we face the risk that an acquired business may not be successful on the RH platform and may underperform relative to expectations. We may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated, we may be exposed to unexpected liabilities or we may be unable to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business model and platform. The success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to effectively manage the business after the acquisition. The process of maintaining the right incentives for senior leadership of acquired businesses and integrating the acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. Our failure to incorporate acquired businesses into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisitions or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 37\nAny efforts that we undertake to improve the operations of an acquired business or to improve the integration of such business with our larger business operations may not be successful and may create additional operational challenges, in particular at a time when we are also engaged in numerous initiatives with regard to both our existing businesses and operations as well as to launching new business initiatives. To the extent we are unsuccessful in such efforts, and an acquired business does not perform in line with our expectations or does not contribute to the overall performance of our business, our gross margins, results of operations and business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur total assets include intangible assets with an indefinite life, goodwill, tradename and trademarks, and substantial amounts of long-lived assets, principally property and equipment and lease right-of-use assets. Changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of these assets, or results of operations that are lower than our current estimates at certain store locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur total assets include intangible assets with an indefinite life, goodwill, tradename, trademarks and domain names, and substantial amounts of property and equipment and lease right-of-use assets. We evaluate these long-lived assets for possible impairment annually or earlier if impairment indicators exist and make certain estimates and projections in connection with the impairment analyses for these long-lived assets. We also review the carrying value of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset, asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value. These calculations require us to make a number of estimates and projections of future results. If these estimates or projections change, we may be required to record additional impairment charges on certain of these assets. If these impairment charges were significant, our results of operations would be adversely affected. Refer to \u201cImpairment\u201d within Note 3-Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements within Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), which requires us to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. We have in the past periodically experienced deficiencies in our internal controls that have been identified during the audit process or at other times. If we identify in the future one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Therefore, even if our senior leadership team concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is qualified if they are not satisfied with our controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated, or reviewed. Material weaknesses and significant deficiencies may be identified during the audit process or at other times.\nOur reporting obligations as a public company place a significant strain on our senior leadership team and our operational and financial resources and systems and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. In addition, we have experienced changes in personnel who are involved in our financial reporting. Although we believe that we have invested adequate resources in developing and maintaining the procedures, personnel and systems necessary to support our reporting obligations, there can be no assurance that these efforts have been or will be successful. Changes in personnel, systems or procedures, as well as other events might have an adverse impact on our internal controls. Deficiencies in our internal controls or other challenges in the financial reporting aspects of our business may have an adverse impact on our ability to provide financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures and may give rise to errors in our financial statement. There can be no assurance that our internal controls and financial reporting infrastructure and personnel have in the past complied, or will continue in the future to comply, with our financial reporting obligations. If we fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce reliable financial reports. Our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could prevent us from filing our periodic reports on a timely basis, which could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, harm our business, and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\n38 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nOur operations are subject to risks of natural or man-made disasters, acts of war, terrorism or widespread illness, any one of which could result in a business stoppage and negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facilities, computer systems and personnel. Our operations and consumer spending may be affected by natural or man-made disasters or other similar events, including floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, widespread illness, fires, loss of power, interruption of other utilities, industrial accidents, social unrest and riots. In particular, our corporate headquarters is located in Northern California and other parts of our operations are located in Northern and Southern California, each of which is vulnerable to the effects of disasters, including fires and earthquakes that could disrupt our operations and affect our results of operations, and there is evidence that extreme weather, extended drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires in California. Many of our vendors are also located in areas that may be affected by such events. Moreover, geopolitical or public safety conditions which affect consumer behavior and spending may impact our business. Terrorist attacks or other hostilities, or threats thereof, in the U.S. or in other countries around the world, as well as future events occurring in response to or in connection with them, could again result in reduced levels of consumer spending. Any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our results of operations, revenue and costs.\nIf in the future we encounter difficulties associated with any of our facilities, such as the disruptions we experienced related to the COVID-19 pandemic, or if any of our facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of a natural disaster, we could face shortages of inventory resulting in backorders, significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to both our stores and online customers and the inability to process orders in a timely manner or ship goods to our customers. Further, any significant interruption in the operation of our customer service centers could also reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores and customers, which could result in lost sales, cancelled sales and a loss of loyalty to our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price for our common stock has experienced extreme volatility. As a retailer, our results are significantly affected by factors outside our control, particularly consumer spending and consumer confidence, which can significantly affect our stock price. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as the following:\nmacroeconomic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic;\nquarterly variations in our results of operations compared to market expectations;\nchanges in preferences of our customers;\nannouncements of new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors;\nsize of our public float;\nstock price performance of our competitors;\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\ndefault on our indebtedness;\nactions by competitors or other shopping center tenants;\nchanges in senior leadership or key personnel;\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations;\nactual or anticipated negative earnings or other announcements by us or other retail companies;\ndowngrades in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our competitors;\nnatural or man-made disasters or other similar events;\nissuances or expected issuances of capital stock; and\nglobal economic, legal and regulatory changes unrelated to our performance.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 39\nIn the future, we may issue our securities in connection with financings or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with financings or acquisitions could result in dilution to our shares of common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could affect our share price and impair our ability to use common stock or other instruments linked to our common stock as a means of obtaining future financing.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many retail companies. Stockholders can institute securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. We have been subject to such class action securities litigation and may experience further claims of this kind. Any such securities litigation can result in substantial costs and expenses and the attention of our senior leadership could be diverted from our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nOur certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), and prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition, subject to certain exceptions. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on shares of our common stock and do not anticipate that we will pay any such cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\n40 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nExpectations of our company relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers and other key stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors. We expect that an increased focus on ESG considerations will affect some aspects of our operations. There are a number of constituencies that are involved in a range of ESG issues including investors, special interest groups, public and consumer interest groups and third party service providers. As a result, there is an increased emphasis on corporate responsibility ratings and a number of third parties provide reports on companies in order to measure and assess corporate responsibility performance. In addition, the ESG factors by which companies\u2019 corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. Alternatively, if we are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. We risk damage to our brand and reputation in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. We may be required to make substantial investments in matters related to ESG which could require significant investment and impact our results of operations. Any failure in our decision-making or related investments in this regard could affect consumer perceptions as to our brand. Furthermore, if our competitors\u2019 corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding ESG matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors and other key stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe expect that our common stock may experience increased trading volatility in connection with our Convertible Notes Financings.\nIn September 2019, we issued $350 million of 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d). In June 2018, we issued $300 million of 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2023 and, on June 26, 2018, we issued an additional $35 million pursuant to the exercise of an overallotment option granted to the initial purchasers as part of the June 2018 offering (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d and, together with the 2024 Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d). In connection with each offering of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain counterparties (the \u201cBond Hedge\u201d) and warrant transactions (the \u201cWarrants\u201d and together with the Notes and the Bond Hedge, the \u201cConvertible Notes Financings\u201d) with the same counterparties (the \u201chedge counterparties\u201d).\nWe have been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedge positions with respect to the Bond Hedge and Warrants, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates would likely purchase shares of our common stock or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes, including with certain investors in the Notes. These hedging activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the Notes.\nIn addition, we expect that many investors in, including future purchasers of, the Notes may employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Notes. Investors would typically implement such a strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the Notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while continuing to hold the Notes. Investors may also implement this type of strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of or in addition to short selling the common stock.\nFurther, investors in the Notes may periodically modify their arbitrage strategies with respect to the Notes or modify their hedge positions with respect to the Notes from time to time. The hedge counterparties and/or their respective affiliates also may periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time (and are likely to do so during the conversion period relating to any conversion of the Notes or following any repurchase of Notes by us on any fundamental repurchase date or otherwise). Such modifications may be implemented by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock, and/or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions and/or open market transactions. The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading prices of the Notes (which could affect a noteholder\u2019s ability to convert the Notes or the amount and value of the consideration received upon conversion of the Notes) will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nPART I\nFORM 10-K | 41\nIt is not possible to predict the effect that these hedging or arbitrage strategies adopted by holders of the Notes or counterparties to the Bond Hedge and Warrants will have on the market price of our common stock. For example, the SEC and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have implemented various rules and taken certain actions, and may in the future adopt additional rules and take other actions, that may impact those engaging in short selling activity involving equity securities (including our common stock). Such rules and actions include Rule 201 of SEC Regulation SHO, the adoption by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. and the national securities exchanges of a \u201cLimit Up-Limit Down\u201d program, the imposition of market-wide circuit breakers that halt trading of securities for certain periods following specific market declines, and the implementation of certain regulatory reforms required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Any changes in government regulations or other factors that affect the manner in which third parties can engage in hedging strategies, including entering into short sales or swaps on our common stock, could adversely affect the trading prices and the liquidity of the Notes and/or our common stock.\nTaken together, the Bond Hedge and Warrants are intended, but not guaranteed, to offset any actual earnings dilution that could occur upon delivery of shares of common stock to satisfy to our conversion obligation under the Notes until our stock price exceeds the strike price of the Warrants. For the 2024 Notes, the corresponding Bond Hedge and Warrants are intended to limit the earnings dilution that our stockholders would experience until the Company\u2019s common stock is above approximately $338.24 per share, the strike price of the 2024 Notes warrant transactions, which represented a 100% premium over the closing price of our common stock at the time we entered into the Bond Hedge and Warrants related to the 2024 Notes. For the 2023 Notes, the corresponding Bond Hedge and Warrants are intended to limit the earnings dilution that our stockholders would experience until the Company\u2019s common stock is above approximately $309.84 per share, the strike price of the 2023 Notes warrant transactions, which represented a 100% premium over the closing price of our common stock at the time we entered into the Bond Hedge and Warrants related to the 2023 Notes. To the extent that the share price for our common stock continues to trade above the applicable exercise price of each series of Warrants related to each series of Notes, these instruments will have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the future direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the Notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading prices of the Notes.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of each of the Notes. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading prices of the Notes. In addition, the conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the Notes could depress the market price of our common stock. For example, we issued a substantial number of shares of common stock in settlement of the Warrants related to the $300 million of 0.00% convertible senior notes that were issued in June and July 2015.\nThe fundamental change provisions of the Notes and the terms of the Bond Hedge and Warrants may delay or hinder an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nThe fundamental change purchase rights allow holders of Notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. The provisions of the indenture governing the Notes requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, including certain corporate transactions such as a change in control, may result in a change in the value of the Notes. Additionally, upon certain change of control transactions, the offsetting Bond Hedge and Warrants that we entered into at the time we issued the Notes may be exercised and/or terminated early. As a result of these provisions, we may be required to make payments to, or renegotiate terms with, holders of the Notes and/or the hedge counterparties.\n42 | FORM 10-K\nPART I\nThese features of the Notes and the Bond Hedge and Warrants, including the financial implications of any renegotiation of the above-mentioned provisions, could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, our stockholders, and may result in the acquisition of us being on terms less favorable to our stockholders than it would otherwise be, or could require us to pay a portion of the consideration available in such a transaction to holders of the Notes or Warrants or the counterparties to the Bond Hedge.", "PERMNO": 86187, "SIC": 5712, "TIC": "RH"}
