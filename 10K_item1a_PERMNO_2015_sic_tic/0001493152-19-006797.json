{"cik": "1135657", "company": "Eco-Stim Energy Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-05-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a number of risks. You should carefully consider the risks described in \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d in addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our securities. These risks could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and cause the trading price of our securities to decline. You could lose part or all of your investment. You should bear in mind, in reviewing this Form 10-K, that past experience is no indication of future performance. You should read the section titled \u201cCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nOur working capital requirements, liquidity needs and indebtedness, and any indebtedness we may incur in the future, could restrict our operations, limit our ability to grow, and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions or other adverse developments.\nAny indebtedness, whether incurred in connection with acquisitions, operations or otherwise, may adversely affect our operations and limit our growth. Our obligations under the Negotiable Demand Promissory Note (the \u201cDemand Note\u201d) we executed in favor of Eco-Lender, LLC (the \u201cLender\u201d), a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of Fir Tree (the \u201cLender\u201d), are guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiary, EcoStim, Inc., and are secured by a security interest (subject to permitted liens) in substantially all of our personal property and the personal property of EcoStim, Inc., including 100% of the outstanding equity of our U.S. subsidiaries (including EcoStim, Inc.) and 65% of the outstanding equity of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate principal amount and accrued interest outstanding under the Demand Note was approximately $8.1 million. If our obligations under the Demand Note are accelerated pursuant to their respective terms, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to repay such obligations and our other obligations arising under our indebtedness or other obligations.\nOur level of indebtedness may affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or other adverse developments;\n\u25cf the covenants that are contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u25cf our debt covenants could also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n\u25cf any failure to comply with the financial or other covenants of our debt, including covenants that impose requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, could result in an event of default, which could result in some or all of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u25cf our level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; and\n\u25cf our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, and we may have difficulty making debt service payments on such indebtedness as payments become due.\nIn addition, we have incurred significant operating losses during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and incurred a consolidated net loss of $87.9 million.\nOur limited operations, limited cash flows and existing obligations to third parties could significantly limit our alternatives, and we cannot assure you that bankruptcy will not be filed.\nIn September 2018, we completed work under our pressure pumping contract with our primary U.S. customer. Given the weakness of the U.S. well stimulation market, in September 2018 we elected to suspend our U.S. well stimulation operations and significantly reduce our U.S. workforce in alignment with potential near-term opportunities, including pump down and miscellaneous pumping services. During the fourth quarter of 2018 and on into the first quarter of 2019, we conducted one pump down operation for a customer in the Permian basin. We actively pursued the sale of a substantial majority of the equipment, inventory and other operating assets relating to our U.S. operations and did not conduct any well stimulation operations in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, we do not expect that our U.S. operations will generate any material revenue in future periods unless we are able to obtain access to additional third-party capital to fund our future operations on reasonable terms or are otherwise able to consummate a strategic transaction.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses during 2018, and as of December 31, 2018, we had a working capital deficit of $5.5 million. Following the suspension of our U.S. well stimulation operations, we have sold a substantial majority of the equipment, inventory and other operating assets relating to our U.S. operations. We currently intend to use the proceeds from such sales to reduce our outstanding liabilities and improve our liquidity, however, we can provide no assurances as to our ability to successfully negotiate the resolution of outstanding creditor claims or our ability to negotiate the resolution of such claims on favorable terms. In addition, we do not have access to a working capital facility and may not have access to other sources of external capital on reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient amount of proceeds from asset sales or funds from other sources, we may not be able to satisfy our working capital requirements, indebtedness and other obligations.\nIt is possible that our Demand Note could be called or creditor claims could be asserted that result in the Company becoming party to bankruptcy filings, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. For the duration of any such bankruptcy case or cases, our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy will be subject to risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy and additional costs and expenses associated with bankruptcy. The associated risks and uncertainties include our ability to operate within the restrictions and the liquidity limitations imposed by bankruptcy; obtain bankruptcy court approval with respect to motions filed in the bankruptcy cases from time to time; develop, prosecute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization or liquidation; and fund and execute on a business plan. We would also be subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of the creditors and other third parties who have interests in the bankruptcy case that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nFollowing the third quarter of 2018, we have not provided any services to our customer in Argentina, we did not generate any material revenue from our Argentina operations in the fourth quarter of 2018, and our contemplated sale of assets in Argentina may not be consummated due to an inability to comply with our sale agreement and the legal and local administrative risks.\nIn Argentina, we have been operating under a transition agreement with our primary customer since May 2018 and continued to provide services under that agreement during the third quarter of 2018. Subsequent to the third quarter of 2018, we have not provided any services to our primary customer in Argentina under the transition agreement or otherwise, and we did not generate any revenue from our Argentina operations in October 2018. We are not currently pursuing new work in Argentina, , and we do not expect to generate any material revenue from our Argentina operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 or in future periods. As a result, our Argentina operations may require access to additional capital, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient amount of funds, we may not be able to satisfy the working capital requirements, indebtedness or other obligations of our operations in Argentina.\nThe Company has entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party to dispose of substantially all of the assets and equipment used in the Company\u2019s operations in Argentina. The transaction is closing in phases over approximately a 90 day period, subject to certain closing conditions. If these closing conditions are not met or are significantly delayed, the process of closing operations in Argentina will be delayed or terminated, resulting in additional costs and we may not be able to satisfy the working capital requirements, indebtedness or other obligations of our operations in Argentina.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to efficiently sell our assets and seek to dissolve, liquidate and wind up.\nWe intend to rely on a few individuals in key management roles as we sell our remaining assets and seek to dissolve, liquidate and wind up the Company. Loss of one or more of these key individuals could hamper the efficiency or effectiveness of these processes.\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nAlthough we have been required to incur costs and require management resources to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the past, we currently do not expect to file any further reports with the SEC. Should we be required to continue such reporting, we would need to conduct such evaluations in respect of those filings. Any failure to comply or any adverse result from such evaluation may have an adverse effect on the results of our audit.\nLegal, labor or creditor claims can cause delay and additional costs associated with the sale of assets and ultimate liquidation of the Company.\nUnresolved legal, labor or creditor claims can add additional costs and delays in our plan to sell assets and ultimately liquidate the Company. Creditor claims in the U.S. can trigger involuntary bankruptcy which could result in additional costs and delays in our plan to liquidate.\nFir Tree, in their position as majority shareholder, could call their Demand Note, and other actions that could cause the Company to be unable to make any payments to holders of common stock.\nFir Tree, as majority owner of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock, could call their Demand Note demanding payments, which could cause the Company to limit any distributions or could cause the Company to file bankruptcy protection.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nThe oil and gas industry is intensely competitive.\nThe oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and most of our potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do. Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain or improve current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers. If our competitors increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive services or decrease the prices at which they offer their services, we may be unable to compete effectively. Some of these competitors may expand or construct newer, more powerful or more flexible well stimulation fleets that would create additional competition for us. Furthermore, reductions in drilling activity in markets such as North America may drive other oilfield services companies to relocate their equipment to the regions outside the U.S. in which we operate or intend to operate. Such increase in supply relative to demand could negatively impact pricing and utilization of our services. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter markets served or proposed to be served by us, that we will be able to compete successfully, or that we will have adequate funds to compete.\nRegulatory compliance costs and restrictions, as well as delays in obtaining permits by the customers for their operations, such as for well stimulation and pressure pumping, or by us for our operations, could impair our business.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are subject to or impacted by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions in which our and their operations are located. As a result of changes in regulations and laws relating to the oil and natural gas industry, including well stimulation, our operations or the operations of our customers could be disrupted or curtailed by governmental authorities. The high cost of compliance with applicable regulations may cause customers to discontinue or limit their operations and may discourage companies from continuing development activities. As a result, demand for our services could be substantially affected by regulations adversely impacting the oil and natural gas industry.\nOur operations are subject to hazards and environmental risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry.\nHistorically, we have been a provider of well stimulation and pressure pumping services, a process involving the injection of fluids-typically consisting mostly of water and also including several chemical additives-as well as sand in order to create fractures extending from the well bore through the rock formation to enable oil or natural gas to move more easily through the rock pores to a production well. In addition, we have provided a range of services to onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production operations, consisting of, among other things, coiled tubing services. Risks inherent to our industry create the potential for significant losses associated with damage to the environment or natural resources, such as the potential for contamination of drinking water resources.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental, worker health and safety laws and regulations that may subject us to substantial liability or require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is significantly affected by stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters. The cost of compliance with these laws can be significant. Failure to properly handle, transport or dispose of these materials or otherwise conduct our operations in accordance with these and other environmental laws could expose us to substantial liability for administrative, civil and criminal penalties, cleanup and site restoration costs and liability associated with releases of such materials, damages to natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. We could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages under these and other environmental laws. Such liability can be on a strict, joint and several liability basis, without regard to fault. Liability may be imposed as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Environmental laws and regulations have changed in the past, and they are likely to change in the future. If existing environmental requirements or enforcement policies change and become more stringent, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for oil and natural gas.\nIn recent years, many national, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, in the United States, the EPA has finalized a series of greenhouse gas monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions including carbon dioxide and methane. In December 2015, the United States and Argentina participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake \u201cambitious efforts\u201d to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Agreement, which went into effect in November 2016, establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. In addition, we cannot predict what additional steps, if any, Argentina may take as a result of participation in the Paris Agreement. Argentina has also passed a number of energy-efficiency related measures as well as requirements for the blending of ethanol and other biofuels with petroleum fuels. These measures could reduce demands for petroleum products, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our services.\nMoreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our services and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather. At this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.\nNew technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. If competitors and others use or develop new technologies in the future that are more efficient or productive than ours, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe industry is affected by excess equipment inventory levels.\nBecause of the long-life nature of oilfield service equipment and the lag between when a decision to build additional equipment is made and when the equipment is placed into service, the inventory of oilfield service equipment in the industry does not always correlate with the level of demand for service equipment.\nCompliance with governmental regulations may impact our or our customers\u2019 operations and may adversely affect our ability to sell our assets.\nOur historic operations were dependent on our customers\u2019 decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate. The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells. Advanced technologies, such as horizontal drilling and well stimulation and pressure pumping, improve total recovery, but they also result in a more rapid production decline and may become subject to more stringent regulations in the future. Similarly, the market for our assets is affected by these factors.\nAccess to prospects is also important to customers for our historic services and such access may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves or because another oil and natural gas exploration company owns the rights to develop the prospect. Government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced. This could lead customers to curtail their operations and result in a decrease in demand for our assets, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to sell our assets.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives relating to well stimulation could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays for the operations of our customers.\nMany national, provincial, and local governments and agencies have adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using well stimulation. Well stimulation is a treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing cracks in the target formation. Proppant, such as sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the cracks open when the treatment is complete. In response to concerns related to potential impacts to the environment and natural resources from well stimulation, governmental authorities have issued new rules and regulations governing the practice and are also pursuing studies related to its potential effects. Also, some national, state, and local governments have adopted bans or other measures restricting well stimulation activities. For example, the Province of Neuqu\u00e9n in Argentina, where we operate, has approved a set of rules regarding the extraction of shale oil and gas. These rules require, amongst other things, that operators performing well stimulation obtain permits prior to commencing drilling activities and file reports with the provincial government regarding the chemicals used in the well stimulation process and an analysis of the flowback water returning to the surface. In certain regions, the indigenous people have voiced their opposition to the increased shale development although to date these protests have been peaceful and have yet to disrupt activity in a meaningful way. In addition, several other provinces and local governments have voted to ban well stimulation within their borders, and some groups continue to advocate for a national ban on well stimulation in Argentina. The EPA and states, including Oklahoma, have also taken steps to regulate hydraulic fracturing. There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. Legislative or regulatory changes could cause customers to incur substantial compliance costs. These factors could adversely affect customers and the market for our assets, and our historic compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business or assets of newly enacted or potential national, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.\nRisks Related to Our Operations in Argentina and Other Foreign Jurisdictions\nOur business may be impacted by economic conditions in Argentina.\nOur business may be impacted by economic conditions prevailing in Argentina. The Argentine economy has experienced significant volatility in past decades, including numerous periods of low or negative growth and high and variable levels of inflation and devaluation. If economic conditions in Argentina contract, or if the Argentine government\u2019s measures to attract or retain foreign investment and international financing in the future are unsuccessful, such developments could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nArgentine economic conditions are dependent on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) the following:\n\u25cf international demand for Argentina\u2019s principal exports;\n\u25cf international prices for Argentina\u2019s principal commodity exports;\n\u25cf stability and competitiveness of the Argentine Peso against foreign currencies;\n\u25cf levels of consumer consumption and foreign and domestic investment and financing; and\n\u25cf the rate of inflation.\nIn recent years, Argentina has confronted inflationary pressure. Increased rates of inflation in Argentina could increase our cost of operation and may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that inflation rates will not be higher in the future.\nIn addition, Argentina\u2019s economy is vulnerable to adverse developments affecting its principal trading partners. A significant decline in the economic growth of any of Argentina\u2019s major trading partners, such as Brazil, China or the U.S., could have a material adverse impact on Argentina\u2019s balance of trade and adversely affect Argentina\u2019s economic growth and may consequently adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Argentine Peso has been subject to significant devaluation in the past and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future, consequently affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows (see additionally Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - \u201cWe may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\u201d) Until we complete the sale of our business in Argentina, we remain subject to these risks.\nThe Argentinian government has fixed oil and gas prices for domestic producers. Any decrease or removal of the fixed price could result in a corresponding reduction in drilling activity in Argentina, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Argentinian government has historically fixed the price of oil and natural gas. More recently, the government has been supportive of fixed prices for natural gas but has indicated a desire to allow the oil prices to adjust to international prices. We have no assurance that the government will not lower the fixed prices for oil or natural gas in the future or remove them altogether. If the fixed price for oil or natural gas were to be reduced or removed, there may be less drilling activity in Argentina, which could have a corresponding adverse effect on the demand for our products or services.\nCertain risks are inherent in any investment in a company operating in an emerging market such as Argentina.\nArgentina is an emerging market economy and investing in emerging markets generally carries risks. These risks include political, social and economic instability that may affect Argentina\u2019s economic results which can stem from many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf high interest rates;\n\u25cf abrupt changes in currency values;\n\u25cf high levels of inflation;\n\u25cf exchange controls;\n\u25cf wage and price controls;\n\u25cf regulations to import equipment and other necessities relevant for operations;\n\u25cf changes in governmental economic or tax policies; and\n\u25cf political and social tensions.\nAny of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Argentine economy has been adversely affected by economic developments in other markets.\nFinancial and securities markets in Argentina, and the Argentine economy, are influenced by economic and market conditions in other markets worldwide. Considering the current international turmoil, Argentina\u2019s economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including those relating to or similar to the global economic crisis that began in 2008 and the more recent uncertainties surrounding European sovereign debt. Although economic conditions vary from country to country, investors\u2019 perceptions of events occurring in one country may substantially affect capital flows into and investments in securities from issuers in other countries, including Argentina.\nConsequently, there can be no assurance that the Argentine financial system and securities markets will not continue to be adversely affected by events in developed countries\u2019 economies or events in other emerging markets, which could in turn adversely affect the Argentine economy and, as a consequence, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe implementation of new export duties, other taxes and import regulations could adversely affect our results.\nChanges in export duties, taxes and import regulations may negatively affect our business, financial condition and cash flows. For example, in 2017, the Argentine government adopted an import procedure (Decree 629) which created a regime of importation of used goods in the hydrocarbon industry to expedite the importation of used equipment. We cannot assure you that these taxes and import regulations will continue or be changed in the future or that other new taxes or import regulations will not be imposed.\nWe may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nOur results of operations are exposed to currency fluctuation and any devaluation of the Argentine Peso against the U.S. dollar and other hard currencies may adversely affect our business and results of operations. The value of the Argentine Peso has fluctuated significantly in the past and may do so in the future. We are unable to predict whether, and to what extent, the value of the Argentine Peso may further depreciate or appreciate against the U.S. dollar and how any such fluctuations would affect our business.\nWe are subject to exchange and capital controls.\nIn the past, Argentina imposed exchange controls and transfer restrictions substantially limiting the ability of companies to retain foreign currency or make payments abroad. Although the Macri government lifted exchange controls and liberalized capital controls as described above, there can be no assurances regarding future modifications to exchange and capital controls. Exchange and capital controls could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to meet our foreign currency obligations and execute our financing plans.\nOperating internationally subjects us to significant risks and regulations inherent in operating in foreign countries.\nWe may conduct operations in a number of countries as part of our growth strategy. Our international operations will be subject to a number of risks inherent to any business operating in foreign countries, and especially those with emerging markets, including the following risks, among others:\n\u25cf government instability, which can cause investment in capital projects by our potential customers to be withdrawn or delayed, reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services;\n\u25cf potential expropriation, seizure, nationalization or detention of assets, such as the 2012 nationalization of Repsol S.A.\u2019s interest in YPF;\n\u25cf difficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, import/export tariffs and quotas;\n\u25cf civil uprisings, riots and war, which can make it unsafe to continue operations, adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses;\n\u25cf availability of suitable personnel and equipment, which can be affected by government policy, or changes in policy that limit the importation of qualified crewmembers or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient;\n\u25cf decrees, laws, regulations, interpretation and court decisions under legal systems, which are not always fully developed and which may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and/or unrecoverable costs as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs; and\n\u25cf terrorist attacks, including kidnappings of our personnel.\nWe cannot predict the nature and the likelihood of any such events. However, if any of these or other similar events should occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flow.\nCertain of the equipment that we use in certain foreign countries may require prior U.S. government approval in the form of an export license and may otherwise be subject to tariffs and import/export restrictions. The delay in obtaining required governmental approvals could affect our ability to timely commence a project, and the failure to comply with all such controls could result in fines and other penalties.\nWe may be subject to taxation in many foreign jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide. Our tax returns will be subject to routine examination by taxing authorities, and these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest.\nOur overall success as an international company may depend, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social and political conditions. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nOur international operations involve the use of foreign currencies, which subjects us to exchange rate fluctuations, difficulty in repatriating foreign currencies and other currency risks.\nWe and our foreign subsidiaries from time to time will hold foreign currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations will subject us to currency risk as well as to other risks sometimes associated with international operations. In the future, we could experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside the U.S., and there can be no assurance that payments received in foreign currencies can be repatriated to the U.S. or that we will be able, contractually or otherwise, to reduce the currency risks associated with our international operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-bribery laws.\nThe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making, offering or authorizing improper payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries or regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.\nAs a company subject to compliance with the FCPA, our business may suffer and we may be subject to competitive disadvantages because our efforts to comply with U.S. laws could restrict our ability to do business in foreign markets relative to our competitors who are not subject to U.S. law. Additionally, our business plan involves establishing close relationships with stakeholders in certain foreign markets. Any determination that we or foreign shareholders, directors or officer\u2019s partners have violated the FCPA may adversely affect our business and operations.\nViolations of anti-bribery laws (either due to our acts or our inadvertence) may result in criminal and civil sanctions and could subject us to other liabilities in the U.S. and elsewhere. Even allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increased costs and risks as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with most, but not all, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), as well as rules and regulations implemented by the SEC. Changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of SOX and rules adopted by the SEC, have resulted in, and will continue to result in, increased costs to us as we respond to these requirements. Given the risks inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting is uncertain. If our internal controls are not designed or operating effectively, we may not be able to issue an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required. Investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and which could affect our ability to run our business as we otherwise would like to. New rules could also make it more difficult or costlier for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the coverage that is the same or similar to our current coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, the committees of our Board, and as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the total amount of the costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with these rules and regulations.\nCompliance with SOX requirements will continue to strain our limited financial and management resources.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our status as a reporting public company. SOX and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have imposed various requirements on public companies, including corporate governance practices. As such, our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, SOX requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure of controls and procedures. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 of SOX requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWe may continue to incur costs and expenses that will reduce any amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nClaims, liabilities and expenses, severance payments, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, income, payroll foreign, state and local taxes, legal, accounting and consulting fees and general and administrative expenses, will continue to be incurred by us as we sell our remaining assets and prepare to wind down. We can only estimate the aggregate amount of these expenses, but these expenses will reduce the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders.\nWe may continue to incur costs and expenses if we are unable to cease to file our annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC.\nBecause of the costs associated with preparing and filing our annual, quarterly and current reports under applicable securities laws, we intend to take actions to terminate or suspend our ongoing reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. Specifically, the Nasdaq filed a Notification of Removal from the Listing and/or Registration on Form 25 with the SEC on February 26, 2019 to remove the common stock listing on Nasdaq and withdraw the common stock from registration under Section 12(b) pursuant to Rule 12d2-2(b) of the Exchange Act. Pursuant to Rule 12d2-2(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, the application on Form 25 became effective with respect to the delisting of the common stock ten (10) days after the Form 25 was filed with the SEC. The Company has implemented a reverse stock split which reduced the number of shareholders of record. This allows the Company to deregister the common stock and reduce ongoing expenses with respect to filings under the Exchange Act. After the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and the filing of Form 15 to suspend the Company\u2019s reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, we expect that the Company will no longer be subject to certain provisions of the Exchange Act. However, if we are required to continue to file annual, quarterly or current reports with the SEC, or if we again become subject to such reporting obligations, we will continue to incur the associated costs and expenses, which are substantial.\nFir Tree may have significant influence over us, including influence over decisions that require stockholder approval, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Fir Tree beneficially owned approximately 76.1% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, Fir Tree currently has the right to nominate up to a total of three individuals to the Board. As a result, Fir Tree has influence over our decisions to take certain corporate actions including those specified in the Amended and Restated Stockholder Rights Agreement we have entered into with Fir Tree and certain other stockholders (the \u201cA&R Stockholder Rights Agreement\u201d).\nMoreover, Fir Tree has a contractual right to maintain its percentage ownership in our Company. Specifically, under the terms of the A&R Stockholder Rights Agreement, for so long as Fir Tree beneficially owns more than 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock (calculated on a fully diluted basis), Fir Tree, subject to certain exclusions, has a preemptive right to purchase up to the amount of any new securities we propose to issue or sell as is necessary to maintain Fir Tree\u2019s percentage ownership of us. As a result, Fir Tree\u2019s preemptive right will apply to any securities we issue during an underwritten public offering. Therefore, while other holders of our stock would risk suffering a reduction in percentage ownership in connection with a new issuance of securities by us, Fir Tree would, through this preemptive right, have the opportunity to avoid a reduction in percentage ownership. As long as Fir Tree continues to hold a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, it will have the ability to influence the vote in any election of directors and over decisions that require stockholder approval. Please read Part III - Item 13 - \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nWe could become subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares of stock in our company.\nSEC regulations generally define \u201cpenny stocks\u201d as equity securities that have a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. As of December 31, 2018, the closing price for our common stock were $0.065 per share. Although we currently meet the net tangible assets and/or the minimum revenue exemptions from the \u201cpenny stock\u201d definition, no assurance can be given that such exemption will be maintained. If we lose the exemption, our common stock may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, which regulations are commonly referred to as the \u201cPenny Stock Rules.\u201d The Penny Stock Rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers prior to selling penny stocks, which may make it burdensome to conduct transactions in our shares. If our shares become subject to the Penny Stock Rules, it may be difficult to sell shares of our stock, and because it may be difficult to find quotations for shares of our stock, it may be impossible to accurately price an investment in our shares. There can be no assurance that our common stock will continue to qualify for an exemption from the Penny Stock Rules. In any event, even if our common stock continues to remain exempt from the Penny Stock Rules, we remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of a penny stock if the SEC determines that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\nPreferences exist that would prioritize certain shareholders in the event of a Company liquidation, winding-up or dissolving of the Company.\nEach share of Series A Preferred ranks senior to the Company\u2019s common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company and has a stated value of $1,000 per share (the \u201cStated Value\u201d). In the event the Company is liquidated, wound up or dissolved, or if the Company effects any Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined below), the holders of Series A Preferred are entitled to receive in respect thereof the greater of (i) the Stated Value plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, (ii) the amount the holder thereof would receive if such shares of Series A Preferred were converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution, winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event or (iii) a liquidating distribution equal to 1.5 times the Stated Value. A \u201cDeemed Liquidation Event\u201d includes certain merger or consolidation transactions, a sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, a change of control transaction or similar event.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15290, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "ESESQ"}
