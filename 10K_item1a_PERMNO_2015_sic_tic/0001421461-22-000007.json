Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock. We may be subject to other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nSummary Risk Factors\nBelow is a summary of some of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, disrupt our business, including, among other things, demand for our products, our personnel and production processes, each of which has and could continue to materially affect our operations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our potash sales are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\n\u2022We are working to expand our sales of Trio\u00ae, and our sales and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in our plans.\n\u2022We may not be successful in our efforts to sustain or expand water sales due to the status of our water rights, challenges to our water rights, changes in the demand for water in the areas around our facilities, or other events, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022A decline in oil and gas drilling or a reduction in the use of potash in drilling fluids could decrease our revenue.\n\u2022We may alter or expand our operations or continue to pursue acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business if we are unable to manage any expansion or acquisition effectively.\n\u2022Aggressive pricing or operating strategies by our competitors could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\n\u2022The seasonal demand for our products, and the resulting variations in our cash flows from quarter to quarter, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and working capital requirements.\n\u2022Our Trio\u00ae profitability could be affected by market entrants or the introduction of langbeinite alternatives.\n\u2022International sales could present risks to our business.\n\u2022If potash or Trio\u00ae prices decline, or oil and gas activity declines, we could be required to record write-downs of our long-lived and indefinite-lived assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022If we are required to write down the value of our inventories, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n\u2022Weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could lead to lower domestic potash prices, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Currency fluctuations could cause our results of operations to fluctuate.\n\u2022Our business depends on skilled and experienced workers, and our inability to find and retain quality workers could have an adverse effect on our development and results of operations.\n\u2022Increases in the prices of energy and other important materials used in our business, or disruptions to their supply, could adversely impact our sales, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\u2022Increased costs could affect our per-ton profitability.\n\u2022A shortage of railcars or trucks for transporting our products, increased transit times, or interruptions in railcar or truck transportation could result in customer dissatisfaction, loss of sales, higher transportation or equipment costs, or disruptions in production.\n\u2022We rely on our management personnel for the development and execution of our business strategy, and the loss of one or more members of our management team could harm our business.\n\u2022We have less product diversification than nearly all of our competitors, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Heavy precipitation or low evaporation rates at our solar solution mines could impact our potash production at those facilities, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\n\u2022Inflows of water into our langbeinite mine from heavy rainfall or groundwater could result in increased costs and production downtime and could require us to abandon the mine, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022A significant disruption to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\u2022Our business may be adversely affected by union activities.\n\u2022We will be subject to a number of uncertainties while we pursue the initial public offering of Intrepid Acquisition Corporation I (\u201cIACI\u201d), and during the timeframe when IACI pursues an initial business combination, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\n\u2022Changes in the agricultural industry could exacerbate the cyclical nature of the prices and demand for our products or adversely affect the markets for our products.\n\u2022Mining is a complex process that frequently experiences production disruptions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022Mining is a hazardous process, and accidents could result in significant costs or production delays.\n\u2022The grade of ore that we mine could vary from our projections due to the complex geology and mineralogy of reserves, which could adversely affect our production and our results of operations.\n\u2022If the assumptions underlying our reserve estimates are inaccurate or if future events cause us to negatively adjust our previous assumptions, the quantities and value of our reserves, and in turn our financial condition and results of operations, could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Existing and further oil and gas development in the Designated Potash Area could impair our potash reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022The mining business is capital intensive, and our inability to fund necessary or desirable capital expenditures could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability.\nRisks Related to Financial Position, Indebtedness and Additional Capital Needs\n\u2022The execution of strategic projects could require more time and money than we expect, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022Future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business.\n\u2022Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may incur more debt and undertake additional obligations. Incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition.\n\u2022The phase out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") could adversely affect our financial results.\n\u2022Adverse conditions in the global economy and disruptions in the financial markets could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022Market upheavals due to military actions, terrorist attacks, other catastrophic events, or economic repercussions from those events could reduce our sales or increase our costs.\nRisks Related to Compliance, Regulatory and Legal\n\u2022Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business, or changes in enforcement practices, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022If we are unable to obtain and maintain the required permits, governmental approvals, and leases necessary for our operations, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Anti-corruption laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability and require us to incur costs.\nRisks Related to the Environment and Climate\n\u2022Physical effects of climate change, and climate change legislation, could have a negative effect on us and our customers, and, in turn, our results of operations.\n\u2022Environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability and require us to incur additional costs.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022The price of our common stock may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\u2022The market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the future issuance and sale of additional shares of our common stock, or by our announcement that the issuances and sales may occur.\n\u2022We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock.\n\u2022Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.\n\u2022We may issue additional securities, including securities that are senior in right of dividends, liquidation, and voting to our common stock, without your approval, which would dilute your existing ownership interests.\n\u2022If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, disrupt our business, including, among other things, demand for our products, our personnel and production processes, each of which has and could continue to materially affect our operations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has, and could continue to, negatively affect our operations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. During 2020, measures designed to contain the spread of COVID-19 had a negative impact on the global economy. Oil demand decreased and, as a result, we saw a significant decline in oil and gas activity near our Carlsbad, New Mexico operations. We experienced a significant decrease in the sale of water and other oilfield related products and services, which negatively impacted our overall results. During 2021, many of these restrictions were reduced or removed and overall economic activity and our financial results improved. The situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change, including, but not limited to, changes that may materially affect the demand for our products, our mining operations, and the operations of our customers and supply chain partners. These changes could result in material negative effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity position and ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants.\nOur efforts to manage and mitigate the risks may be unsuccessful, and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control, including the duration and severity of COVID-19 and related variants, the efficacy and adoption of vaccines against COVID-19 and related variants, as well as third party actions taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 and related variants and mitigate public health effects. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate impact of COVID-19. The full extent of the impact and effects of COVID-19 on our future business, operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations remain uncertain at this time.\nOur potash sales are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe market for potash is cyclical, and the prices and demand for potash can fluctuate significantly. Periods of high demand, increasing profits, and high-capacity utilization lead to new plant investment and increased production. This growth continues until the market is over-saturated, leading to decreased prices and lower-capacity utilization until the cycle repeats. Global productive capacity remains higher than demand and we expect this will last for at least the next few years, although individual potash producers have, at times, independently suspended production in response to market outlook. As a result of these factors, the prices and demand for potash can be volatile. This volatility can reduce profit margins and negatively affect our results of operations. We sell most of our potash into the spot market in the U.S. In addition, there is no active hedge market for potash as there is for many other commodities. As a result, we do not have protection from this price and demand volatility.\nWe are working to expand our sales of Trio\u00ae, and our sales and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in our plans.\nOne of our strategies is to continue to expand our sales of Trio\u00ae in domestic and select international markets. Our expansion efforts may not be successful, which would temper any Trio\u00ae sales growth. With respect to international sales, it is difficult to determine if or how international demand and pricing for Trio\u00ae may develop. Our international sales often result in lower gross margins than domestic sales due to higher costs. These costs could include higher transportation costs, importation costs, and costs associated with duties, trade requirements, or other import or export control laws and regulations. We also face price pressure and competition in some international markets where substitutes are more prevalent. Any of these items could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, international sales may occur on an irregular basis, which could cause volatility in our inventories and our results of operations. See also \"International sales could present risks to our business.\"\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to sustain or expand water sales due to the status of our water rights, challenges to our water rights, changes in the demand for water in the areas around our facilities, or other events, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have permitted, licensed, declared and partially adjudicated water rights in New Mexico under which we sell water primarily for industrial uses such as in the oil and gas services industry. We continue to work to expand sales of water, especially to support oil and gas development in the Permian Basin near our New Mexico facilities. If there are changes in state or federal regulations regarding oil and gas production or water usage, this could materially impact our ability to monetize our water rights. Third parties regularly challenge our applications to the OSE to change our water rights permits so that we authorized to sell water to oil and gas producers. We may not be successful in our efforts to obtain the requisite permit changes. In many cases, sales of water require governmental permits or approvals. A decision to deny, delay, revoke, or modify a permit or approval could prevent us from selling water, increase the cost to provide water, or result in our having to refund\nprepayments that we have received for future water sales. If oil or gas prices decline, if oil and gas development in the Permian Basin decreases, or if demand for fresh water in the Permian Basin declines for other reasons, the demand for water under our water rights could be adversely affected. In addition, we could be required to expend capital to meet customer needs. Any of these events could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWater rights in New Mexico are subject to a stated place of withdrawal, purpose and place of use. Some of our water right permits, declarations and licenses were originally issued for uses relating to our mining operations. To sell water under these rights for oil and gas development, we must apply for a permit from the OSE to change the point of diversion, purpose and/or place of use of the underlying water rights. The OSE reviews such applications and makes a determination as to the validity of the right and, will approve the proposed change if it determines the requested change will not impair existing water rights, will not be contrary to the conservation of water within the state, and will not be detrimental to the public welfare of the state. In some situations, the OSE can issue a preliminary authorization for the change, which allows for the proposed change to go into effect immediately while pending further administrative review. Such authorizations for water sales are often subject to repayment if the underlying water rights were ultimately found to be invalid. Third parties may protest an application to change a point of diversion, purpose or place of use or a preliminary authorization at minimal cost and frequently do so. Once protested, an administrative process begins, whereby the OSE will ultimately determine if the subject application or preliminary authorization will impair existing water rights, will be contrary to the conservation of water within the state or will be detrimental to the public welfare of the state. The OSE\u2019s findings can be appealed to a New Mexico district court. A significant portion of our water sales are being made under preliminary authorizations issued by the OSE. Additionally, some of our water rights are permitted water rights for which we still need to provide proof of completion of works and proof of beneficial use to the OSE. Please see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an update on challenges to our water rights.\nWe may face political and regulatory issues relating to the potential use of the maximum amount of our rights. Any decrease in our water rights could materially impact our ability to monetize our water rights.\nA decline in oil and gas drilling or a reduction in the use of potash in drilling fluids could decrease our revenue.\nA portion of our revenue comes from the sale of water and potassium chloride for use in oil and gas development. A decline in oil and gas drilling, especially in the Permian Basin, could reduce our sales of water and potassium chloride. For example, the decline in oil and gas drilling in 2020 due to restrictions implemented by local, state and federal authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impacts of these restrictions on the global economy as a whole, reduced our sales of water and potassium chloride into industrial markets in 2020. In addition, oil and gas developers are regularly looking for ways to use more produced, or recycled, water instead of fresh water in oil and gas development. Also, there are other products available that have some of the same clay-inhibiting properties as our potassium chloride. These alternative products could temporarily or permanently replace some of our sales of water or potassium chloride. We also have other oilfield product and service offerings, such as caliche and brine products, the sales of which were negatively impacted by the decline in oil and gas development in 2020, and may be further impacted in the future by declines in oil and gas development.\nWe may alter or expand our operations or continue to pursue acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business if we are unable to manage any expansion or acquisition effectively.\nWe continue to look for opportunities designed to maximize the value of our existing assets, such as through increased production and sales of water, salt, and brine. For example, in 2019 we purchased water and real property assets in southeastern New Mexico, which we refer to as Intrepid South, in an effort to expand our water sales and other revenue from the oil and gas industry. In addition, we may enter into new or complementary businesses that expand our product offerings beyond our existing assets, which may include leveraging our existing oil and gas businesses in southeast New Mexico and expand into additional oil and gas midstream and upstream activities. For instance, as part of this strategy, in May 2020, we acquired an 11% equity stake in the W.D. Von Gonten Laboratories, a global industry leader in drilling and completion chemistry and a strong supporter of the use of potassium chloride in oil and gas drilling and completion activities. We may also expand into new products or services in our current industry or other industries. However, we may not ultimately be successful in implementing any alteration or expansion initiatives. Further, we may not be able to fully realize any anticipated benefits of these initiatives. Any expansion initiatives may require significant capital investments and those investments may not produce the expected benefits\nAs part of this growth strategy, we may consider the acquisition of other companies or assets that complement or expand our business. We may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain necessary financing, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets into our existing operations, or expand into new markets. An acquisition may require us to use a significant portion of available cash or may result in significant dilution to our stockholders. We may be required to assume unanticipated liabilities or contingencies as part of an acquisition, or we may face substantial costs, delays, or other problems as part of the integration process. In addition, acquired businesses or assets may not achieve the desired\neffects or otherwise perform as we expect. We may not realize the synergies that we expect to achieve. Additionally, while we execute these acquisitions and related integration activities, our attention may be diverted from our ongoing operations, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nAny of these items could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAggressive pricing or operating strategies by our competitors could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nThe potassium-fertilizer industry is concentrated, with a small number of producers accounting for the majority of global production. Many of these producers have significantly larger operations and more resources than we do. These larger producers may have greater leverage in pricing negotiations with customers and transportation providers. They also have a broader product portfolio, which may allow them to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage. They may also be able to mine their potash or langbeinite at a lower cost due to economies of scale or other competitive advantages. In addition, they may decide to pursue aggressive pricing or operating strategies that disrupt the global and U.S. markets. These disruptions could cause lower prices or demand for our product, which would adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nThe seasonal demand for our products, and the resulting variations in our cash flows from quarter to quarter, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and working capital requirements.\nThe fertilizer business is seasonal. With respect to domestic sales, we typically experience increased sales during the North American spring and fall application seasons. The degree of seasonality can change significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns. We and our customers generally build inventories during low-demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during high-demand periods, resulting in increased working capital requirements just before the start of these seasons. If we are unable to accurately predict the timing of demand for our products due to variations in seasonality from year to year, our results of operations and working capital could be adversely affected. Similarly, if we do not have adequate storage capacity to manage varying inventory needs, we may need to reduce production or lower the price at which we sell product, either of which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn mid-2016, we transitioned our East mine to Trio\u00ae-only, resulting in an increased supply of Trio\u00ae. Previously, Trio\u00ae was supply-constrained, which meant that we did not see as much seasonality with respect to purchases as we did for potash. As purchasers have gained increased confidence in our ability to supply this product closer to the traditional spring application season in the U.S., these purchasers have moved to more of a just-in-time purchasing model. As a result, we now experience more traditional seasonality with respect to our domestic Trio\u00ae sales, which exposes us to inventory and demand risks similar to those with respect to our potash.\nWe market Trio\u00ae in various countries around the world, all of which have different climates and fertilizer-application patterns. As a result, seasonality in our international Trio\u00ae sales may develop, which could cause volatility in our results of operations.\nOur Trio\u00ae profitability could be affected by market entrants or the introduction of langbeinite alternatives.\nLangbeinite is produced by us and one other company from a single resource located in Carlsbad, New Mexico. Additional competition in the market for langbeinite and comparable products exists and could increase in the future. Other companies could seek to create and market chemically similar alternatives to langbeinite, some of which could be superior to langbeinite, or less costly to produce. In addition, companies sometimes blend several nutrients to obtain a product with similar agronomic benefits as langbeinite. The market for langbeinite and our Trio\u00ae sales could be affected by the success of these and other products that are competitive with langbeinite, which could adversely affect the viability of our Trio\u00ae business and our results of operations and financial condition. Further, recent increases in the supply of langbeinite by us and the other producer may continue to pressure the sales price of Trio\u00ae.\nInternational sales could present risks to our business.\nSales of Trio\u00ae into international markets often require more resources and management attention than domestic sales and may subject us to economic, regulatory, and political risks that are different from those in the United States. These risks include accounts receivable collection; the need to adapt marketing and sales efforts for specific countries; new and different sources of competition; disputes and losses associated with overseas shipping; tariffs, export controls, and trade duties; additional time and effort to obtain product certifications; adverse tax consequences; restrictions on the transfer of funds; changes in legal and regulatory requirements or import policies; compliance with potentially unfamiliar local laws and customs; and political and economic instability. International sales may also be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the price of our products outside the United States and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Certain\ninternational markets require significant time and effort on the part of management to develop relationships and gain market acceptance for our products. Overall, there are additional logistical requirements associated with international sales, which may increase the time between production and our ability to recognize related revenue. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall business.\nIf potash or Trio\u00ae prices decline, or oil and gas activity declines, we could be required to record write-downs of our long-lived and indefinite-lived assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is considered to exist if an asset's total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the related asset. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the discounted estimated future cash flows.\nWe also have certain indefinite-lived intangible assets that we evaluate for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value may have changed. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the current fair value of the asset.\nAlthough we believe the carrying values of our long-lived and indefinite-lived assets were realizable as of the balance sheet dates, future events could cause us to conclude otherwise. These future events could include further significant and sustained declines in potash or Trio\u00ae prices, further significant or sustained declines in water prices and demand, or higher production and operating costs. Further, based on our analysis of the profitability of any of our facilities, we may decide to terminate or suspend operations at additional facilities. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of our assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are required to write down the value of our inventories, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe carry our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In periods when the market prices for our products fall below our cost to produce them and the lower prices are not expected to be temporary, we are required to write down the value of our inventories. Any write-down of our inventory would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, possibly materially.\nWeakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar could lead to lower domestic potash prices, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Currency fluctuations could cause our results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe U.S. imports the majority of its potash, including from Canada, Russia, and Belarus. If the local currencies for foreign suppliers strengthen in comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign suppliers realize a smaller margin in their local currencies unless they increase their nominal U.S. dollar prices. Strengthening of these local currencies therefore tends to support higher U.S. potash prices as the foreign suppliers attempt to maintain their margins. However, if these local currencies weaken in comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign suppliers may lower prices to increase sales volume while again maintaining a margin in their local currency. Changes in the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies could cause our sales prices and results of operations to decrease or fluctuate significantly.\nOur business depends on skilled and experienced workers, and our inability to find and retain quality workers could have an adverse effect on our development and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled managers, engineers, and other workers. At times, we may not be able to find or retain qualified workers. In particular, the labor market around Carlsbad, New Mexico, is competitive and employee turnover is generally high. In that market, we compete for experienced workers with several other employers, including natural resource and hazardous waste facilities, oil and gas producers, and another producer of langbeinite. If we are not able to attract and retain quality workers, the development of our business could suffer, or we could be required to raise wages to keep our employees, hire less qualified workers, or incur higher training costs. These risks may be exacerbated in times when we need to reduce our workforce due to economic conditions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, in mid-2016, we idled our West mine and transitioned our East mine to Trio\u00ae-only, resulting in our laying off a significant number of skilled employees in New Mexico. This may make it more difficult for us to re-hire skilled employees in the future.\nIncreases in the prices of energy and other important materials used in our business, or disruptions to their supply, could adversely impact our sales, results of operations, or financial condition.\nNatural gas, electricity, chemicals, diesel, and gasoline are key materials that we purchase and use in the production of our products. The prices of these commodities are volatile.\nOur sales and profitability are impacted by the price and availability of these materials. A significant increase in the price of these materials that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our products, or an extended interruption in the supply of these materials to our production facilities, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, high natural gas or other fuel costs could increase input costs for end-users of our products, which could cause them to spend less on our products.\nIncreased costs could affect our per-ton profitability.\nA substantial portion of our operating costs is comprised of fixed costs that do not vary based on production levels. These fixed costs include labor and benefits, base energy usage, property taxes, insurance, maintenance expenditures, and depreciation. Any increase in fixed costs or decrease in production generally increases our per-ton costs and correspondingly decreases our per-ton operating margin. We operate our East Plant at less than full capacity in order to curtail our Trio\u00ae production to match expected demand and manage inventory levels. A significant increase in costs at any of our facilities could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows, particularly during periods of lower potash and Trio\u00ae prices.\nA shortage of railcars or trucks for transporting our products, increased transit times, or interruptions in railcar or truck transportation could result in customer dissatisfaction, loss of sales, higher transportation or equipment costs, or disruptions in production.\nWe rely heavily upon truck and rail transportation to deliver our products to our customers. In addition, the cost of transportation is an important component of the price of our products. A shortage of trucks or railcars for carrying product or increased transit times due to accidents, highway or railway disruptions, congestion, high or compressed demand, labor disputes, adverse weather, natural disasters, changes to transportation systems, or other events could prevent us from making timely delivery to our customers or lead to higher transportation costs. As a result, we could experience customer dissatisfaction or a loss of sales. Similarly, disruption within the transportation systems could negatively affect our ability to obtain the supplies and equipment necessary to produce our products. We may also have difficulty obtaining access to vessels to deliver our products to overseas customers.\nWe rely on our management personnel for the development and execution of our business strategy, and the loss of one or more members of our management team could harm our business.\nOur management personnel have significant relevant industry and company-specific experience. Our senior management team has developed and implemented first-of-their-kind processes and other innovative ideas that are important to our business. If we are unable to retain these individuals, our operations could be disrupted and we may be unable to achieve our business strategies and grow effectively. We do not currently maintain \"key person\" life insurance on any of our management personnel.\nWe have less product diversification than nearly all of our competitors, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue comes from the sale of potash and langbeinite, whereas nearly all of our competitors are diversified, primarily into nitrogen- or phosphate-based fertilizer businesses or other chemical or industrial businesses. In addition, a majority of our sales are to customers in the U.S., and generally these customers are concentrated in key geographies where we have a freight advantage. As a result, we could be impacted more acutely by factors affecting our industry or the regions in which we operate than we would if our business was more diversified and our sales more global. A decrease in the demand for potash and langbeinite would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, in periods when production exceeds demand, the price at which we sell our potash and langbeinite and our sales volumes would likely fall, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition more than our diversified competitors.\nHeavy precipitation or low evaporation rates at our solar solution mines could impact our potash production at those facilities, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nAll of our potash production comes from our solar solution mines. These facilities use solar evaporation ponds to form potash crystals from brines. Weather conditions at these facilities could negatively impact potash production. For example, heavy rainfall in September and October, just after the evaporation season ends, can reduce the amount of potash we produce in that year or the following year by causing the potash crystals to dissolve and consume pond capacity. Similarly, lower-than-average temperatures or higher-than-average seasonal rainfall would reduce evaporation rates and therefore impact production. We experienced significant rainfall in the summer of 2019 at our Wendover facility which reduced the product available for sale in 2020, and at our HB facility in the summer of 2021, which led to fewer tons available for sale in the second half of 2021 and we expect will result in fewer tons than our historical average available in the spring of 2022. If we experience heavy rainfall or low evaporation rates at any of our solar solution mines, we would have less potash available for sale, and our\nsales and results of operations would be adversely affected. Reduced potash available for sale could also affect our ability to produce and sell byproducts such as salt and magnesium chloride.\nInflows of water into our langbeinite mine from heavy rainfall or groundwater could result in increased costs and production downtime and could require us to abandon the mine, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nMajor weather events such as heavy rainfall can result in water inflows into our underground, langbeinite mine. The presence of water-bearing strata in many underground mines carries the risk of water inflows into the mines. If we experience water inflows at our langbeinite mine, our employees could be injured and our equipment and mine shafts could be seriously damaged. We could be forced to shut down the mine temporarily, potentially resulting in significant production delays, and spend substantial funds to repair or replace damaged equipment. Inflows may also destabilize the mine shafts over time, resulting in safety hazards for employees and potentially leading to the permanent abandonment of the mine.\nA significant disruption to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on a variety of information technology and automated operating systems to manage or support our operations. In particular, we depend on our information technology systems for a variety of functions, including, but not limited to, financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and email. We also have access to, and we create and store, sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our employees. The proper functioning of these systems and the security of this data is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. In addition, these systems could require modifications or upgrades as a result of technological changes or growth in our business. These changes could be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. Our systems, and those of third-party providers, also could be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, viruses or malware, physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized access, and cyber-attacks. Although we take steps to secure our systems and electronic information, these cybersecurity measures may not be adequate. Any security breaches could compromise our networks and the information stored on them could be improperly accessed, disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation or our relationships with our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, and operating results.\nOur business may be adversely affected by union activities.\nHourly employees at our Wendover facility are represented by a labor union. These employees represent approximately 9% of our workforce. Our current collective bargaining agreement with the union expires on May 31, 2023. Although we believe that our relations with our unionized employees are good, we may not be successful in negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement as a result of general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, political, and other factors beyond our control. Any new agreement could result in a significant increase in our labor costs. In addition, a breakdown in negotiations or failure to timely enter into a new collective bargaining agreement could materially disrupt our Wendover operations.\nFrom time to time, efforts have been made to unionize employees at our other facilities. Additional unionization efforts could disrupt our business, consume management attention, or increase our operating costs. In addition, if these efforts were successful, we could experience increased labor costs, an increased risk of work stoppages, and limits on our flexibility to run our business in the most efficient manner to remain competitive.\nWe will be subject to a number of uncertainties while we pursue the initial public offering of Intrepid Acquisition Corporation I (\u201cIACI\u201d), and during the timeframe when IACI pursues an initial business combination, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nWhile we have announced our intention to pursue an initial public offering of IACI, a newly formed special purpose acquisition company (\u201cSPAC\u201d) and our indirect subsidiary, there has recently been heightened regulatory focus on SPACs, including recently issued accounting guidance, resulting in substantial uncertainty in the SPAC markets. Pursuing the initial public offering of a SPAC in this uncertain environment has resulted in, and may continue to result in, additional costs as instrument terms are reevaluated, delays in the SPAC initial public offering process and attention from our management and employees. There is no assurance that we will be able to consummate IACI\u2019s initial public offering on favorable terms or at all. Further, in the event the initial public offering of IACI is completed, the accounting guidance applicable to SPACs could subsequently be revisited, potentially necessitating restatements of IACI\u2019s financial statements, which could then impact and necessitate restatements of our financial statements, as well as leading to delays as IACI pursues a suitable business transaction and requiring us to devote extensive management and employee attention and resources to these matters.\nIf we are unable to consummate IACI\u2019s initial public offering on favorable terms or at all, or if we complete the initial public offering and IACI is unable to consummate a suitable business transaction during the prescribed time period set forth in the terms of IACI\u2019s initial public offering, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our stockholders. In addition, in the event that IACI is able to find a suitable initial business combination, or if the initial business combination is unsuccessful, there is no assurance that we will realize the anticipated value from such transaction. Further, we will be required to devote significant management and employee attention and resources to matters relating to the initial public offering and the initial business combination. These matters have the potential to disrupt us from conducting business operations or pursuing other business strategies and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nChanges in the agricultural industry could exacerbate the cyclical nature of the prices and demand for our products or adversely affect the markets for our products.\nFarmers attempt to apply the optimum amounts of fertilizer to maximize their economic returns. A farmer's decision about the application rate for each fertilizer, or the decision to forgo the application of a fertilizer, particularly potash and Trio\u00ae, varies from year to year depending on a number of factors. These factors include crop types, crop prices, weather patterns, fertilizer and other crop input costs, and the level of crop nutrients remaining in the soil following the previous harvest. Farmers are more likely to increase application rates of fertilizers when crop prices are relatively high, fertilizer and other crop input costs are relatively low, or the level of crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively low. Conversely, farmers are likely to reduce application of fertilizers when farm economics are weak or declining or the level of crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively high. This variability in application rates can impact the cyclical nature of the prices and demand for our products. In addition, farmers may buy and apply potash or Trio\u00ae in excess of current crop needs, which results in a build-up of potassium in the soil that can be used by crops in subsequent crop years. If this occurs, demand for our products could be delayed to future periods.\nState and federal governmental policies, including farm and ethanol subsidies and commodity support programs, may also influence the number of acres planted, the mix of crops planted, and the use of fertilizers. In addition, there are various city, county, and state initiatives to regulate the use and application of fertilizers due to various environmental concerns. If U.S. agricultural production or fertilizer use decreased significantly due to one or more of these factors, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nMining is a complex process that frequently experiences production disruptions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe process of mining is complex. Production delays can occur due to equipment failures, unusual or unexpected geological conditions, environmental hazards, acts of nature, and other unexpected events or problems. Furthermore, production is dependent upon the maintenance and geotechnical structural integrity of our tailings and storage ponds. The amounts that we are required to spend on maintenance and repairs may be significant.\nOur East mine, surface, and support facilities are over 50 years old. As mining progresses at an underground mine, operations typically move further away from the shafts and, despite modernization through sustaining capital, fixed assets may require increased repair or refurbishment. These conditions increase the exposure to higher operating costs or the increased probability of incidents.\nMining is a hazardous process, and accidents could result in significant costs or production delays.\nThe process of mining is hazardous and involves various risks and hazards that can result in serious accidents. If accidents or unforeseen events occur, or if our safety procedures are not effective, we could be subject to liabilities arising out of personal injuries or death, our operations could be interrupted, or we could be required to shut down or abandon affected facilities. Accidents could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or repair damaged facilities.\nExisting or expanded oil and gas development near our mines could result in methane gas leaking from an oil and gas well into our mines. We test our mines regularly for methane gas. However, unlike coal mines, our mines are not constructed or equipped to deal with methane gas. Any intrusion of methane gas into our mines could cause a fire or an explosion resulting in loss of life or significant property damage or could require the suspension of all mining operations until the completion of extensive modifications and re-equipping of the mine. The costs of modifying our mines and equipment could make it uneconomical to reopen our mines. You can find more information about the co-development of potash and oil and gas resources near our New Mexico facilities under the risk factor below entitled \"-Existing and further oil and gas development in the Designated Potash Area could impair our potash reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\"\nThe grade of ore that we mine could vary from our projections due to the complex geology and mineralogy of reserves, which could adversely affect our production and our results of operations.\nOre bodies have complex geology. Our production is affected by the mineral content and other mineralogy of the ore. Our projections of ore grade may not be accurate. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore grade, including many factors beyond our control. As the grade of our remaining ore reserves decreases over time, we need to process more ore to produce the same amount of saleable-grade product, increasing our costs and slowing our production. In addition, there are few opportunities to acquire more reserves in the areas around our current operations. If we are unable to process more ore to maintain current production levels, if the processing of more ore materially increases our costs, or if our ore grade projections are not accurate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf the assumptions underlying our reserve estimates are inaccurate or if future events cause us to negatively adjust our previous assumptions, the quantities and value of our reserves, and in turn our financial condition and results of operations, could be adversely affected.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating our potash and langbeinite reserves. As a result, our reserve estimates necessarily depend upon a number of assumptions, including the following:\n\u2022geologic and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and may differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine or operate\n\u2022future potash and Trio\u00ae prices, operating costs, capital expenditures, royalties, severance and excise taxes, and development and reclamation costs\n\u2022future mining technology improvements\n\u2022the effects of governmental regulation\n\u2022variations in mineralogy\nIn addition, because reserves are estimates built on various assumptions, they cannot be audited for the purpose of verifying exactness. It is only after extraction that reserve estimates can be compared to actual values to adjust estimates of the remaining reserves. If any of the assumptions that we make in connection with our reserve estimates are incorrect, the amounts of potash and langbeinite that we are able to economically recover from our mines could be significantly lower than our reserve estimates. In addition, we periodically review the assumptions underlying our reserve estimates. If future events cause us to negatively adjust our previous assumptions, our reserve estimates could be adversely affected. In any of these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nExisting and further oil and gas development in the Designated Potash Area could impair our potash reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior regulates the development of federal mineral resources-both potash and oil and gas-on federal lands in the Designated Potash Area. This 497,000-acre region outside of Carlsbad, New Mexico, includes all of our New Mexico operations and facilities. In 2012, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an updated order that provides guidance to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") and industry on the co-development of these resources.\nIt is possible that oil and gas drilling in this area could limit our ability to mine valuable potash and langbeinite reserves or mineralized deposits because of setbacks from oil and gas wells and the establishment of unminable buffer areas around oil or gas wells. It is also possible that the BLM could determine that the size of these unminable buffer areas should be larger than they are currently, which could impact our ability to mine our reserves. We review applications for permits to drill oil and gas wells as they are publicly disclosed by the BLM and the State of New Mexico. When appropriate, we protest applications for drilling permits that we believe should not be drilled consistent with the operative federal and state rules and that could impair our ability to mine our reserves or put at risk the safety of our employees. We may not prevail in these protests or be able to prevent wells from being drilled in the vicinity of our reserves. If, notwithstanding our protests and appeals, a sufficient number of wells are drilled through or near our reserves, our reserves could be significantly impaired, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe mining business is capital intensive, and our inability to fund necessary or desirable capital expenditures could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability.\nThe mining business is capital intensive. We may find it necessary or desirable to make significant capital expenditures in the future to sustain or expand our existing operations and may not have, or have access to, the financial resources to pursue these expenditures. If costs associated with capital expenditures increase or if our earnings decrease significantly or we do not have access to the capital markets, we could have difficulty funding any necessary or desirable capital expenditures at an acceptable rate or at all. This could limit the expansion of our production or make it difficult for us to sustain\nour existing operations at optimal levels. Increased costs for capital expenditures could also have an adverse effect on the profitability of our existing operations and returns from our most recent strategic projects.\nRisks Related to Financial Position, Indebtedness and Additional Capital Needs\nThe execution of strategic projects could require more time and money than we expect, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we invest in strategic projects. The completion of these projects could require significantly more time and money than we expect. In some cases, the construction or commissioning processes could force us to slow or shut down normal operations at the affected facility for a period of time, which would cause lower production volume and higher production costs per ton. In addition, our management team and other employees may be required to spend a significant amount of time addressing strategic projects, which could mean that our normal operations receive less time and attention. As we proceed with one or more of these strategic projects, we may not realize the expected benefits despite substantial investments, they may cost significantly more than we expect, or we may encounter additional risks that we did not initially anticipate.\nFuture indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under a revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to $75 million. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The agreements governing the credit facility restrict, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional indebtedness.\nFuture indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022it could limit our ability to borrow additional money or sell additional shares of common stock to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements\n\u2022it could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business\n\u2022we could be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage\n\u2022it could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy\n\u2022it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for other purposes\n\u2022it could adversely affect our business and financial condition if we default on or are unable to service our indebtedness, are unable to refinance such indebtedness on favorable terms or are unable to obtain additional financing, as needed\nOur debt agreement contains financial and other restrictive covenants. For example, the agreement includes financial covenants that require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio (as these ratios are defined under the agreement). For more information about financial covenants, see Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nThese covenants could limit our ability to engage in activities that are in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default that, if not waived, could result in the acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness. The credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. As such, an event of default could also result in our lenders foreclosing on some or all of our assets.\nThe credit facility expires in 2024. In the future, we may be unable to obtain new financing or refinancing on acceptable terms.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may incur more debt and undertake additional obligations. Incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition.\nAlthough the agreement governing our indebtedness contains restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could increase. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks to our financial condition would increase.\nWhile the agreement governing our indebtedness also contains restrictions on our ability to make loans and investments, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the investments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nThe phase out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") could adversely affect our financial results.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. LIBOR is in the process of being discontinued. While certain U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will\ncontinue to be published on the current basis until June 30, 2023, all other LIBOR settings either are no longer being published or are being published only for a limited time and only on a \u201csynthetic\u201d basis (i.e., not on the basis of submissions made by panel banks). The regulator of the administrator of LIBOR has prohibited any new use of LIBOR by firms subject to its supervision, and certain regulators in the United States have stated that no new contracts using U.S. Dollar LIBOR should be entered into after 2021. In light of these recent announcements, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist.\nAt this time, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as a more robust reference rate alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR. SOFR is calculated based on short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it is a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk, as is the case with LIBOR. SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. Because of these and other differences, there is no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have performed at any time, and there is no guarantee that it is a comparable substitute for LIBOR. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain.\nThe agreement governing our revolving credit facility is indexed to USD-LIBOR and we are monitoring this activity and evaluating the related risks. However, the consequences of the adoption of any such alternative reference rates cannot be predicted and could have an adverse impact on the amount of interest and commitment fees that we pay under the agreement governing our revolving credit facility. Likewise, the unavailability of LIBOR may have an adverse impact on interest rates and other financing costs under other debt instruments and other financial obligations of ours, as well as the market value of and the payments we receive under any LIBOR-linked securities or investments that we may own from time to time. In addition, financial markets generally may be adversely affected by the discontinuation of LIBOR, the uncertainties regarding its discontinuation, the alternative reference rates that are being or may be used in place of LIBOR and other issues related to LIBOR. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, including SOFR, or other reforms may adversely affect the trading market for LIBOR-based securities. Furthermore, we may need to renegotiate our revolving credit facility which expires on August 1, 2024 and utilizes LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, potential effect of any such event on our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot yet be determined.\nAdverse conditions in the global economy and disruptions in the financial markets could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal economic volatility and uncertainty can create uncertainty for farmers and customers in the geographic areas where we sell our products. If farmers reduce, delay, or forgo their potash and Trio\u00ae purchases due to this uncertainty, our results of operations would be adversely affected. Moreover, volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could limit our customers' ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products, which would decrease our sales volume and increase our risk of non-payment by customers. Changes in governmental banking, monetary, and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective. It is difficult to determine the extent of economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they could negatively affect our customers and business. In addition, if we are required to raise additional capital or obtain additional credit during an economic downturn, we could be unable to do so on favorable terms or at all.\nMarket upheavals due to military actions, terrorist attacks, other catastrophic events, or economic repercussions from those events could reduce our sales or increase our costs.\nActual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, military or trade disruptions, or other catastrophic events affecting the areas where we or our competitors do business could disrupt the global market for potassium-based products. As a result, our competitors may increase their sales efforts in our geographic markets and pricing of our products could suffer. If this occurs, we could lose sales to our competitors or be forced to lower our prices. In addition, due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives, local, state, and federal governments could implement new regulations impacting the production, transportation, sale, or use of potassium-based products. These new regulations could result in lower sales or higher costs.\nRisks Related to Compliance, Regulatory and Legal\nChanges in laws and regulations affecting our business, or changes in enforcement practices, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations covering a wide variety of business practices. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our operations, objectives, or reporting practices in ways that adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, or new interpretations of or enforcement practices with respect to existing laws and regulations, could similarly impact our business.\nFor example, we are subject to significant regulation under MSHA and OSHA. High-profile mining accidents could prompt governmental authorities to enact new laws and regulations that apply to our operations or to more strictly enforce existing laws and regulations. See also \u201cEnvironmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability and require us to incur additional costs.\u201d\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain the required permits, governmental approvals, and leases necessary for our operations, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe hold numerous environmental, mining, safety, and other permits and governmental approvals authorizing the operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a governmental agency to deny or delay a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could prevent or limit us from continuing our operations at the affected facility, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we could be required to expend significant amounts to obtain these permits, approvals, and leases, or we could be required to make significant capital investments to modify or suspend our operations at one or more of our facilities.\nAny expansion of our existing operations would require us to secure the necessary environmental and other permits and approvals. We may not be able to obtain these permits and approvals in a timely manner or at all. In addition, the federal government must consider and study a project's likely environmental impacts. Based on the federal government's conclusion, it could require an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement as a condition of approving a project or permit, which could result in significant time delays and costs. Furthermore, many of our operations take place on land that is leased from federal and state governmental authorities. Expansion of our existing operations could require securing additional federal and state leases. We may not be able to obtain or renew these leases on favorable terms or at all. In addition, our existing leases generally require us to commence mining operations within a specified time frame and to continue mining in order to retain the lease. The loss or non-renewal of a lease could adversely affect our ability to mine the associated reserves.\nAlso, certain of our existing leases require us to make royalty payments based on the revenue generated by the potash, langbeinite, water, or byproducts that we extract from the leased land. The royalty rates are subject to change whenever we renew our leases, which could lead to significant increases in these rates. As of December 31, 2021 approximately 20% of our state, federal and private lease acres at our New Mexico facilities (including leases at the HB and North mines) and 43% of our state and federal lease acres at our Utah operations will be up for renewal within the next five years. Increases in royalty rates would reduce our profit margins and, if the increases were significant, would adversely affect our results of operations. Reporting of royalties is subject to periodic audits by federal and state officials. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (\"ONRR\") completed their draft audit report of our New Mexico royalty reporting in September 2019. As of February 2022, we are continuing to progress on the audit in cooperation with ONRR.\nAnti-corruption laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability and require us to incur costs.\nAs a result of our international sales, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments in violation of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors even though these persons are not always subject to our control. Although we have implemented policies and training designed to promote compliance with these laws, these persons may take actions in violation of our policies. Any violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could result in significant civil or criminal penalties and have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nRisks Related to the Environment and Climate\nPhysical effects of climate change, and climate change legislation, could have a negative effect on us and our customers, and, in turn, our results of operations.\nThe prospective impact of climate change on our operations and our customers\u2019 operations remains uncertain, but the physical effects of climate change could have an adverse effect on us and our customers as experts believe that climate change may be associated with more extreme weather conditions. These effects could include, but may not be limited to, changes in regional weather patterns, including drought and rainfall levels, timing and duration of wintry precipitation and snow events,\nwater availability, sea levels, storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels, including increased volatility in seasonal temperatures via excessively hot or cold temperatures. These extreme weather conditions could vary by geographic location.\nSevere climate change could have an adverse effect on our costs, production, or sales, especially with respect to our solar operations, which require hot, arid summer weather conditions. Prolonged periods of precipitation or cooler weather during the evaporation season could reduce evaporation rates, leading to decreases in our production levels. Similarly, drought or decreased mountain snowfall and associated freshwater run-off could change brine levels, impacting our mineral harvesting process at our Wendover facility. The occurrence of these events at our solar operations could lead to decreased production levels, increased operating costs and require us to make significant additional capital expenditures. Furthermore, weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural industry and, as a result, in our results of operations, by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which can adversely affect application rates, demand for our products and our customers\u2019 creditworthiness. Weather conditions can also lead to drought or wild fires, which could adversely impact growers\u2019 crop yields and the uptake of our products, which would reduce the need for application of our products for the following planting season, which could result in lower demand for our products and negatively impact the prices of our products. Finally, salt and magnesium chloride sales into the deicing market and our ability to utilize certain water rights for sale into oil and gas markets may be adversely affected by weather conditions in our markets. Any prolonged change in weather patterns in our markets, as a result of climate change or otherwise, could have a material impact on the results of our operations. In addition, in recent years, the United States Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d). These initiatives could restrict our or our customers\u2019 operations, require us or our customers to make changes in our respective businesses that would increase our operating costs, reduce our efficiency or limit our output, require us to make capital improvements to our facilities, increase our energy, raw material and transportation costs or limit their availability, or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, it appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other regulatory initiatives are expected to be proposed that may be relevant to GHG emissions issues. In addition, a number of states are addressing GHG emissions, primarily through the development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Depending on the particular program, we and our customers could be required to control GHG emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations.\nIndependent of Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") has adopted regulations controlling GHG emissions under its existing authority under the Clean Air Act (the \u201cCAA\u201d). For example, following its findings that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment because such emissions contributed to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climate changes, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources for conventional pollutants. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified production, processing, transmission and storage facilities in the United States on an annual basis.\nFurther, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global GHG emissions, also known as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 170 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement. After previously withdrawing, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement in January 2021. Actions taken by the United States and other countries to implement the Paris Agreement or otherwise impose regulations on our industry or our customers\u2019 industries aimed at reducing GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIt is also possible that future legislation or regulation addressing climate change, including in response to the Paris Agreement or any new international agreements, could adversely affect our operations, energy, raw material and transportation costs, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, and these effects could be material or adversely impact us. In addition, to the extent climate change restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate, such as Canada, Russia, and Belarus, are less stringent than in the United States, our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us.\nWe have also made certain public statements regarding our commitment to the environment and our focus on protecting the environments, resources, and ecosystems surrounding our locations. Although we intend to work closely with communities and make it a priority to protect the natural resources surrounding our operation, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which our goals will be achieved, or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving such target and goal will meet investor expectations or legal standards, if any, regarding sustainability performance. Moreover, we may determine that it is in the best interest of our Company and our stockholders to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current plans based on economic, technological developments, regulatory and social factors, business strategy or pressure from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders. If we are unable to meet these commitments, then we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders, which\ncould adversely impact the perception of us and our products and services by current and potential customers, as well as investors, which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability and require us to incur additional costs.\nWe are subject to many environmental, safety, and health laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to mine safety, mine land reclamation, remediation of hazardous substance releases, and discharges into the soil, air, and water.\nOur operations, as well as those of our predecessors, have involved the use and handling of regulated substances, hydrocarbons, potash, salt, related potash and salt byproducts, and process tailings. These operations resulted, or may have resulted, in soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination. At some locations, salt-processing waste, building materials (including asbestos-containing material), and ordinary trash may have been disposed of or buried in areas that have since been closed and covered with soil and other materials.\nWe could incur significant liabilities under environmental remediation laws such as CERCLA with regard to our current or former facilities, adjacent or nearby third-party facilities, or off-site disposal locations. Under CERCLA and similar state laws, in some circumstances liability may be imposed without regard to fault or legality of conduct and one party may be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site. Liability under these laws involves inherent uncertainties.\nWe are also subject to federal and state environmental laws that regulate discharges of pollutants and contaminants into the environment, such as the U.S. Clean Water Act and the CAA. For example, our water disposal processes rely on dikes and reclamation ponds that could breach or leak, resulting in a possible prohibited release into the environment. Moreover, although the North and East mines in New Mexico and the Moab mine in Utah are designated as zero discharge facilities under the applicable water quality laws and regulations, these mines could experience some water discharges during significant rainfall events.\nWe expect that we will be required to continue to invest in environmental controls at our facilities and that these expenses could be significant. In addition, violations of environmental, safety, and health laws could subject us to civil and, in some cases, criminal sanctions. We could also be required to invest in additional equipment, facilities, or employees, or could incur significant liabilities, due to any of the following:\n\u2022changes in the interpretation of environmental laws\n\u2022modifications to current environmental laws\n\u2022the issuance of more stringent environmental laws\n\u2022malfunctioning process or pollution control equipment\nThe mining and processing of potash and langbeinite also generate residual materials that must be managed both during the operation of the facility and upon facility closure. For example, potash tailings, consisting primarily of salt, iron, and clay, are stored in surface disposal sites and require management. At least one of our New Mexico facilities, the HB mine, may have issues regarding lead in the tailings pile as a result of operations conducted by previous owners. During the life of the tailings management areas, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs to manage potash residual materials in accordance with environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements.\nAs a potash producer, we currently are exempt from certain State of New Mexico mining laws related to reclamation obligations. If this exemption were to be eliminated or restricted, we could be required to incur significant expenses related to reclamation at our New Mexico facilities.\nFor more information about environmental, safety and health matters affecting our business, see \"Business-Environmental, Safety, and Health Matters.\"\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility. For example, during 2021, the market price of our common stock ranged between $21.92 and $52.91. These fluctuations may continue because of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25aaour operating performance and the performance of our competitors\n\u25aathe public's reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, or filings with the SEC\n\u25aachanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who follow us or other companies in our industry\n\u25aavariations in general economic, market, and political conditions\n\u25aachanges in commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates\n\u25aasubstantial sales of common stock by us in connection with future acquisitions or capital raising activities\n\u25aaactions of our current stockholders, including sales of common stock by our directors and executive officers\n\u25aathe arrival or departure of key personnel\n\u25aaother developments affecting us, our industry, or our competitors\n\u25aathe other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nOur financial position, cash flows, results of operations, and stock price could be materially adversely affected if commodity prices decline. In addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. Our stock price may experience extreme volatility due to uncertainty regarding, among other things, commodity prices. These market fluctuations, regardless of the cause, may materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.\nOur stock is currently listed on the NYSE. For continued listing, we are required to meet specified listing standards, including a minimum stock price, market capitalization, and stockholders\u2019 equity. If we are unable to meet the NYSE\u2019s listing standards the NYSE would delist our common stock. At that point, it is possible that our common stock could be quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board or the pink sheets. This could have negative consequences, including reduced liquidity for stockholders; reduced trading levels for our common stock; limited availability of market quotations or analyst coverage of our common stock; stricter trading rules for brokers trading our common stock; and reduced access to financing alternatives for us. We also would be subject to greater state securities regulation if our common stock was no longer listed on a national securities exchange. Volatility of our common stock may make it difficult for you to resell shares of our common stock when you want or at attractive prices.\nThe market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the future issuance and sale of additional shares of our common stock, or by our announcement that the issuances and sales may occur.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions or capital raising activities, or the effect, if any, that the issuances or sales may have on the market price of our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or announcement that the issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently intend to retain earnings to reinvest for future operations and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, realization of any gain on our common stock will depend on the appreciation of the price of the shares of our common stock, which may never occur. However, our board of directors, in its discretion, may decide to declare a dividend at an appropriate time in the future, subject to the terms of our revolving credit agreement. A decision to pay a dividend would depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash requirements and the terms of our revolving credit agreement at the time a payment is considered.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various barriers to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022allow our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock without prior stockholder approval, except as may be required by NYSE rules\n\u2022do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates\n\u2022prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders\n\u2022prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders\n\u2022require vacancies and newly created directorships on the board of directors to be filled only by affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then serving on the board\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting\n\u2022classify our board of directors so that only some of our directors are elected each year\nThese provisions also may delay, prevent, or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest, or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of the common stock they own.\nWe may issue additional securities, including securities that are senior in right of dividends, liquidation, and voting to our common stock, without your approval, which would dilute your existing ownership interests.\nOur board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock or additional shares of common stock without the approval of our stockholders, except as may be required by NYSE rules. Our board of directors may approve the issuance of preferred stock with terms that are senior to our common stock in right of dividends, liquidation, or voting. Our issuance of additional common shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:\n\u2022our pre-existing stockholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease\n\u2022the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common share may diminish\n\u2022the market price of the common stock may decline\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of Intrepid or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover Intrepid downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.", "PERMNO": 92621, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "IPI"}
