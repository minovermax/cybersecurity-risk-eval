RISK FACTORS.\nDescribed below are certain risks to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the financial and other information contained in this 2021 Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, our future results could differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations for future financial performance and the trading price of our Class B common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe are subject to the auditor attestation requirement on the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting for our year ended December 31, 2021 and we and our auditors have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in this 2021 Form 10-K.\nThe Company is now subject to the requirement to include in this 2021 Form 10-K our auditor\u2019s attestation report on its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSOX\u201d). We and our auditors have identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in this 2021 Form 10-K as required under Section 404 of SOX. As some of these deficiencies are deemed material weaknesses in internal control over financing reporting, our auditors have issued an adverse opinion in their assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The issuance of an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact investor confidence in the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of our financial reports.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to effectively remediate these material weaknesses and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, investors could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for the years then ended, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have been identified:\n\u2022Information technology general controls particularly as such controls related to user access, program change management, and ineffective complementary user-organization controls, which limited management\u2019s ability to rely on technology dependent controls relevant to the preparation of our financial statements.\n\u2022Controls over the period end close process, including the review and approval process of journal entries, balance sheet account reconciliations, segregation of duties conflicts, and consolidation of intercompany entries.\n\u2022Documentation and design of controls over the recording and reconciliation of inventory.\n\u2022Review of key assumptions and estimates related to purchase accounting for significant acquisitions.\n\u2022The control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring components of the Company\u2019s internal control framework such that internal control weaknesses were not detected, communicated, addressed with mitigating control activities, or remediated in a timely manner.\nIf we are unable to effectively remediate these material weaknesses and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements.\nThe RideNow and Freedom Powersports entities we acquired were not subject to SOX regulations and they may lack the internal control over financial reporting required of a public company, which could ultimately affect our ability to ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX.\nThe RideNow and Freedom Powersports entities we acquired were not previously subject to SOX regulations and accordingly were not required to establish and maintain an internal control infrastructure meeting the standards promulgated under SOX. Our management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting and the auditor attestation, both included\nin this 2021 Form 10-K, did not include or address the internal control environment of the RideNow entities, which were acquired during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021, or the Freedom entities, which were acquired during the quarterly period ending March 31, 2022.\nWe are in the process of integrating our internal control over financial reporting and our other control environments with those of the acquired RideNow and Freedom Powersports entities. In the course of integration, we may encounter difficulties and unanticipated issues combining our respective accounting systems due to the complexity of our financial reporting processes. We may also identify errors or misstatements that could require accounting adjustments. If we are unable to integrate and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, timely or at all, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class B common stock may decline.\nPowersports consumers may not accept our transformative business model.\nAs described throughout this 2021 Form 10-K, we are transforming the traditional powersports customer experience and building the first and only true Omnichannel experience in the industry. If customers do not accept our products, services, and offerings we may not benefit from the investments needed to build this transformative customer experience to the extent anticipated or at all. Also, in building the first and only true Omnichannel experience, we expect to incur significant expenses and face various other challenges, such as expanding our customer experience team and building out a fulfillment and logistics network. Any of these risks, if realized, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to acquire the number of vehicles to satisfy consumer demand or our expectations for the business.\nA material part of our plan is predicated on being able to have sufficient inventory, both new and used, to satisfy customer demand or meet our financial objectives. New inventory is ultimately controlled by our OEMs and their willingness to allocate inventory to us and their ability to manufacture and distribute a sufficient number of vehicles given a current environment of manufacturing slowdowns, computer chip shortages, and logistic/transportation challenges (collectively, the \u201cDemand/Supply Imbalances\u201d). Used inventory is acquired directly from consumers via our online Cash Offer Tool or consumer trade-in transactions. If either channel for used vehicle acquisition were disrupted, for example as a result of another COVID-like lockdown, technology challenges, continued acceptance of online transactions, poor customer ratings, or other such events, the Company may not have enough used vehicles to meet customer demand, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have and may continue to acquire strategic retail locations and other complementary businesses and technologies, which could divert management's attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and impact our operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to the demands of consumers, other constituents within the powersports industry, and competitive pressures. In the past, we have met these demands in part by acquiring complementary businesses and technologies.\nThe identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult; time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisition opportunities. The risks we face in connection with our acquisition strategy include:\n\u2022diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022integration of the acquired company's accounting, management information, human resources, and other administrative systems;\n\u2022coordination of technology, research and development, and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022retention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u2022cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022the need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies at a business that before the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures, and policies;\n\u2022potential write-offs of intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect on our operating results in a given period; and\n\u2022liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition.\nOur failure to address these risks or other matters encountered in connection with future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or the impairment of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition.\nWe may require additional financing or capital to pursue our growth challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If financing or capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or at all, we may not be able to develop and grow our business as anticipated and our business, operating results, and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support the development and growth of our business, including expanding our inventory base and growing our RumbleOn Finance business. Additional financing or capital may not be available when we need it, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nIf we raise additional capital through issuances of equity or debt, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nInvestments made in the development, growth, and expansion of our business may not yield our expected results and may not result in successful growth of our business.\nWe expect to make significant investments in the further development and expansion of our business and these investments may not result in the development, growth or expansion of our business on a timely basis or at all. We may not generate sufficient revenue and we may incur significant losses in the future for several reasons, including a lack of demand for our products and services, increasing competition, and weakness in the powersports industry generally. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays, relating to the development and operation of our business as well as our organic and acquisition growth strategies. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully develop, grow, and expand our business, generate revenue, or achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe may experience difficulties integrating acquired businesses.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend in significant part upon our integrating any acquired entity's businesses, operations, processes and systems in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to accomplish the integration process smoothly, successfully, or on a timely basis, which may result in unforeseen expenses or the failure to recognize the anticipated benefits of acquired businesses. The necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems of controls, and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures, and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. Companies operate numerous systems and controls, including those involving management information, accounting and finance, legal and regulatory compliance, inventory intake and control, sales, billing, employee benefits, and payroll. The integration of an acquired company's operations requires the dedication of significant internal and external resources, which may divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day business of the company and be costly. Employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may also disrupt the business of the Company. Any inability of management to successfully and timely integrate an acquired company could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the Company and result in not achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nTo the extent we acquire additional businesses, we may incur substantial costs.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with our acquisitions. The substantial majority of these non-recurring costs will consist of transaction and regulatory costs related to acquisitions. We will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including system consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional\nunanticipated costs may be incurred from the acquisitions and integration. Although we anticipate that the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies and synergies related to the integration should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nWe have incurred significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect us, including our business flexibility, and will increase our interest expense.\nWe have substantially increased indebtedness following completion of the RideNow and Freedom transactions, which could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing our interest expense. We also incurred various costs and expenses related to the financing of the RideNow and Freedom transactions. The increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the RideNow and Freedom transactions, including the applicable interest payments, could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes, and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If we do not achieve the expected synergies and cost savings from the RideNow and Freedom transactions, or if our financial performance does not meet our current expectations, then our ability to service the indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success will depend on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees, including Marshall Chesrown, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, the loss of any senior management, regional directors, or key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we fail in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to annual and quarterly fluctuations, and they will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022a change in consumer discretionary spending;\n\u2022a shift in the mix and type of vehicles we sell which could result in lower sales price and lower gross profit;\n\u2022the timing and cost of development and operating activities relating to our business, which may change from time to time;\n\u2022expenditures that we will or may incur to advance our growth strategies; and\n\u2022future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies.\nIf our annual or quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price per share of our Class B common stock could fluctuate or decline substantially. We believe that annual and quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nThe failure to develop and maintain our brand could harm our ability to grow unique visitor traffic.\nDeveloping and maintaining the RumbleOn brand will depend largely on the success of our efforts to maintain the trust of and deliver value to our users. If our potential users perceive that we are not focused on providing them with a better pre-owned powersports experience, our reputation and the strength of our brand will be adversely affected.\nComplaints or negative publicity about our business practices, our marketing and advertising campaigns, our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, data privacy and security issues, and other aspects of our business, irrespective of their validity, could diminish users' confidence in and the use of our products and services and adversely affect our brand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop, maintain, or enhance our brand, and failure to do so would harm our business growth prospects and operating results.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our retail brands and reputation or to attract consumers to our own sales channels, or if events occur that damage our retail brands, reputation, or sales channels, our business and financial results may be harmed.\nOur continued success will depend on our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our retail brands across all of our sales channels, including in the communities in which we operate, and to attract consumers to our Omnichannel experience.\nConsumers are increasingly shopping for new and used vehicles, vehicle repair and maintenance services, and other vehicle products and services online and through mobile applications, including through third-party online and mobile sales platforms, with which we compete, that are designed to generate consumer sales leads that are sold to vehicle dealers. If we fail to preserve the value of our retail brands, maintain our reputation, or attract consumers to our Omnichannel offering, our business could be adversely impacted.\nAn isolated business incident at a single store could materially adversely affect our other stores, retail brands, reputation, and sales channels, particularly if such incident results in adverse publicity, governmental investigations, or litigation. In addition, the growing use of social media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared, and negative posts or comments on social media about RumbleOn, RideNow, Freedom, or any of our brands, locations, or websites could materially damage our retail brands, reputation, and sales channels.\nThe success of our business relies heavily on our marketing and branding efforts, especially with respect to the RumbleOn website and our branded mobile applications, and these efforts may not be successful.\nWe believe that an important component of our development and growth will be the business derived from the RumbleOn website and our branded mobile applications. Because RumbleOn is a consumer brand, we rely heavily on marketing and advertising to increase the visibility of this brand with potential users of our products and services.\nOur business model relies on our ability to scale rapidly and to decrease incremental user acquisition costs as we grow. Some of our methods of marketing and advertising may not be profitable because they may not result in the acquisition of sufficient users visiting our website and mobile applications such that we may recover these costs by attaining corresponding revenue growth. If we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increases in user traffic and in the number of transactions by users of our platform, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on Internet search engines to drive traffic to our website, and if we fail to appear prominently in the search results, our traffic would decline, and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on Internet search engines and social media such as Google\u2122, Bing\u2122, and Facebook\u2122 to drive traffic to our website. For example, when a user searches the internet for a particular type of powersports or recreational vehicle, we will rely on a high organic search ranking of our webpages in these search results to refer the user to our website. However, our ability to obtain such high, non-paid search result rankings is not within our control. Our competitors' Internet search engine and social media efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours, or Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings. If Internet search engines or social media companies modify their search algorithms or display technologies in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors' efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our user base could slow or our user base could decline. Internet search engine providers could provide recreation vehicle dealer and pricing information directly in search results, align with our competitors or choose to develop competing services. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website through Internet search engines could harm our business and operating results.\nA significant disruption in service on our website or of our mobile applications could damage our reputation and result in a loss of consumers, which could harm our business, brand, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract consumers, affinity groups and advertisers depend on the reliable performance of our technology infrastructure and content delivery. We may experience significant interruptions with our systems in the future. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the security or availability of our products on our website and mobile application, and prevent or inhibit the ability of consumers to access our products. Problems with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation, result in a loss of consumers, dealers and affinity group marketing partners, and result in additional costs.\nWe intend to locate our communications, network, and computer hardware used to operate our website and mobile applications at facilities in various parts of the country to minimize the risk and create an environment where we can remain online if one of the facilities in which our equipment is housed goes offline. Nevertheless, we do not own or control the operation of these facilities, and our systems and operations may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes, and similar events. The occurrence of any of these events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail.\nProblems faced by any third-party web hosting providers we may utilize could adversely affect the experience of our consumers. Any third-party web hosting providers could close their facilities without adequate notice. Any financial difficulties, up to and including bankruptcy, faced by any third-party web hosting providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. If our third-party web hosting providers are unable to keep up with our growing capacity needs, our business could be harmed.\nAny errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance or reliability problems with our network operations could cause interruptions in access to our products as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services and could harm our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to maintain or grow relationships with information data providers or may experience interruptions in the data feeds they provide, which may limit the information that we are able to provide to our users and regional partners as well as adversely affect the timeliness of such information and may impair our ability to attract or retain consumers and our regional partners and to timely invoice all parties.\nWe expect to receive data from third-party data providers, including our partner network, dealer management system data feed providers, data aggregators and integrators, survey companies, purveyors of registration data and possibly others. There may be some instances in which we use this information to collect a transaction fee from those dealers and recognize revenue from the related transactions.\nFrom time to time, we may experience interruptions in one or more data feeds that we receive from third-party data providers, in a manner that affects our ability to operate our business. These interruptions may occur for a number of reasons, including changes to the software used by these data feed providers and difficulties in renewing our agreements with third-party data feed providers. Additionally, when an interruption ceases, we may not always be able to collect the appropriate fees and any such shortfall in revenue could be material to our operating results.\nOur ability to grow our complementary product offerings may be limited, which could negatively impact our development, growth, revenue and financial performance.\nAs we introduce or expand additional offerings to our platform, such as recreation vehicle trade-ins, lead management, transaction processing, financing, maintenance and insurance, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter these markets successfully. Our expansion into these markets may place us in competitive and regulatory environments with which we are unfamiliar and involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved for several years, if at all. In attempting to establish such new product offerings, we may incur significant expenses and face various other challenges, such as expanding our sales force and management personnel to cover these markets and complying with complicated regulations that apply to these markets. In addition, we may not successfully demonstrate the value of these ancillary products to consumers or dealers, and failure to do so would compromise our ability to successfully expand into these additional revenue streams.\nWe rely on third-party financing providers to finance a portion of our customers' vehicle purchases.\nIn addition to RumbleOn Finance, our captive consumer financing entity, we rely on third-party financing providers to finance a portion of our customers' vehicle purchases. Accordingly, our revenue and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties. We provide financing to qualified customers through a number of third-party financing providers. If one or more of these third-party providers cease to provide financing to our customers, provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. Additionally, if we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party providers to supply extended protection products (\"EPP\") to our customers.\nWe rely on third-party providers to supply EPP products to our customers. Accordingly, our revenue and results of operations will be partially dependent on the actions of these third parties. If one or more of these third-party providers cease to provide EPP, make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations. Additionally, if we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations.\nOur sales of powersports vehicles may be adversely impacted by increased supply of and/or declining prices for pre-owned vehicles and excess supply of new vehicles.\nWe believe when prices for pre-owned vehicles have declined, it can have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for new vehicles (at or near manufacturer's suggested retail prices). Further, vehicle manufacturers can and do take actions that influence the markets for new and pre-owned vehicles. For example, introduction of new models with significantly different functionality, technology, or other customer satisfiers can result in increased supply of pre-owned vehicles, and a corresponding decrease in price of pre-owned vehicles. Also, while historically manufacturers have taken steps designed to balance production volumes for new vehicles with demand, those steps have not always proven effective. In other instances, manufacturers have chosen to supply new vehicles to the market in excess of demand at reduced prices which has the effect of reducing demand for pre-owned vehicles.\nWe rely on a number of third parties to perform certain operating and administrative functions for us.\nWe rely on a number of third parties to perform certain operating and administrative functions for us. We may experience problems with outsourced services, such as unfavorable pricing, untimely delivery of services, or poor quality. Also, these third parties may experience adverse economic conditions due to difficulties in the global economy that could lead to difficulties supporting our operations. In light of the amount and types of functions that we will outsource, these service provider risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe participate in a highly competitive market, and pressure from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe face significant competition from both existing powersport retailers as well as companies that provide listings, information, lead generation, and powersport-buying and selling services designed to reach businesses and consumers and enable dealers to reach these consumers and inventory sources.\nOur current and future competitors may include:\n\u2022traditional powersport dealerships that could increase investment in technology and infrastructure to compete directly with our online model;\n\u2022internet and online powersports sites that could change their models to directly compete with us, such as Amazon, eBay Motors, Google, and CycleTrader; and\n\u2022manufacturers seeking to have a direct relationship with customers or to support their dealer networks.\nWe also expect that competitors, both new and existing, will continue to enter the online and traditional powersports retail industry with competing brands, business models, products, and services, which could make it difficult to acquire inventory, attract customers, and sell vehicles at a profitable price. For example, traditional dealerships could transition their selling efforts to the internet, allowing them to more efficiently sell powersports across state lines and compete directly with our online offering and no-haggle pricing model. Some of these companies have significantly greater resources than we do and may be able to provide customers access to a greater inventory of vehicles at lower prices or purchase vehicles from consumers at higher prices while delivering a competitive overall experience.\nOur competitors may also impede our ability to reach consumers in certain jurisdictions. For example, our competitors may increase their search engine optimization efforts and outbid us for search terms on various search engines.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we have, and the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and support of their products and services. Additionally, they may have more extensive industry relationships, longer operating histories, and greater name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly with new technologies and to\nundertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns. If we are unable to compete with these companies, the demand for our used vehicles, products, and services could substantially decline.\nIn addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future data providers, technology partners, or other parties with whom we have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to develop, improve, and promote our solutions. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our revenue, business, and financial results.\nRestrictive covenants in certain of our debt agreements could limit our growth and implementation of our business strategy.\nOur debt agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) make investments or loans; (iii) create liens; (iv) consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes; (v) make restricted payments; (vi) make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries; (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates; and (viii) use of proceeds of asset sales.\nWe may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under certain of our debt agreements. The restrictions contained in the covenants could: (i) limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, to meet capital needs or otherwise to restrict our activities or business strategy; and (ii) adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or divestitures to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nA breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could result in a default under our debt agreements that, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder and cross-default rights under our other debt. In addition, in the event of an event of default under our credit facilities, the affected lenders could foreclose on the collateral securing such credit facility and require repayment of all borrowings outstanding thereunder. If the amounts outstanding under the credit facilities or any of our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the amounts owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders.\nThe phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.\nOn March 5, 2021, the administrator for LIBOR announced that it will permanently cease to publish most LIBOR settings beginning on January 1, 2022 and cease to publish the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month LIBOR settings on July 1, 2023. The replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the discontinuance of LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks. We may need to amend certain contracts or enter into new ones and cannot predict what alternative rate or benchmark would be negotiated. This may result in an increase to our interest expense.\nSeasonality or weather trends may cause fluctuations in our unique visitors, revenue and operating results.\nOur revenue trends are likely to be a reflection of consumers' vehicle buying patterns. While different types of recreation vehicles are designed for different seasons (motorcycles are typically for non-snow seasons, while snowmobiles are typically designed for winter), our revenue may be cyclical if, for example, powersport and recreation vehicles represent a large percentage of our revenue. Historically, the used vehicle industry has been seasonal with traffic and sales strongest in the spring and summer quarters. Sales and traffic are typically slowest in the fall quarter but increase in February and March, coinciding with tax refund season. Our business will also be impacted by cyclical trends affecting the overall economy, as well as by actual or threatened severe weather events.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data, and our actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and operating results.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data provided by consumers, dealers and auctions. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect secure transmission of such information. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems\ncaused by breaches. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain the security of personal and other data that is provided to us by consumers and dealers could harm our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, any of which could harm our business and operating results. In addition, from time to time, it is possible that concerns will be expressed about whether our products, services, or processes compromise the privacy of our users. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business and operating results.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storing, sharing, disclosing, using and protecting of personal information and other data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and which may be costly to comply with and may be inconsistent between countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. We generally comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent possible. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices or that new regulations could be enacted. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to consumers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause consumers and vehicle dealers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if vendors, developers or other third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put consumer or dealer information at risk and could in turn harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our business and operating results.\nA portion of our success may be dependent on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We expect to rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we will attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software, and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary.\nCompetitors may adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the term \"RumbleOn\" or \"RMBL.\"\nWe currently hold numerous Internet domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United States is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars, or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain all domain names that use the name RumbleOn or RMBL.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may from time-to-time face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors or non-practicing entities. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering some features, purchase licenses or modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes or may result in significant settlement costs.\nIn addition, we use open-source software in our products and will use open-source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims against companies that incorporate open-source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open-source software or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open-source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our platform or services, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nEven if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, our operating results and our reputation.\nWe provide transportation services and rely on external logistics to transport vehicles. Thus, we are subject to business risks and costs associated with the transportation industry. Many of these risks and costs are out of our control, and any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide transportation services and rely on external logistics to transport vehicles between and among customers or distribution network providers, and auction partners. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with the transportation industry such as weather, traffic patterns, gasoline prices, recalls affecting our vehicle fleet, local and federal regulations, vehicular crashes, insufficient internal capacity, rising prices of external transportation vendors, fuel prices, taxes, license and registration fees, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified drivers, disruption of our technology systems, and increasing equipment and operational costs. Our failure to successfully manage our logistics and fulfillment process could cause a disruption in our inventory supply chain and distribution, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nA failure to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAlthough we have been able to obtain reasonably priced insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, and increased premium costs or deductibles. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage, we would be subject to increased out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a claim and we may not be able to procure certain contracts, either of which could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on economic activity have and may continue to have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on economic activity, including lower new powersports vehicle production due to Demand/Supply Imbalances, have had adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition during the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect these conditions to continue through 2022. The effect of these Demand/Supply Imbalances required that we adjust our inventory management to align with market conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on economic activity, including the Demand/Supply Imbalances, may have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and we can provide no assurance as to the duration of the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and the Demand/Supply Imbalances.\nRisks Relating to the Powersports Retail Industry and our Retail Locations\nThe powersports retail industry is sensitive to unfavorable changes in general economic conditions and various other factors that could affect demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFuture performance at our retail locations will be impacted by general economic conditions including: changes in employment levels; consumer demand, preferences and confidence levels; the availability and cost of credit; fuel prices; levels of discretionary personal income; and interest rates. We are also subject to economic, competitive, and other conditions prevailing in the various markets in which we operate our retail locations, even if those conditions are not prominent nationally.\nRetail powersports sales are cyclical and historically have experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand, which could result in a need to lower the prices at which we sell our powersports offering, which would reduce revenue per vehicle sold and margins. Additionally, a shift in consumer\u2019s vehicle preferences driven by pricing, fuel costs or other factors may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, margins, and results of operations.\nAdverse conditions affecting one or more of the powersports manufacturers with which we hold franchises, or their inability to deliver a desirable mix of vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our new vehicle retail business.\nHistorically, our retail locations have generated most of their revenue through new vehicle sales and related sales of higher-margin products and services, such as finance and insurance products and vehicle-related parts and service. As a result,\nbusiness and results of operations depends on various aspects of vehicle manufacturers\u2019 operations, many of which are outside of its control. Our ability to sell new vehicles is dependent on its manufacturers\u2019 ability to design and produce, and willingness to allocate and deliver to us, a desirable mix of popular new vehicles that consumers demand. Popular vehicles may often be difficult to obtain from manufacturers for a number of reasons, including the fact that manufacturers generally allocate their vehicles based on sales history and associated capital expenditures. Further, if a manufacturer fails to produce desirable vehicles or develops a reputation for producing undesirable vehicles or produces vehicles that do not comply with applicable laws or government regulations, our revenue could be adversely affected as consumers shift their vehicle purchases away from that brand.\nAlthough we seek to limit dependence on any one OEM, there can be no assurance the brand mix allocated and delivered to us will be sufficiently diverse to protect us from a significant decline in the desirability of vehicles manufactured by a particular manufacturer or disruptions in a manufacturer\u2019s ability to produce vehicles. For the year ended December 31, 2021, OEMs representing 10% or more of RumbleOn\u2019s revenue from new powersports vehicle sales were as follows:\nIn addition, the powersports manufacturing supply chain spans the globe. As such, supply chain disruptions may affect the flow of vehicle and parts inventories to an OEM\u2019s manufacturing partners or to us. Until such time as current Demand/Supply Imbalances are resolved, we will continue to experience disruptions in the supply of vehicle and parts inventories. Such continue disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur retail powersports sales may be materially adversely affected by changes in costs or availability of consumer financing.\nA significant portion of our retail powersports sales are financed through RumbleOn Finance and other third-party consumer finance lenders. Reductions in the availability of credit to consumers have contributed to declines in our sales in past periods. Reductions in available consumer credit or increased costs of that credit could result in a decline in sales, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLenders that have historically provided financing to those buyers who, for various reasons, do not have access to traditional financing, including those buyers who have a poor credit history or lack the down payment necessary to purchase a vehicle, are often referred to as subprime lenders. If market conditions cause subprime lenders to tighten credit standards, or if interest rates increase, the ability to obtain financing from subprime lenders for these consumers to purchase vehicles could become limited, resulting in a decline in vehicle sales, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSubstantial competition in powersports sales and services may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe powersports retail and service industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location, and selection. Our competition includes: (i) franchised powersport dealerships in its markets that sell the same or similar new and used vehicles; (ii) privately negotiated sales of used powersport vehicles; (iii) other used powersport vehicle retailers, including regional and national rental companies; (iv) internet-based used powersport vehicle brokers that sell used vehicles to consumers; (v) service center and parts supply chain stores; and (vi) independent service and repair shops.\nWe do not have a material cost advantage over other retailers in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers. We typically rely on our advertising, merchandising, sales expertise, service reputation, strong local branding, and location to sell our products. Because our dealer agreements grant only a non-exclusive right to sell a manufacturer\u2019s product within a specified market area, our revenue, gross profit, and overall profitability may be materially adversely affected if competing dealerships expand their market share. Further, our vehicle manufacturers may decide to award additional franchises in our markets in ways that negatively impact our sales.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with the manufacturers of vehicles we sell and are subject to restrictions imposed by these vehicle manufacturers. Any of these restrictions or any changes or\ndeterioration of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with the manufacturers of the vehicles we sell, which have the ability to exercise a great deal of control and influence over its day-to-day operations, as a result of the terms of its dealer, framework, and related agreements. We may obtain new vehicles from manufacturers, service vehicles, sell new vehicles, and display vehicle manufacturers\u2019 trademarks only to the extent permitted under these agreements. The terms of these agreements may conflict with our interests and objectives and may impose limitations on key aspects of our operations, including our acquisition strategy.\nFor example, manufacturers can set performance standards with respect to sales volume, sales effectiveness, and customer satisfaction, and require us to obtain manufacturer consent before we can acquire dealerships selling a manufacturer\u2019s vehicles. From time to time, we may be precluded under agreements with certain manufacturers from acquiring additional franchises, or subject to other adverse actions, to the extent we are not meeting certain performance criteria at existing stores until performance improves in accordance with the agreements, subject to applicable state franchise laws. In addition, many vehicle manufacturers place limits on the total number of franchises that any group of affiliated dealerships may own and certain manufacturers place limits on the number of franchises or share of total brand vehicle sales that may be maintained by an affiliated dealership group on a national, regional or local basis, as well as limits on store ownership in contiguous markets, which limits may be applicable to the Company as a result of the Transaction. If we reach any of these limits, we may be prevented from making further acquisitions, or we may be required to dispose of certain dealerships, which could adversely affect our future growth. We cannot provide assurance that manufacturers will approve future acquisitions timely, if at all, which could significantly impair the execution of our acquisition strategy.\nManufacturers can also establish new franchises or relocate existing franchises, subject to applicable state franchise laws. The establishment or relocation of franchises in our current markets could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of our retail locations in the market in which the action is taken.\nIf vehicle manufacturers reduce or discontinue sales incentive, warranty, or other promotional programs, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe benefit from sales incentive, warranty, and other promotional programs of vehicle manufacturers that are intended to promote and support their respective new vehicle sales. Key incentive programs include: (i) customer rebates on new vehicles; (ii) dealer incentives on new vehicles; (iii) special financing or leasing terms; (iv) warranties on new and used vehicles; and (v) sponsorship of used vehicle sales by authorized new vehicle dealers.\nVehicle manufacturers often make changes to their incentive programs. Any reduction or discontinuation of manufacturers\u2019 incentive programs for any reason, including a supply and demand imbalance, may reduce our sales volume which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nIf state laws that protect powersports retailers are repealed, weakened, or superseded by our framework agreements with manufacturers, our retail locations may be more susceptible to termination, non-renewal, or renegotiation of their dealer agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nApplicable state laws generally provide that a vehicle manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth \u201cgood cause\u201d and stating the grounds for termination or non-renewal. Some state laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or allow them to attempt to comply with the manufacturer\u2019s criteria within a notice period to avoid the termination or non-renewal. Our agreements with certain manufacturers contain provisions that, among other things, attempt to limit the protections available to dealers under these laws, and, though unsuccessful to date, manufacturers\u2019 ongoing lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of these laws. If these laws are repealed in the states in which we operate, manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice, an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause. Without the protection of these state laws, it may also be more difficult for us to renew dealer agreements upon expiration. Changes in laws that provide manufacturers the ability to terminate our dealer agreements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with current or new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nWe are subject to a wide range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such as those relating to motor vehicle, retail installment sales, leasing, finance and insurance, marketing, licensing, consumer protection, consumer privacy, escheatment, anti-money laundering, environmental, vehicle emissions and fuel economy, and health and safety. The regulatory bodies that regulate our business include, at the federal level: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FTC, the DOT, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Communications Commission; at the state level: various state dealer licensing authorities, state consumer protection agencies including state attorney general offices, and state financial and insurance regulatory agencies; and at the municipal level our business is regulated by various municipal authorities covering licensing, zoning, occupancy, and tax obligations. We are subject to compliance audits of our operations by many of these authorities\nVehicle Sales. Our sale and purchase of vehicles, both new and pre-owned, related products and services and third-party finance products, are subject to the state and local dealer licensing requirements in the jurisdictions in which we have retail or wholesale locations. Regulators of jurisdictions where our customers reside, but in which we do not have a dealer or financing license could require that we obtain a license or otherwise comply with various state regulations. Despite our belief that we are not subject to the licensing requirements of those jurisdictions in which we do not have a physical presence, regulators may seek to impose punitive fines for operating without a license or demand we seek a license in those jurisdictions, any of which may inhibit our ability to do business in those jurisdictions, increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumer Finance. The financing we offer customers is subject to federal and state laws regulating the advertising and provision of consumer finance options, the collection of consumer credit and financial information, along with requirements related to online payments and electronic funds transfers, of whether RumbleOn Finance or a third-party is the entity extending credit to such customers. Most states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees, or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that finance companies file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state.\nLogistics and Transportation. Our Wholesale Express logistics operations, which brokers and facilitates the transportation of vehicles primarily between and among dealers, is subject to motor-carrier rules and regulations promulgated by the DOT and the states through which their customers\u2019 vehicles are transported. Additionally, the vendors whom Wholesale Express relies upon are subject to federal and state regulation concerning transport vehicle dimensions, transport vehicle conditions, driver motor vehicle record history, driver alcohol and drug testing, and driver hours of serves. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, condition, trailer length and configuration, methods of measurement, driver qualifications, or driver hours of service may increase the costs charged to Wholesale Express by its vendors, which may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. If we fail to comply with the DOT regulations or if those regulations become more stringent, we could be subject to increased inspections, audits, or compliance burdens. Regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines, suspending, or shutting down our Wholesale Express operations.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations that pertain to our operations. The regulations concern material storage, air quality, waste handling, and water pollution control. The regulations also regulate our use and operation of gasoline storage tanks, gasoline dispensing equipment, oil tanks, and paint booths among other things. Our business involves the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, including motor oil, gasoline, solvents, lubricants, paints, and other substances. We manage our compliance through permitting and operational control.\nFacilities and Personnel. Our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety, and our employment practices are subject to various laws and regulations, including complex federal, state, and local wage and hour and anti-discrimination laws. We may also be liable for employee misconduct and violations of laws or regulations to which we are subject.\nFederal Advertising Regulations. The FTC has authority to take actions to remedy or prevent advertising practices that it considers to be unfair or deceptive and that affect commerce in the United States. If the FTC takes the position in the future that any aspect of our business constitutes an unfair or deceptive advertising practice, responding to such allegations could require us to pay significant damages, settlements, and civil penalties, or could require us to make adjustments to our products and services, any or all of which could result in substantial adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability.\nFederal Antitrust Laws. The antitrust laws prohibit, among other things, any joint conduct among competitors that would lessen competition in the marketplace. Some of the information that we may obtain from dealers may be sensitive and, if disclosed inappropriately, could potentially be pre-owned by dealers to impede competition or otherwise diminish independent pricing activity. A governmental or private civil action alleging the improper exchange of information, or unlawful participation in price maintenance or other unlawful or anticompetitive activity, even if unfounded, could be costly to defend and adversely impact our ability to maintain and grow our dealer network. In addition, governmental or private civil actions related to the antitrust laws could result in orders suspending or terminating our ability to do business or otherwise altering or limiting certain of our business practices, including the manner in which we handle or disclose pricing information, or the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us in class action or other civil litigation.\nOther. In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business, we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and Nasdaq listing rules. The violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations.\nThe foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to evolving interpretations and continuous change. Violation of the laws or regulations to which we are subject could result in consumer class actions or other lawsuits, government investigations, and administrative, civil, or criminal sanctions against us and, which may include significant fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and future prospects.\nWe are subject to risks associated with imported product restrictions or limitations, foreign trade and currency fluctuations.\nOur business involves the sale of vehicles, parts, or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured outside the United States. As a result, its operations are subject to risks of doing business outside of the United States and importing merchandise, including import duties, exchange rates, trade restrictions, work stoppages, natural or man-made disasters, and general political and socio-economic conditions in other countries. The United States or the countries from which our products are imported may, from time to time, impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or limitations, or adjust presently prevailing quotas, duties, or tariffs. The imposition of new, or adjustments to prevailing, quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Relative weakness of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in the future may result in an increase in costs to us and in the retail price of such vehicles or parts, which could discourage consumers from purchasing such vehicles and adversely impact its revenue and profitability.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class B Common Stock\nOur largest stockholders may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders.\nAt April 5, 2022, two of our stockholders beneficially owned approximately 31.5% of the Company\u2019s voting power. As a result, these individuals may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders. Also, in the future, these stockholders may acquire or dispose of shares of our Class B common stock and thereby increase or decrease their ownership stake in us. Significant fluctuations in the levels of ownership of our largest stockholders could impact the volume of trading, liquidity, and market price of our Class B common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class B common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not currently or for the foreseeable future intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future on the shares of common stock. We intend to reinvest any earning in the development and expansion of our business. As a result, any return on your investment in our common stock will be limited to the appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any.\nWe are currently subject to reduced reporting requirements so long as we are considered a \"smaller reporting company\" and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently subject to reduced reporting requirements so long as we are considered a \"smaller reporting company.\" We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we currently rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAnti-takeover provisions may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could adversely impact our stock price.\nNevada law and our charter, bylaws, and other governing documents contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders, which could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, these provisions could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 16999, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "RMBL"}
