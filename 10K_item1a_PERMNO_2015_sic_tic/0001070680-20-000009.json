{"cik": "1070680", "company": "CENTRAL FEDERAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following are certain risk factors that could impact our business, financial results and results of operations. Investing in our common stock involves risks, including those described below. These risk factors should be considered by prospective and current investors in our common stock when evaluating the disclosures contained in this Form 10-K and in other reports that we file with the SEC. These risk factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, or if additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we believe are immaterial do materialize, then our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risk factors.\nChanges in economic and political conditions could adversely affect our earnings through declines in deposits, loan demand, the ability of our customers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon local and national economic and political conditions, as well as governmental fiscal and monetary policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, money supply and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore, our earnings and our capital. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, fiscal and monetary policy, tariffs, a U.S. withdrawal from or significant renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars, the election of a new U.S. President in 2020, and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect CFBank\u2019s deposit levels and composition, the quality of investment securities available for purchase, demand for loans, the ability of CFBank\u2019s borrowers to repay their loans, and the value of the collateral securing loans made by CFBank. Recent political developments have resulted in substantial changes in economic and political conditions for the U.S. and the remainder of the world. Disruptions in U.S. and global financial markets, and changes in oil production in the Middle East also affect the economy and stock prices in the U.S., which can affect our earnings capital, as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans. The potential effects of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union (Brexit) on the United States are still unknown.\nBecause we have a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows. Moreover, our market activities are concentrated in the following Ohio counties: Franklin County, and contiguous counties through our office in Worthington, Ohio and loan production office in Columbus, Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and contiguous counties through our agency office in Woodmere, Ohio, Hamilton County, and contiguous counties through our office in Glendale, Ohio, Summit County, and contiguous counties through our office in Fairlawn, Ohio; Columbiana County, and contiguous counties through our offices in Wellsville and Calcutta, Ohio. Our success depends on the general economic conditions of these areas, particularly given that a significant portion of our lending relates to real estate located in these regions. Therefore, adverse changes in the economic conditions in these areas could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the amount of our total loans in the past several years. Since January 1, 2015, our total net loans have grown by $406.2 million, or 158.0%, and our total assets have grown by $565.0 million, or 179.0%. Our continued growth may place significant demands on our operations and management, and our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our growth. We may not successfully implement improvements to, or integrate, our management information and control systems, procedures and processes in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In particular, our controls and procedures must be able to accommodate increases in our loan volume and our growth and expansion. If we are unable to manage our loan growth and/or expanded operations, we may experience compliance and operational problems, have to slow the pace of growth, or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth, any one of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses. Higher loan losses could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings.\nWhen we loan money we incur the risk that our borrowers will not repay their loans. We reserve for loan losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of probable incurred credit losses in our loan portfolio. The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial condition and results of operations. It requires subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. It also requires that we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. The allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nlosses in our loan portfolio. We might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have loan losses in excess of the amount reserved. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions. For example, when real estate values decline, the potential severity of loss on a real estate-secured loan can increase significantly, especially in the case of loans with high loan-to-value ratios. A decline in the national economy or in the local economies of the areas in which our loans are concentrated could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures or repossessions resulting in increased charge-off amounts and the need for additional loan loss allowances in future periods. In addition, our determination as to the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by our regulators as part of their examination process, which may result in the establishment of an additional allowance based upon the judgment of the regulators after a review of the information available at the time of their examination. The additions to our allowance for loan losses would be made through increased provisions for loan losses, which would reduce our income and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, earnings and profitability.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Moreover, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has changed its requirements for establishing the allowance for loan losses.\nOn June 16, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13 \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\u201d, which replaces the incurred loss model with an expected loss model, and is referred to as the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. Under the incurred loss model, loans are recognized as impaired when there is no longer an assumption that future cash flows will be collected in full under the originally contracted terms. The FASB voted to defer the effective date for this ASU for smaller reporting companies, such as the Company, to annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2022. Under the CECL model, financial institutions will be required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan. The transition to the CECL model will bring with it significantly greater data requirements and changes to methodologies to accurately account for expected losses under the new parameters. If the methodologies and assumptions that we use in the CECL model are proven to be incorrect, or inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient, resulting in the need for additional allowance for credit losses to be established, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may make, or be required to make, further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio, changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time and other factors specific to a borrower\u2019s circumstances, the level of nonperforming assets will fluctuate. If housing and real estate markets decline, we may experience increased delinquencies and credit losses. An increase in our nonperforming assets, credit losses or our provision for loan losses would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur emphasis on commercial, commercial real estate and multi-family residential real estate lending may expose us to increased lending risks.\nBecause payments on commercial loans are dependent on successful operation of the borrowers\u2019 business enterprises, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are dependent on successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of commercial real estate loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Commercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loans also have larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to single-family residential mortgage loans. Some of our borrowers also have more than one commercial real estate or multi-family residential mortgage loan outstanding with us. Additionally, some loans may be collateralized by junior liens. Consequently, an adverse development involving one or more loans or credit relationships can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development involving a single-family residential mortgage loan.\nOur adjustable-rate loans may expose us to increased lending risks.\nWhile adjustable-rate loans better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate loans, the increased payments required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers upon an interest rate adjustment in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a rising interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate loans help make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are a holding company and depend on our subsidiary bank for dividends.\nThe Holding Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Holding Company\u2019s ability to support its operations, pay dividends on its common shares and service its debt is dependent upon the amount of cash and liquidity available at the Holding Company level, as well as the receipt of dividends and other distributions from CFBank to the extent necessary to fund such dividends. As of December 31, 2019, the Holding Company a total of $10.0 million of cash at the Holding Company level.\nIn the event that CFBank is unable to pay dividends to the Holding Company, the Holding Company may not be able to service its debt, pay its other obligations or pay dividends on its outstanding stock. Accordingly, the Holding Company\u2019s inability to receive dividends from CFBank could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends that CFBank may pay to the Holding Company without regulatory approval. Generally, financial institutions may pay dividends without prior approval as long as the dividend does not exceed the total of the current calendar year-to-date earnings plus any earnings from the previous two years not already paid out in dividends, and as long as the financial institution remains well capitalized after the dividend payment.\nThe ability of CFBank to pay dividends in the future is currently influenced, and could be further influenced, by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines and may restrict the Holding Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends on its common shares. The ability of CFBank and any other subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Holding Company is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements and contractual obligations. There can be no guaranty that CFBank will be able or permitted to pay dividends to the Holding Company in the future, and any such future dividends by CFBank would be based on future earnings and, if necessary, regulatory approval.\nDeposit insurance premiums may increase and have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nThe DIF maintained by the FDIC to resolve bank failures is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions. The costs of resolving bank failures increased for a period of time and decreased the DIF. The FDIC collected a special assessment in 2009 to replenish the DIF and also required a prepayment of an estimated amount of future deposit insurance premiums. If the costs of future bank failures increase, the deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by CFBank may also increase. The FDIC recently adopted rules revising its assessments in a manner benefitting banks, such as CFBank, with assets totaling less than $10 billion. There can be no assurance, however, that assessments will not be changed in the future.\nChanging interest rates may decrease our earnings and asset values.\nManagement is unable to accurately predict future market interest rates, which are affected by many factors, including, but not limited to inflation, recession, changes in employment levels, changes in the money supply and domestic and international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Changes in the interest rate environment may reduce our profits. Net interest income is a significant component of our net income, and consists of the difference, or spread, between interest income generated on interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Although certain interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to which they reprice, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. In addition, residential mortgage loan origination and refinancing volumes are affected by market interest rates on loans. Rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations and refinancings, while falling interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations and refinancings. Our ability to generate gains on sales of mortgage loans is significantly dependent on the level of originations. Cash flows are affected by changes in market interest rates. Generally, in rising interest rate environments, loan prepayment rates are likely to decline, and in falling interest rate environments, loan prepayment rates are likely to increase. A majority of our commercial, commercial real estate and multi-family residential real estate loans are adjustable rate loans and an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of some borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations, especially borrowers with loans that have adjustable rates of interest. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds and other factors may also cause the value of our loans held for sale to change. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, loan volume, asset quality, value of loans held for sale and cash flows, as well as the market value of our securities portfolio and overall profitability.\nAdverse changes in the financial markets may adversely impact our results of operations.\nWhile we generally invest in securities issued by U.S. government agencies and sponsored entities and U.S. state and local governments with limited credit risk, certain investment securities we hold possess higher credit risk since they represent beneficial interests in structured investments collateralized by residential mortgages, debt obligations and other similar asset-backed assets. Even securities issued by governmental agencies and entities may entail risk depending on political and economic changes. Regardless of the level of credit risk, all investment securities are subject to changes in market value due to changing interest rates, implied credit spreads and credit ratings.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLegislative or regulatory changes or actions could adversely impact our business.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, borrowers and the DIF, not to benefit our shareholders.\nRegulations affecting banks and financial services businesses are undergoing continuous change, and management cannot predict the effect of those changes. While such changes are generally intended to lessen the regulatory burden on financial institutions, the impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies could adversely affect our business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on the operation of an institution and the ability to determine the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and policies could result in sanctions being imposed by the regulatory agencies, including the imposition of civil money penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Even the reduction of regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on us if such lessening of restrictions increases competition within our industry or market areas.\nIn light of conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy that occurred in the last decade, regulators increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. In the last several years, Congress and the federal bank regulators have acted on an unprecedented scale in responding to the stresses experienced in the global financial markets. Some of the laws enacted by Congress and regulations promulgated by federal bank regulators subject us and other financial institutions to additional restrictions, oversight and costs that may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition to laws, regulations and supervisory and enforcement actions directed at the operations of banks, proposals to reform the housing finance market contemplate winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could negatively affect our sales of loans.\nWe face strong competition from other financial institutions, financial services companies and other organizations offering services similar to those offered by us, which could result in our not being able to sustain or grow our loan and deposit businesses.\nWe conduct our business operations primarily in Franklin, Cuyahoga, Hamilton, Summit, and Columbiana Counties, Ohio, and make loans generally throughout Ohio, and residential mortgage loans on a national basis. Increased competition within these markets may result in reduced loan originations and deposits. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer the types of loans and banking services that we offer. These competitors include other savings associations, community banks, regional banks and money center banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. Our competitors with greater resources may have a marketplace advantage enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns.\nAdditionally, financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions and banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger clients. These institutions, particularly to the extent they are more diversified than we are, may be able to offer the same loan products and services that we offer at more competitive rates and prices. If we are unable to attract and retain banking clients, we may be unable to sustain current loan and deposit levels or increase our loan and deposit levels, and our business, financial condition and future prospects may be negatively affected.\nProvisions in the Holding Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and statutory provisions could discourage a hostile acquisition of control.\nThe Holding Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains certain provisions that could discourage non-negotiated takeover attempts that certain stockholders might deem to be in their interests or through which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price and that may tend to perpetuate existing management. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation restricts the ability of an acquirer to vote more than 10% of our outstanding common stock. The provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation also include: the classification of the terms of the members of the board of directors; supermajority provisions for the approval of certain business combinations; elimination of cumulative voting by stockholders in the election of directors; certain provisions relating to meetings of stockholders; and provisions allowing the board of directors to consider nonmonetary factors in evaluating a business combination or a tender or exchange offer. The provisions in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation requiring a supermajority vote for the approval of certain business combinations and containing restrictions on acquisitions of the Company\u2019s equity securities provide that the supermajority voting requirements or acquisition restrictions do not apply to business combinations or acquisitions meeting specified board of directors\u2019 approval requirements.\nThe Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation also authorizes the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, as well as 9,090,909 shares of common stock. These shares could be issued without further stockholder approval on terms or in circumstances\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthat could deter a future takeover attempt.\nAdditionally, federal banking laws contain various restrictions on acquisitions of control of national banks and their holding companies.\nThe Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as well as certain provisions of state and federal law, may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a future takeover attempt in which stockholders of the Company otherwise might receive a substantial premium for their shares over then current market prices.\nWe may elect or need to raise additional capital in the future, but capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, federal banking agencies have recently finalized extensive changes to their capital requirements, including the adoption of the Basel III Capital Rules as discussed above, which result in higher capital requirements and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios than those previously in place. The final impact on us is unknown at this time, but could potentially require us to raise additional capital in the future. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and are based on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or on acceptable terms, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely heavily on our management team, and the unexpected loss of key management may adversely affect our operations.\nOur current management team was put in place following the completion of the Company\u2019s common stock offering in August 2012. Our performance since August 2012 has been strongly influenced by our ability to attract and to retain senior management experienced in banking in the markets we serve. Our ability to retain executive officers and the current management team will continue to be important to successful implementation of our strategies. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nChanges in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, financial institutions tax, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, fair values of net deferred tax assets and obligations of states and political subdivisions held in our investment securities portfolio. In addition, our customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by our customers may adversely affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products, which could adversely affect their demand for our loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on our customers could result in defaults on the loans we have made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which we have invested.\nChanges in accounting standards, policies, estimates or procedures could impact our reported financial condition or results of operations.\nThe accounting standard setters, including the FASB, the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The pace of change continues to accelerate and changes in accounting standards can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, actual results may vary materially from management\u2019s estimates. In June 2016, FASB issued a new accounting standard for recognizing current expected credit losses, commonly referred to as CECL. CECL will result in earlier recognition of credit losses and requires consideration of not only past and current events but also reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. The Company will be required to comply with the new standard beginning January 1, 2023. Upon adoption of CECL, credit loss allowances may increase, which would decrease retained earnings and regulatory capital. The federal banking regulators have adopted a regulation that will allow banks to phase in the day-one impact of CECL on regulatory capital over three years. CECL implementation poses operational risk, including the failure to properly transition internal processes or systems, which could lead to call report errors, financial misstatements, or operational losses.\nWe need to constantly update our technology in order to compete and meet customer demands.\nThe financial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nefficiency and may enable us to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to use current technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect our growth, revenue and profit.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client information or breaches in security of our systems could severly harm our business.\nAs part of our financial institution business, we collect, process and store sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both us and third-party service providers. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions poses the risk that technical system flaws, employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems, or attacks by third parties will result in losses and may be difficult to detect. We have security and backup and recovery systems in place, as well as a business continuity plan, to ensure the computer systems will not be inoperable, to the extent possible. The Company also routinely reviews documentation of such controls and backups related to third-party service providers. Our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations. In recent years, some banks have experienced denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank's website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions.\nWe could be adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. We are further exposed to the risk that the third-party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risks as faced by us). These disruptions may interfere with service to our customers, cause additional regulatory scrutiny and result in a financial loss or liability.\nMisconduct by employees could include fraudulent, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of clients or improper use of confidential information. We may not be able to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect this type of activity might not be effective in all cases. Employee errors or misconduct could subject us to civil claims for negligence or regulatory enforcement actions, including fines and restrictions on our business.\nIn addition, there have been instances where financial institutions have been victims of fraudulent activity in which criminals pose as customers to initiate wire and automated clearinghouse transactions out of customer accounts. Although we have policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of our customers, we cannot assure that such policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers. Such activity can result in financial liability and harm to our reputation.\nWe have implemented security controls to prevent unauthorized access to the computer systems and require our third-party service providers to maintain similar controls. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful. A security breach of our computer systems and loss of confidential information, such as customer account numbers and related information, could result in a loss of customers\u2019 confidence and, thus, loss of business. In addition, unauthorized access to or use of sensitive data could subject us to litigation and liability and costs to prevent further such occurrences. Further, we may be impacted by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with us and our customers that involve the theft of customer credit and debit card data, which may include the theft of our debit card personal identification numbers (PINs) and commercial card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in us incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations. To date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks or attempted breaches, or incur resulting losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, and our plans to continue to implement internet and mobile banking capabilities to meet customer demand. As cyber and other data security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nOur assets at risk for cyber-attacks include financial assets and non-public information belonging to customers. We use several third-party vendors who have access to our assets via electronic media. Certain cyber security risks arise due to this access, including cyber espionage, blackmail, ransom, and theft. As cyber and other data security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nAll of the types of cyber incidents discussed above could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customer business, costs of incentives to customers or business partners in order to maintain their relationships, litigation, increased regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions, repairs of system damage, increased investments in cybersecurity (such as obtaining additional\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntechnology, making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel, training personnel and engaging consultants), increased insurance premiums, and loss of investor confidence and a reduction in the price of our common shares, all of which could result in financial loss and material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nNoncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause a material financial loss.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and the USA Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA Patriot Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (also known as FinCEN), a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service.\nThere is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (also known as OFAC). If the Company\u2019s policies, procedures, and systems are deemed deficient, or if the policies, procedures, and systems of the financial institutions that the Company has already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, the Company may be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on Peoples' ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain planned business activities, including acquisition plans, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for the Company.\nWe are at risk of increased losses from fraud.\nCriminals are committing fraud at an increasing rate and are using more sophisticated techniques. In some cases, these individuals are part of larger criminal rings, which allow them to be more effective. Such fraudulent activity has taken many forms, ranging from debit card fraud, check fraud, mechanical devices attached to ATM machines, social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information, or impersonation of clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials. Additionally, an individual or business entity may properly identify itself, yet seek to establish a business relationship for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. An emerging type of fraud even involves the creation of synthetic identification in which fraudsters \"create\" individuals for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. Further, in addition to fraud committed directly against the Company, the Company may suffer losses as a result of fraudulent activity committed against third parties. Increased deployment of technologies, such as chip card technology, defray and reduce certain aspects of fraud; however, criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information, such as unaffiliated healthcare providers and government entities, in order to impersonate the consumer and thereby commit fraud.\nOur business could be adversely affected through third parties who perform significant operational services on our behalf.\nThe third parties performing operational services for the Company are subject to risks similar to those faced by the Company relating to cybersecurity, breakdowns or failures of their own systems, or misconduct of their employees. Like many other community banks, CFBank also relies, in significant part, on a single vendor for the systems which allow CFBank to provide banking services to CFBank\u2019s customers, for which the systems are maintained on CFBank\u2019s behalf by this single vendor.\nOne or more of the third parties utilized by us may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and, if any such event does occur, it may not be adequately addressed, either operationally or financially, by such third party. Certain of these third parties may have limited indemnification obligations to us in the event of a cybersecurity event or operational disruption, or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations.\nFinancial or operational difficulties of a third party provider could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with such third party\u2019s ability to serve the Company. If a critical third-party provider is unable to meet the needs of the Company in a timely manner, or if the services or products provided by such third party are terminated or otherwise delayed and if the Company is not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, our business could be materially adversely effected.\nAdditionally, regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators addressing how banks select, engage and manage their third-party relationships, affects the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships.\nWe depend upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nprovided to us by customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to a business, we may assume that the customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform with GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. We may also rely on the audit report covering those financial statements. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that we rely on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or on financial statements and other financial information that are materially misleading.\nWe may be the subject of litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to our business and reputation.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to claims or legal action from customers, employees or others. Financial institutions like the Company and CFBank are facing a growing number of significant class actions, including those based on the manner of calculation of interest on loans and the assessment of overdraft fees. Future litigation could include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We are also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and other agencies regarding our business. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Like other large financial institutions, we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and/or cause significant reputational harm to our business.\nAlthough publicly traded, our Common Stock has less liquidity than the average liquidity of stocks listed on NASDAQ.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on NASDAQ, our common stock has less liquidity than the average liquidity for companies listed on NASDAQ. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This marketplace depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. This limited market may affect your ability to sell your shares on short notice, and the sale of a large number of shares at one time could temporarily depress the market price of our common stock. For these reasons, our common stock should not be viewed as a short-term investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future, and this volatility may be unrelated to our performance. General market price declines or overall market swings in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nWe may be required to repurchase loans we have sold or indemnify loan purchasers under the terms of the sale agreements, which could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen we sell a mortgage loan, we may agree to repurchase or substitute a mortgage loan if we are later found to have breached any representation or warranty we made about the loan or if the borrower is later found to have committed fraud in connection with the origination of the loan. While we have underwriting policies and procedures designed to avoid breaches of representations and warranties as well as borrower fraud, there can be no assurance that no breach or fraud will ever occur. Required repurchases, substitutions or indemnifications could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nA transition away from LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts could negatively affect our income and expenses and the value of various financial contracts.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which may stop reporting such information after 2021. It is uncertain at this time whether LIBOR will change or cease to exist or the extent to which those entering into financial contracts will transition to any other particular benchmark. Benchmarks that are used in place of LIBOR, such as the Secured Overnight Finance Rate, may perform differently than LIBOR, and such alternative benchmarks may also perform differently in the future than they have in the past. The use of alternative benchmarks may also have other consequences that cannot currently be anticipated. It is also uncertain what will happen with instruments that rely on LIBOR for future interest rate adjustments and which remain outstanding if LIBOR ceases to exist.\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to LIBOR relates to its promissory notes with borrowers, swap contracts with clients, offsetting swap contracts with third parties related to the swap contracts with clients, the Company\u2019s LIBOR-based borrowings and CFBank\u2019s swap contracts which can be tied to LIBOR. The Company\u2019s contracts generally include a LIBOR term (for example, one month, three month, or one year) plus an incremental margin rate. The Company is working through this transition via a multi-disciplinary project team.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting, or reporting, including changes in, or failure to comply with the same, may adversely affect the Company.\nThe banking industry is highly regulated. We are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by various federal and state regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the SEC, the CFPB, the OCC, the FDIC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (also known as FINRA), and various state regulatory agencies. The statutory and regulatory framework that governs the Company is generally designed to protect depositors and customers, the Deposit Insurance Fund, the U.S. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole and not to protect shareholders. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on our business activities (including foreclosure and collection practices), limit the dividends or distributions that we can pay, and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in capital than would otherwise be required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the perceived state of the financial services industry, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Such regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject the Company to restrictions on business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect results of operations, the capital base, and the price of our common shares. Further, any new laws, rules, or regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 86526, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "CFBK"}
