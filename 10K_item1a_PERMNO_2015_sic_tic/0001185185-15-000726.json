Investing in our Common Stock involves risks, including those described below. The risk factors below, among others, should be considered by prospective and current investors in our Common Stock before making or evaluating an investment in our securities. These risk factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected herein.\nOur dependence on government business could adversely affect our operating results\nContracts and purchase orders with agencies of the United States government and various state and local governments represented approximately 22% of our revenues in fiscal year 2014. The success of our business is therefore materially dependent on governmental agencies. Companies engaged in government business, both domestically and internationally, are subject to certain unique risks not shared by the general commercial sector. Among these risks are:\n\u2022\na competitive procurement process with no guaranty of being awarded contracts;\n\u2022\ndependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds;\n\u2022\npolicies and regulations that can be changed at any time by Congress or the Executive branch, or by foreign governments internationally;\n\u2022\nchanges in and delays or cancellations of government programs or requirements; and\n\u2022\nsome contracts with international, Federal, state and local government agencies require annual funding and may be terminated at the agency\u2019s discretion.\nA reduction or shift in spending priorities by government agencies could limit or eliminate the continued funding of our existing government contracts. These reductions or shifts in spending, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur dependence on international sales involves significant risk\nSales and services to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 49%, 48% and 57% of our revenue for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Despite our international sales increasing only slightly by1% as a percentage of total revenue, we continue to expect that our non-U.S. sales and services will continue to grow and account for a higher percentage of overall future revenues. International business operations may be adversely affected by many factors, including fluctuations in exchange rates, imposition of government controls, trade restrictions, political, economic and business events and social and cultural differences.\nIntense competition can adversely affect our operating results\nThe hydro-meteorological monitoring equipment and systems market is intensely competitive. Significant competitive factors include price, technical capabilities, quality, automation, reliability, product availability and customer service. We face competition from established and potential new competitors, many of whom have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. New products offered by our competitors could cause a decline in our revenue or a loss of market acceptance of our existing products and services. Increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price-based competition. Price-based competition may result in lower prices, adversely affecting our operating results.\nThe variability of our quarterly operating results can be significant\nOur future revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. These factors include the relatively large size of project or tender business, unpredictability in the number and timing of international sales, length of the sales cycle, delays in installations and changes in customer\u2019s financial condition or budgets.\nManaging costs while planning for growth will be critical\nWe believe that we must maintain our technical workforce and commit adequate resources to our research and development to develop new products, enhance existing products and serve the needs of our existing and anticipated customer base. Our ability to expand our operations successfully will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Our ability to manage our planned growth effectively also will require that we continue to (1) improve our operational, management, and financial systems and controls, (2) train, motivate, and manage our employees and (3) have the capacity to increase operating expenses in anticipation that our new products will increase future revenues.\nTechnological changes may make our products obsolete or result in decreased prices or increased expenses\nTechnological changes may make our services or products obsolete. Advances in technology may lead to significant price erosion for products. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and offer more advanced products in the future, to anticipate both future demand and the technology to supply that demand, to enhance our current products and services, to provide those products and services at competitive prices on a timely and cost-effective basis and to achieve market acceptance of those products and services. To accomplish these goals, we may be required to incur significant engineering expenses. As new products or services are introduced, we may experience warranty claims or product returns. We may not be able to accomplish these goals correctly or timely enough. If we fail in our efforts, our products and services may become less competitive or obsolete.\nWe do not rely on patents to protect our products or technology\nWe do not generally rely on patent protection for our products or technology. Competitors may develop technologies similar to or more advanced than ours. We treat our products, real-time networks, technology and software as proprietary and rely on trade secret laws and internal non-disclosure safeguards rather than making our designs and processes generally available to the public by applying for patents. We cannot assure that our current or future products will not be copied or will not infringe on the patents of others. Moreover, the cost of litigation of any claim or damages resulting from infringement of patents or other intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur losses due to foreign currency fluctuations\nA portion of our revenue and costs are denominated in other foreign currencies. Consequently, a portion of our revenues, costs and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currencies. We recognized a foreign currency gain of approximately $41,000 in 2014 and foreign currency losses of approximately $97,000 and $12,000 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nAcquisition and integration of new businesses could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management and employees, increase our expenses or adversely affect our business\nA portion of our future growth may be accomplished through the acquisition of other businesses. The success of those acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquired personnel, operations, products, services and technologies into our organization, to retain and motivate key personnel of the acquired entities and to retain the customers of those entities. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, obtain financing on acceptable terms to bring the acquisition to fruition or to integrate such personnel, operations, products or services effectively. The process of identifying and closing acquisition opportunities and integrating acquisitions into our operations may distract our management and employees, disrupt our ongoing business, increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our operations. We may also be subject to certain other risks if we acquire other entities, such as the assumption of additional liabilities. We may issue additional equity securities or incur debt to pay for future acquisitions.\nWe do not have contracts with key suppliers\nWe have no written contracts with any of our suppliers. Our suppliers may terminate their relationships with us at any time without notice. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find satisfactory replacement suppliers or that new suppliers will not be more expensive than the current suppliers if any of our suppliers were to terminate their relationship with us.\nWe are highly dependent on key personnel\nOur success has depended, and to a large extent will depend, on the continued services our key senior executives, and engineering, marketing, sales, production and other personnel. The loss of these key personnel, who would be difficult to replace, could harm our business and operating results. Competition for management in our industry is intense and we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the executive management and other key personnel that we require. We do have an employment agreement with one key employee.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential shareholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting\nWe are required by the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We are likewise required, on an annual basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose on a quarterly basis any material changes in those internal controls.\nAs described in Item 9A - Controls and Procedures elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting with regard to over-recording costs of goods sold and properly identifying estimated costs to complete used in contract revenue calculations. Given these material weaknesses, management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.\nWe have taken actions to remediate and improve our internal controls over financial reporting. We have enhanced checklists and procedures to assure necessary procedures are timely performed, including manual entries such as reversing the costs the Company\u2019s accounting system records for costed repair orders as well as identifying all estimated costs associated with revenue calculations performed on contracts placed on the estimate to complete method of accounting. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations or may lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could result in a material adverse effect on our business or have a negative effect on the trading price of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 73817, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "STRN"}
