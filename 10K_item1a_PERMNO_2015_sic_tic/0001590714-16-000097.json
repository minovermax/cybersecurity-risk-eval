{"cik": "1590714", "company": "Platform Specialty Products Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe ownership of our common stock involves a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report before deciding whether to invest in our securities. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe may not be able to finance and/or consummate any future acquisitions or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business.\nPart of our key strategy is to grow through acquisitions. Failure to consummate any future acquisitions or our failure to integrate successfully or realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from our acquisitions, including the Acquisitions, could result in unanticipated expenses and losses and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate operations and infrastructures and the cost of integration may exceed our initial estimates. In addition, the integration process may result in the disruption of our businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, including the Acquisitions, and could harm our financial performance. Business relationships may also be subject to disruption as customers, suppliers and others may attempt to negotiate changes to the terms of their existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us, including our competitors. Finally, realization of any benefits and cost synergies which we hope to achieve could be affected by the other risk factors described in this Annual Report and a number of factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs, the response of competitors and suppliers and regulatory developments. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to whether or when any benefits or cost synergies we hope to achieve will occur, or the extent to which they actually will be achieved.\nIn addition, we expect to finance any future acquisitions through a combination of available cash on hand, operating cash flow, availability under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as well as with the proceeds from equity or debt offerings. We may not be successful in completing any equity or debt offering, and therefore we may be required to seek a number of alternative financings. If new debt is added to current debt levels, or if we incur other liabilities, including contingent liabilities, in connection with an acquisition, the debt or liabilities could impose additional constraints and requirements on our business and financial performance, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business and fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. As of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was approximately $5.23 billion. Such substantial indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease the amount of our interest expense, because our borrowings include instruments with variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, would result in higher interest expense;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make strategic acquisitions, introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nIn addition, our Credit Facilities and other agreements governing our outstanding debt contain covenants that restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, pay cash dividends, enter new lines of business, repurchase our shares of common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. These restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise take actions that we believe are in the best interest of our business.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend in part upon the future financial and operating performance of our subsidiaries and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make these payments.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness and could be required to seek waivers or amendments to our covenants, alternative sources of financing or reductions in expenditures. We may not be able to obtain such waivers, amendments or alternative financings, or if we obtain them, they may not be on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain waivers or new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, which, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, including:\n\u2022\nsales of assets;\n\u2022\nsales of equity;\n\u2022\nreduction or delay of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances; or\n\u2022\nnegotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt.\nIf we are unable to make payments or refinance our debt, obtain waivers or new financing, or if holders of indebtedness elect to declare all borrowed funds due and/or to terminate their commitments for future funding, those holders could exercise their rights, including assuming control over our deposit accounts and/or commencing foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may need to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets arising from acquisitions become impaired, which would materially adversely affect our net income.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, and the Acquisitions have resulted in significant goodwill and intangible assets being recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets may become impaired in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. We are required under U.S. GAAP to review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if facts and circumstances warrant a review. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization and slower or declining growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets occurs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. There was no impairment of goodwill in 2015, 2014, or during the Successor 2013 period.\nThe failure to attract and retain key personnel, including our executive officers, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business involves complex operations and therefore demands a leadership team and employee workforce that is knowledgeable and expert in many areas necessary for our operations. The failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse material impact on our result of operations. In addition, we are highly dependent on the experience and track records of our management, particularly Martin E. Franklin and Rakesh Sachdev, in successfully acquiring and managing businesses. If one or more of our executive officers were to cease to be employed by us, or if we were unable to replace them in a timely manner, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. At the end of fiscal 2015 and beginning of fiscal 2016, there were several changes made to the members of our senior leadership team, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The effectiveness of the new leaders in these roles, and any further transition as a result of these changes, could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nIn addition, as a company focused on manufacturing and highly technical customer service, we rely on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees, including our specialized research and development and sales and service personnel, in order to maintain our efficient production processes, drive innovation in our product offerings and maintain our deep customer relationships. The departure of a significant number of our highly skilled employees or of one or more employees who hold key management positions could have an adverse impact on our operations, including customers choosing to follow an employee or manager to one of our competitors.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd-Frank, new SEC regulations and NYSE market rules, are creating uncertainty for public companies such as ours. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of managements' time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may also be harmed.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.\nWe are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls.\nAs discussed in this Annual Report in Part II, Item 9A, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and as a result we concluded, based on management's assessment, that our internal control was ineffective as of December 31, 2015. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC and the NYSE, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could affect our stock price.\nEven effective internal controls have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.\nIn addition, our business strategy contemplates the acquisition of businesses and the operation of subsidiaries whose financial results are consolidated into our financial statements and operating reporting. As a result of these combination activities, the scope of our internal control over financial reporting is expected to expand, which will subject us to increased internal control risks, especially as newly acquired businesses are integrated into our processes. Effective internal control over financial reporting must be established and maintained in connection with these acquisitions, if any, in order for us to produce accurate and timely financial reports. Failure to do so could result in our inability to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis, and possibly lead to other deficiencies, which could also likely have a negative impact on our stock price.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not remediated, could affect the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. In connection with this Annual Report, our management has performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, and concluded that our internal control and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2015 as a result of the following material weaknesses relating to:\n\u2022\nthe accounting for acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe completeness, existence and accuracy related to the accounting of income taxes; and\n\u2022\nthe financial close process for the Agricultural Solutions segment to ensure the timely and complete reconciliation of accounts for the CAS business, which is part of the Agricultural Solutions segment.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs discussed in this Annual Report in Part II, Item 9A, we have taken, and continue to take, numerous steps to remediate these material weaknesses and improve our internal controls over financial reporting. However, we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and are continuing to take, will be sufficient to remediate these material weaknesses or avoid potential future material weaknesses. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address these material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future or we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley in a timely manner, our financial statements for one or more periods may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate previously issued financial statements for additional periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our stock price and our ability to access the capital and lending markets.\nWe have restated our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements previously issued in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.\nAs further described in Note 26, Restatement of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited), to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, during the preparation of our annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we discovered an error related to our income tax provision for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The error is the result of recording an unrealized loss associated with foreign currency hedges entered into in connection with the Alent Acquisition as a temporary rather than permanent difference for income tax accounting purposes. As a result, our management concluded, after discussion with Platform's independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, that we were required to restate our unaudited financial information for our third quarter ended September 30, 2015, which our Audit Committee concluded should no longer be relied upon. This Annual Report includes the restatement of our unaudited financial statements for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015 in the aforementioned Note 26. If we are required to restate previously issued financial statements for any additional periods, our reputation could be impaired which could cause a loss of investor confidence and adversely materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur substantial international operations subject us to risks not faced by domestic competitors.\nSales from international markets represent a significant portion of our net sales. Accordingly, our business is subject to increasing risks related to the different legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent to our international operations include the following:\n\u2022\nforeign customers and distributors may have increased credit risk and different financial conditions, which may necessitate longer payment cycles of accounts receivable or result in increased bad debt write-offs (including due to bankruptcy) or additions to reserves;\n\u2022\nforeign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, impose tariffs, duties, export controls, import restrictions or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls may delay, restrict or prohibit the repatriation of funds, and any restrictions on the repatriation of funds may result in adverse tax consequences and tax inefficiencies;\n\u2022\nexport licenses may be difficult to obtain, and the transportation of our products may be delayed or interrupted;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate, including fluctuations in gross domestic product, interest rates, market demand, labor costs and other factors beyond our control, could have an adverse effect on our net sales in those countries; and\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or in foreign regulatory requirements may occur, including in laws or regulatory requirements pertaining to employee benefits, the environment and health and safety.\nFurthermore, some of our international operations are conducted in parts of the world that experience corruption to some degree. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance (including with respect to the FCPA and the Bribery Act as further described below), our employees, distributors and wholesalers could take actions that violate applicable anti-corruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have an adverse impact on our reputation, our results of operations and our financial position.\nWe also may face difficulties managing and administering an internationally dispersed business. In particular, the management of our personnel across many countries can present legal, logistical and managerial challenges. Additionally, international\noperations present challenges related to operating under different business cultures and languages. Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in different legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our operating results and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nOur consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. Dollars while a significant proportion of our assets, liabilities and earnings are denominated in non-U.S. Dollar currencies. As a result, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from translating certain of our foreign subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements. Fluctuations in the value of local currencies in which we derive significant net sales may also impact the U.S. Dollar amounts reflected in our financial statements. Such U.S. Dollar amounts may obscure underlying financial trends that would be apparent in financial statements prepared on a constant currency basis or affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nBesides currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from their functional currency. Our foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign exchange hedges from time to time and on an on-going basis to protect against such transaction exposures. We also periodically enter into deal specific foreign exchange hedges to mitigate our acquisition-related foreign exchange exposure. However, we may not be able to hedge any risk completely or at an acceptable cost, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in any given future reporting periods. Given the volatility of exchange rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction or translation risks or that any volatility in currency exchange rates will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have made investments in, and are expanding our business into, emerging markets and biosolutions, which exposes us to certain risks.\nOur markets continue to shift from more industrialized markets towards emerging markets which require us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries. As a result, we may be subject to a variety of risks including economies that may be dependent on only a few products (and therefore subject to significant fluctuations), consumers with limited or fluctuating discretionary spending on which the end users of our products depend, weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights, exchange controls, unstable governments and privatization, changes in customs or tax regimes, or other government actions affecting the flow of goods and currency. Accordingly, changes in any of those areas may have significant negative impacts on our financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, our investments in biosolutions are risky and may not be profitable. While certain biosolutions products have been in the market for years, biosolutions as a whole is a new and evolving area without a history against which to measure growth and without an established presence in most markets. Biosolutions products work most effectively when used in combination with agrochemicals and have been used as standalone applications in areas of low pest pressure. The demand for biosolutions products is increasingly driven by the desire to increase agricultural yield and quality, coupled with heightened public concern relating to residue on crops for human consumption and feed for animals as well as public demand for new and innovative ways to address crop risks. As with any growing, evolving industry, there is a risk that adoption will not be as robust as we expect. In such circumstances, we may not achieve the anticipated level of returns on our investment in biosolutions, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of independent distributors, contract manufacturers or key customers or suppliers could adversely affect our overall sales and profitability.\nIn our Performance Solutions segment, we have key customers, the loss of which may impair our results of operations for the affected earnings periods. The principal products purchased by such customers are surface finishing chemicals and solid sheet printing elements. In addition, we use a variety of specialty and commodity chemicals in our manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis. We typically purchase our major raw materials on a contract or as needed basis from outside sources. The availability and prices of raw materials may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, the financial stability of our suppliers, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, new laws or regulations, changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels (especially for raw materials derived from petrochemical based feedstocks). In some cases, we are limited in our ability to purchase certain raw materials from other suppliers by our supply agreements which contain certain minimum purchase requirements. Additionally, as our supply contracts expire, we may not be able to renew such contracts on terms favorable to us. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of raw materials increase significantly.\nIn our Agricultural Solutions segment, we rely on unaffiliated contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain products or key components of products. There is limited available manufacturing capacity that meets our quality standards and regulatory requirements. If we are unable to arrange for sufficient production capacity among our contract manufacturers or if our contract manufacturers encounter production, quality, financial, or other difficulties (including labor or geopolitical disturbances), we may encounter difficulty in meeting customer demands as the manufacture of our products may not be easily transferable to other sites. In addition, many of our products are developed or distributed through strategic partnerships. Some of our existing formulated products and others currently under development include combinations of proprietary AIs or combinations of AIs with proprietary safeners or adjuvants. Some of these proprietary AIs, safeners, and adjuvants are owned by third parties, and the development and commercialization of such products are carried out through contractual strategic arrangements with such third parties. We may also be dependent on a limited number of key suppliers for AIs. In addition, we generally do not have long-term supply contracts with AI suppliers for our regional portfolio. If our sources of AI supplies are terminated or affected by adverse prices or other concerns, we may not be able to identify alternate sources of AI supplies to sustain our sales volumes on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe also rely on independent distributors within each segment to distribute our products and to assist us with the marketing and sale of certain of our products. There can be no assurance that our distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products to end users, or will be successful in selling our products, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights and the rights to our proprietary processes, methods, compounds and other technology. Failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies. We rely on commonly used legal and business protections, but we may be unable to prevent third-parties from using our intellectual property and other proprietary information without our authorization, particularly in countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights to the same degree as in the United States. In addition, a vigorous prosecution of an infringement claim is not always cost effective or practical.\nIn some cases, we rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, our confidentiality agreements could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise.\nIn addition, we rely on both registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our name and brands. Failure to adequately maintain the quality of our products and services associated with our trademarks or any loss to the distinctiveness of our trademarks may cause us to lose certain trademark protection. Further, competitors may infringe our trademarks, potentially resulting in litigation.\nFinally, the failure to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary information (including unsuccessful enforcement proceedings) could have a material adverse effect on our competitive advantages and/or our business, results of operations and share price.\nWe may experience claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products.\nWe seek to improve our business processes and develop new products and applications. Many of our competitors have a substantial amount of intellectual property that we must continually monitor to avoid infringement. We may experience claims that our processes and products infringe issued patents (whether present or future) or other intellectual property rights belonging to others. From time to time, we oppose patent applications that we consider overbroad or otherwise invalid in order to maintain the ability to operate freely in our various business lines without the risk of being sued for patent infringement. If, however, patents are subsequently issued on any such applications by other parties, or if patents belonging to others already exist that cover our products, processes or technologies, we could experience claims of infringement or have to take other remedial or curative actions to continue our production and sales activities with respect to one or more products. Further, intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and could divert our management\u2019s attention from operating our business.\nIn addition, many of our products directly or indirectly are offered as presenting critical performance attributes, which expose us to a greater risk of product liability claims. If a person were to bring a product liability suit against one of our customers, that customer may in turn attempt to seek damage compensation from us. A person may also bring a product liability claim directly against us. A successful product liability claim or series of claims against us in excess of our insurance coverage for payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. While we endeavor to protect ourselves\nfrom such claims and exposures in our contractual negotiations (including through indemnification provisions), we cannot assure you that our efforts in this regard will ultimately protect us from any such claims.\nWe depend upon our information technology systems, which if they do not perform adequately may disrupt our business operations.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately. The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur net sales and gross profit have varied depending on our product, customer and geographic mix for any given period, which makes it difficult to forecast future operating results.\nOur net sales and gross profit vary among our products, customers and markets, and therefore may be different in future periods from historic or current periods. Overall gross profit margins in any given period are dependent in large part on the product, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period\u2019s net sales. Market trends, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory conditions, severe weather and other factors may also result in reductions in revenue or pressure on the gross profit margins of certain segments in a given period.\nThe varying nature of our product, customer and geographic mix between periods, including the historically seasonable nature of our agrochemical operations, has materially impacted our net sales and gross profit between periods during certain recessionary times and may lead to difficulties in measuring the potential impact of market, regulatory and other factors on our business. As a result, we may be challenged in our ability to forecast our future operating results.\nFurther, potential future business acquisitions can compound the difficulty in making comparisons between prior, current and future periods because acquisitions, which are not ordinary course events, also affect our gross profit margins and our overall operating results.\nAdverse weather conditions, as well as seasonality, may cause fluctuations in the revenue and operating results of our Agricultural Solutions business.\nSales volumes for agrochemical products, like all agricultural products, are subject to the sector\u2019s dependency on weather and disease and pest infestation conditions. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as storms, hurricanes, tsunamis, hail, tornadoes, freezing conditions, extreme heat, drought and floods in a particular region could have a material adverse effect on our Agricultural Solutions business. The agricultural industry, including our Agricultural Solutions business, may also be adversely affected by global climate change and its impact on weather conditions such as changes in precipitation patterns and the increased frequency of extreme weather events.\nIn addition, our agrochemical operations are seasonal, with a greater portion of total net revenue and operating income occurring in the second and fourth quarters. As a result of seasonality, any factors that would negatively affect our second and fourth quarter results in any year, including severe weather conditions and natural disasters that affect decisions by our customers and end-users about the types and amounts of agrochemicals and biosolutions products to purchase and the timing of use of such products, could have an adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and results of operations of our Agricultural Solutions business for the entire year.\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect our net sales, gross profit and financial condition and result in delays or reductions in our spending, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur products are sold in industries that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including agricultural, animal health, electronics, graphic arts, plating, and offshore oil and gas production and drilling industries. Accordingly, our net sales, gross profit and financial condition depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for our products and services in the markets in which we compete. In particular, weak economic conditions in parts of China and South America may have an adverse effect on our results. A delay or a reduction in customer spending due to an economic downturn would reduce\ndemand for our products and services and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndustry trends and characteristics may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe believe that the specialty chemical industry in general, and the printing industry in particular, are cyclical and subject to constant and rapid technological change, product obsolescence, price erosion, evolving standards, short product lifecycles, raw material price fluctuations and changes in product supply and demand. The specialty chemical industry is currently being affected by globalization and a shift in customers\u2019 businesses while the printing industry is currently shrinking. The trends and characteristics in these industries may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur specialty chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers. Changes, including technological changes, in our customers\u2019 products or processes may make our specialty chemicals unnecessary, which would reduce the demand for those chemicals. We have had, and may continue to have, customers that find alternative materials or processes and therefore no longer require our products, which had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition, and our failure to compete successfully may have an adverse effect on our net sales, gross profit and financial condition.\nWe operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product introductions and improvements. We also encounter competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, greater brand recognition, and a larger base of customers than us in one or more of the markets in which we sell our products. As a result, such competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the research and development, manufacturing, formulation, promotion, or sale of their products, receive greater resources and support from independent distributors, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, or more readily take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities. Further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment, such as the merger of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and The Dow Chemical Company, could result in larger competitors that compete with us on several levels.\nWe compete primarily on the basis of quality, technology, performance, reliability, brand, reputation, range of products, and service and support. The competitive landscape for biosolutions is less well-established than for agrochemicals because it is a newer and less mature area that remains in development. We compete with biosolutions providers that have similar product claims and offer potential functional substitutes for our products. Customer education and corresponding demand creation is a critical element of competing within the biosolutions sector. We expect our competitors to continue to develop and introduce new products and to enhance their existing products, which may cause a decline in market acceptance of our products. Our competitors may also improve their manufacturing processes or expand their manufacturing capacity, which could make it more difficult or expensive for us to compete successfully. In addition, our competitors could enter into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers, which could limit our ability, or significantly increase costs, to acquire necessary raw materials or to generate sales. At the same time, an increasing number of our products are coming off patent and are thus available to generic manufacturers to produce. As a result, we anticipate that we will continue to face new and different competitive challenges.\nIn addition, our operating results are influenced in part by our ability to introduce new products and services that offer distinct value to our customers. We seek to provide tailored products for our customers\u2019 often unique problems, which require an ongoing level of innovation. Even where we devote significant human and financial resources to develop new technologically advanced products and services, we may not be successful in these efforts. If we are not able to continue technological innovation and successful commercial introduction of new products, our customers may turn to other producers to meet their requirements, which may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChemical manufacturing is inherently hazardous and may result in accidents, which may disrupt our operations or expose us to significant losses or liabilities.\nThe hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes are inherent in our operations.\nOur research and development, manufacturing, formulating and packaging activities involve the use of hazardous materials and the generation of hazardous waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination, discharge or injury resulting from those materials. Also, our suppliers or contract manufacturers may use and/or generate hazardous materials in connection with producing our products. We may be required to indemnify our suppliers, contract manufacturers or waste disposal contractors against damages and other liabilities arising out of the production, handling or storage of our products or raw materials or the disposal of related wastes. Potential risks include explosions and fires, chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, and pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures. Those hazards may result in personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, which may result in a suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions, cleanup costs, and claims by governmental entities or third-parties. We are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities (including third-party manufacturing on a tolling basis), and the loss or shutdown of operations over an extended period could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations currently use, and have historically used, hazardous materials and generate, and have historically generated, quantities of hazardous waste. Alent, for example, is subject to regulatory oversight and investigation, remediation, and monitoring obligations at its current and former Superfund sites, as well as third-party disposal sites, under federal laws and their state and local analogues, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as analogous foreign laws. In particular, Alent is subject to ongoing obligations at active sites in the U.S. and is conducting closure activities pursuant to the RCRA at several sites in the U.S. The costs and liabilities associated with these issues may be substantial and may materially impact the financial health of our company.\nWe may incur material costs relating to environmental and health and safety requirements or liabilities, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the environment and the generation, use, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Our operations bear the risk of violations of those laws and sanctions for violations such as clean-up and removal costs, long-term monitoring and maintenance costs, costs of waste disposal, fines for natural resource damage, and payments for property damage and personal injury. Additionally, those requirements, and enforcement of those requirements, may become more stringent in the future. The ultimate cost of compliance with any such requirements could be material. We have incurred, are incurring and will in the future incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Although it is our policy to comply with such laws and regulations, it is possible that we have not been or may not be at all times in compliance with all of those requirements.\nAt any given time, we may be involved in claims, litigation, administrative proceedings, settlements and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions involving potential environmental liabilities. In particular, we are currently involved in various investigations due to historic operations. Liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be joint and several and imposed retroactively, regardless of fault or the legality of the activities that gave rise to the contamination. Some of our formulating and manufacturing facilities have an extended history of chemical formulating and manufacturing operations or other industrial activities, and contaminants have been detected at some of our sites and offsite disposal locations. Ultimate environmental costs are difficult to predict and may vary from current estimates and reserves. The discovery of additional contaminants, the inability or failure of other liable parties to satisfy their obligations, the imposition of additional cleanup obligations, or the commencement of related third-party claims could result in significant additional costs.\nOur offshore oil industry products are subject to the hazards inherent in the offshore oil production and drilling industry, and we may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards.\nWe produce water-based hydraulic control fluids for major oil companies and drilling contractors to be used for potentially hazardous offshore deep water production and drilling applications. Offshore deep water oil production and drilling are subject to hazards that include blowouts, explosions, fires, collisions, capsizing, sinking and damage or loss to pipeline, subsea or other facilities from severe weather conditions. Those hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. A catastrophic occurrence at a location where our products are used may expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, product liability or commercial claims. To the extent available, we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is customary in our industry. Such insurance does not, however, provide coverage for all liabilities, and we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant offshore deep water oil production or drilling event that results in liability to us that is not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our products may be subject to various export control regulations and exports may require a license from the U.S. Department of State or the U.S. Department of Commerce.\nCompanies must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services, and technology. In the United States, these laws include, among others, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), administered by the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Some of our products or technology may have military or strategic applications governed by the ITAR or represent so-called \u201cdual use\u201d items governed by the EAR. As a result, these products may require government licenses to be exported to certain jurisdictions or persons. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nHistorically, we have contested significant tax assessments and we are likely to contest additional tax assessments in the future.\nWe have a large and complex international tax profile. From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have received tax assessments for significant amounts from the tax authorities of the countries in which they operate, especially in Brazil. We are currently contesting tax assessments in several administrative and legal proceedings, and our challenges are at various stages. If determined adversely, these proceedings may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, in some jurisdictions, challenges to tax assessments require the posting of a bond or security for the contested amount, which may reduce our flexibility in operating our agrochemicals business.\nIn addition, we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, income taxes payable, and net deferred tax position. There are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in our historical financial statements. An audit or litigation can result in significant additional income taxes payable in the jurisdictions in which we operate which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the FCPA and other similar anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and damage our reputation.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit companies, directors, officers, employees, and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an improper advantage. Under many of these laws, companies may also be held liable for actions taken by third-parties acting on their behalf, such as strategic or local partners or representatives. Certain anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, also prohibit commercial bribery and the receipt of bribes, while others, such as the FCPA, require companies to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. Certain of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business are perceived to have a heightened risk for corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other improper practices. We also count governments among our customers, which increases our risks under the FCPA, the Bribery Act and other laws. Our businesses prohibit bribery and unethical conduct, but these policies may not prevent our employees or agents from violating these laws. Failure by us or our intermediaries to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, governmental authorities in the United States or elsewhere, as applicable, may result in civil and/or criminal penalties against us, our officers or our employees, prohibition on the conduct of our business, which could all damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are subject to numerous, complex government regulations dealing with the production and sale of chemicals and compliance with these regulations could require us to incur additional costs or to reformulate or discontinue certain of our products.\nWe, our business, our products and our customers\u2019 products are subject to regulation by many U.S. and non-U.S. supranational, national, federal, state and local governmental authorities. Regulations include customs, imports and international trade laws, export control, antitrust laws, environmental, global climate change, health and safety requirements and zoning and occupancy laws that regulate manufacturers generally or govern the importation, promotion and sale of our products, the operation of factories and warehouse facilities and our relationship with our customers, suppliers and competitors. Our products and manufacturing processes are also subject to ongoing reviews by certain governmental authorities.\nNumerous laws regulating the production and marketing of chemical substances govern us. Dozens of substances manufactured, imported, and used by us are regulated under the European Union REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals) regulation and similar laws in other jurisdictions. We will need to submit a registration for many of these substances between now and June 1, 2018, and the costs associated with these registrations could be substantial. Moreover, if a registration\napplication was, or in the future is, not submitted by any applicable deadline, our ability to sell those products may be negatively impacted until the registration process has been completed. In addition, we manufacture, process and/or use substances regulated under the REACH regulation\u2019s Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) program. Impacts of regulation under this program could include requirements to discontinue certain product lines and to reformulate others, which could materially alter our marketplace position or otherwise have a material financial effect on our revenues. We also have several product lines that currently rely on lead-based solder and many others that historically did so. Legal claims have been brought alleging harmful exposures or contamination as a result of lead-based solder, and it is possible that we may face additional claims in the future. Some of the laws and regulations applicable to us have changed in recent years to impose new obligations that could also force us to reformulate or discontinue certain of our products. As one example, European Union laws are now requiring a regulatory assessment of plant protection products which contain an active ingredient listed as a \u201ccandidate for substitution\u201d; based on this assessment, the European Commission or an individual member state may decide not to authorize the product for continued sale. To comply with these laws, we may need to alter our product lines, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur agrochemical and biosolutions products are subject to technical review and approval by government authorities in each country where we wish to sell our products. The regulatory requirements are complex and vary from country to country. They are also subject to frequent changes as new data requirements arise in response to scientific developments. Although the approval process, referred to as \u201cregistration,\u201d varies from country to country, all processes generally mandate periodic product reviews, referred to as \u201cre-registration,\u201d which can often result in the requirement to generate new data and could result in either restrictions being placed on the permissible uses of the product going forward or in a refusal by the relevant government authority to grant a re-registration for the product altogether. Notably, scientific developments often result in new data requirements under these regulatory directives, laws and/or regulations, thereby impacting both the scope and timing of the process as well as the likelihood of a registration or re-registration being granted by the relevant government authority. Globally, a large number of AIs in our agrochemical products are currently or will soon be subject to such re-registration processes which may result in products having their approval for sale withdrawn in some countries. We cannot assure you that registrations will be granted to us on a timely basis, or at all. Any delay in obtaining, or any failure to obtain or maintain those registrations, would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from those products.\nCompliance with government regulations regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may result in increased costs and risks.\nAs part of Dodd-Frank, the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals. The EU and other foreign jurisdictions may in the future also enact rules regarding conflict minerals, which could potentially cover additional minerals and locations where minerals originate. We are currently in the process of evaluating the use of conflict minerals in the products formulated by the legacy Arysta, Alent and the OMG Businesses, and could incur significant costs related to implementing a process that will meet the mandates of Dodd-Frank. Our material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and due to the complexity of our supply chain we may not be able to easily verify the origins of conflict minerals used in the products we sell. Any non-compliance with the applicable standards or regulations may result in reputational challenges and affect our financial condition, operations or future operating results.\nWe may be unable to ensure compliance with international trade restrictions and economic sanctions laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have operations, assets and/or make sales in countries all over the world, including countries that are or may become the target of the United States and other countries\u2019 trade restrictions, including economic sanctions, which we refer to collectively as \u201cEconomic Sanctions Laws.\u201d Economic Sanctions Laws are complex and change with time as international relationships and confrontations between and among nations evolve. For example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. State Department administer certain laws and regulations that impose penalties upon U.S. persons and entities and, in some instances, non-U.S. entities, for conducting activities or transacting business with certain countries, governments, entities, or individuals subject to U.S. Economic Sanctions Laws. Given the breadth of our international operations and the scope of our sales globally, including via third party distributors over whom we may have limited or no control, coupled with the complexity and ever-changing nature of Economic Sanctions Laws, there can be no assurance that we have been in the past or will at all times in the future be in full compliance. If we fail to comply with Economic Sanctions Laws, investigations and/or actions could be taken against us that could materially and adversely affect our reputation or have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe have numerous equity instruments outstanding that could require us to issue additional shares of common stock. Therefore, you may experience significant dilution of your ownership interests and the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or the anticipation of such issuances, could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe have numerous equity instruments outstanding that could require us to issue additional shares of our common stock. Depending on the equity instrument, these additional shares may either be issued for no additional consideration or based on a fixed amount of additional consideration. Specifically, as of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding the following:\n\u2022\n2,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock which are convertible into shares of our common stock, on a one-for-one basis, at any time at the option of the holder;\n\u2022\n600,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, issued in connection with the Arysta Acquisition, which are convertible into 22,107,590 shares of our common stock at any time at the option of the Arysta Seller. Each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock that has not previously been converted into shares of common stock will be automatically redeemed in connection with certain mergers or consolidations, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Platform and its subsidiaries, the sale of certain subsidiaries of Platform or a dissolution, liquidation or termination of Platform. On April 20, 2017, we will be required to repurchase each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock that has not been converted into shares of common stock of Platform, or automatically redeemed as described above;\n\u2022\n8,061,609 exchange rights which require us to issue shares of our common stock in exchange for shares of common stock of PDH, on a one-for-one basis, at any time at the option of the holder;\n\u2022\n175,000 options which are exercisable to purchase shares of our common stock, on a one-for-one basis, at any time at the option of the holder; and\n\u2022\n831,436 RSUs which were granted to employees under our 2013 Plan. Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one (1) share of our common stock.\nWe have approximately 14,302,772 shares of our common stock currently available under the 2013 Plan, net of the RSUs noted above (subject to increase in accordance with the terms of such plan) and an additional 5,123,315 shares of our common stock currently available under the ESPP.\nIn addition, the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive an annual dividend on their Series A Preferred Stock in the form of shares of our common stock. For 2015, no stock dividend was declared with respect to their Series A Preferred Stock. Since December 31, 2014, the dividend amount is calculated based on the appreciated stock price compared to the highest dividend price (calculated based upon the average of the last ten trading days of the year\u2019s volume weighted average share prices) previously used in calculating the Series A Preferred Stock dividends. In 2014, the dividend price was $22.85. Such issuance of common stock as stock dividend in the future could have a dilutive impact on, and reduce the value of, our outstanding common stock.\nWe may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur Board is authorized to create and issue one or more additional series of preferred stock, and, with respect to each series, to determine the number of shares constituting the series and the designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, which may include dividend rights, conversion or exchange rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms and liquidation preferences, without stockholder approval. If we create and issue one or more additional series of preferred stock, it could affect your rights or reduce the value of our outstanding common stock. Our Board could, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and which could have certain anti-takeover effects.\nWe cannot assure you that we will declare dividends or have the available cash to make dividend payments.\nTo the extent we intend to pay dividends on our common stock, we will pay such dividends at such times (if any) and in such amounts (if any) as our Board determines appropriate and in accordance with applicable law. We are also subject to certain restrictions in our financing arrangements which may prohibit or limit our ability to pay dividends. Additionally, for so long as any shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividend or distribution may be declared or paid or set aside for payment on all or substantially all the outstanding shares of any other series of preferred stock, other than the Series A Preferred Stock, or common stock without the prior vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of\nSeries B Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting separately as a single class. We therefore can give no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends going forward or as to the amount of such dividends, if any.\nWe operate as a holding company and our principal source of operating cash is income received from our subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company and do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests of our subsidiaries. Our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our obligations or to pay dividends is highly dependent on the earnings of, and receipt of funds from, our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans. As a result, we are dependent on the income generated by our subsidiaries to meet our expenses and operating cash requirements. The amount of distributions and dividends, if any, which may be paid to us from each of our subsidiaries will depend on many factors, including the results of operations and financial condition, limits on dividends under applicable law, such subsidiary's constitutional documents, documents governing any indebtedness of such subsidiary, and other factors which may be outside our control. If our subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may be unable to pay our expenses or make distributions and dividends on our shares of common stock.\nWe are governed by Delaware law, which has anti-takeover implications.\nWe are governed by Delaware law. The application of Delaware law to us may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts or a change in control. In particular, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. A Delaware corporation may opt out of that provision either with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or in an amendment to its certificate of incorporation or by-laws approved by its stockholders. We have not opted out of this provision. Section 203 could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us.\nVolatility of our stock price could adversely affect our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u2022\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of management, securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u2022\nthe failure to remediate identified material weaknesses;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our Company or our industry in general;\n\u2022\noperating and securities price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nnews reports and publication of research reports relating to our business or trends in our markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our businesses;\n\u2022\nannouncements or strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;\n\u2022\nthe failure to identify and complete acquisitions in the future or unexpected difficulties or developments related to the integration of recently completed, pending or future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as recessions and acts of war or terrorism; and\n\u2022\nthe risk factors set forth in this Annual Report and other matters discussed herein.\nFluctuations in the price of our common stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of a stockholder\u2019s investment in our Company. Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of the financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of us and our subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of our common stock may depress the price of our common stock.\nIf we or any of our stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, or if we issue a large number of shares of common stock in connection with future acquisitions, financings or other circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Moreover, the perception in the public market that we or our stockholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of those shares.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our shares of common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances or sales of our shares will have on the market price of such shares. Sales of substantial amounts of our shares, including sales by significant stockholders, and shares issued in connection with any pending or future acquisition, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock. Possible sales also may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price we deem necessary or appropriate.", "PERMNO": 14406, "SIC": 2890, "TIC": "ESI"}
