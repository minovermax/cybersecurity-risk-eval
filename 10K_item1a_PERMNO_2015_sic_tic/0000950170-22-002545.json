{"cik": "1588972", "company": "Recro Pharma, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see page 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. All references and risks related to the launch, commercialization or sale of any of our product candidates are predicated on such product candidates receiving the requisite marketing and regulatory approval in the United States and applicable foreign jurisdictions.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe acquisition and integration of IriSys may present many risks and we may not realize the strategic and financial goals that were contemplated at the time we completed the acquisition.\nWe acquired IriSys on August 13, 2021, and we are in the process of integrating IriSys with our Company. The success of the acquisition depends on, among other things, our ability to combine our business with IriSys in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing relationships and allows us to achieve operational synergies. If we are unable to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In particular, the acquisition may not be accretive to our stock value in the near or long term.\nSome of the risks we may face in connection with the acquisition include the following:\n\u2022We may not realize the benefits we expected to receive from the transaction, such as anticipated synergies;\n\u2022We may have difficulties managing IriSys\u2019 business portfolio or retaining key personnel from IriSys;\n\u2022We may experience performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business caused by integration efforts;\n\u2022The acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not successfully integrate IriSys as planned, there could be unanticipated adverse impacts on IriSys\u2019 business, or we may otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we record as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill;\n\u2022Our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by (i) claims or liabilities related to IriSys\u2019 business including, among others, claims from U.S. or international regulatory or other governmental agencies, terminated employees, current or former customers or business partners, or other third parties; (ii) pre-existing contractual relationships of IriSys that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification\nof which may be costly or disruptive to our business; (iii) unfavorable accounting treatment as a result of IriSys\u2019 practices; (iv) future intellectual property claims or disputes; and (v) the final valuation and accounting treatment of the acquisition and any reclassification or estimates needed to conform presentation between IriSys and Recro;\n\u2022Prior to the acquisition, IriSys was not required to maintain an internal control infrastructure that would meet the standards of a public company in the United States, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The costs that we may incur to implement such controls and procedures may be substantial and we could encounter unexpected delays and challenges in this implementation. In addition, we may discover significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of IriSys\u2019 financial and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u2022IriSys operates in segments of the contract development and manufacturing organization market that we have less experience with, and our further expansion of operations into these areas could present various integration challenges and result in increased costs and other unforeseen challenges; and\n\u2022We may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances that occurred prior to our acquisition of IriSys, which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, and other adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could be adversely affected or could reduce our future earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results and, as a result, adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs integrating the operations of IriSys, as well as higher regulatory and personnel costs, which cannot be fully estimated accurately at this time. If the total costs of the integration of our companies exceed the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur revenues are dependent on a small number of commercial partners, and the loss of any one of these partners, or a decline in their orders, may adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on a small number of commercial partners, with our three largest customers (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., or Teva, Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, and Lannett Company, Inc., or Lannett) having generated 82% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which Teva generated 35%, Novartis generated 24% and Lannett generated 23%. If any one or more of these commercial partners faces increasing or new competition in their market, adjusts pricing, significantly reduces their purchasing volume or experiences financial difficulties such as bankruptcy, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nOur profit sharing, royalty, and manufacturing revenues also depend on the ability of our commercial partners to effectively market and sell their products to their customers. A commercial partner may choose to devote its efforts to its other products or reduce or fail to devote the necessary resources to provide effective sales and marketing support for the products we manufacture and supply. Furthermore, the acquisition of or change in strategy by one of our customers could impact projects we are currently working on or planning to work on in the future. Our commercial partners face competition from other pharmaceutical companies for sales of products to end users. Competition from sellers of generic drugs is a major challenge for our commercial partners, and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights for the products we manufacture can have a significant adverse effect on their sales volume and price. In addition, as pharmaceutical product pricing faces scrutiny by governments, legislative bodies and enforcement agencies, our commercial partners may lower their prices or adopt cost-savings measures which could be passed on to us or otherwise impact our profit-sharing revenues. Further, any commercial partner may divest the product we manufacture for them in whole or in certain markets, which may involve termination of our contract with such partner or the assignment of such contract to a new partner who may not be as effective at selling or commercializing such product. These pricing changes and any significant reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from our commercial partners could adversely affect our revenues.\nOur failure to obtain new customer contracts or renew existing contracts may adversely affect our business.\nOur agreements with Teva and Lannett expire on December 31, 2024, and our agreement with Novartis expires on December 31, 2023. If any of these commercial partners fail to renew their contract, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. We continually seek to renew existing customer contracts and secure new contracts, which subjects us to potentially significant pricing pressures. While our preferred practice is to renegotiate new or extended agreements prior to expiration, in the event we are unable to replace existing contracts in a timely manner or at all, or are forced to accept terms, including pricing terms, less favorable to us, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our business operations and financial results.\nOur sales and manufacturing operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 were disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic due to production slowdowns, stoppages and decreased demand for the products we manufacture. While we do not currently expect that future results will be materially impacted by the pandemic, there can be no assurance that such future results will not be impacted. While vaccines have proven effective in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19, including the variants that have evolved to date, the overall vaccination rate in the United States has not reached the level required for herd immunity. Certain variants of COVID-19, such as the delta and omicron variants, are proving to be more easily spread than earlier variants. We may also be adversely impacted by broader economic effects associated with the pandemic such as inflation, changes in laws and general volatility in the markets.\nFailure to obtain manufacturing components, supplies and related materials from third-party manufacturers, including due to supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and inflationary pressures on materials and labor, could affect our ability to manufacture and deliver our products and sustain our profitability.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to supply many of our manufacturing components, supplies and related materials, which in some instances are supplied from a single source. We also rely on our labor force to sustain our operations. Prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key manufacturing components, supplies and related materials, including due to the sweeping effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had on commercial activity throughout the world; difficulty implementing replacement materials or new sources of supply; or a significant increase in the prices of manufacturing components, supplies and related materials or labor could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or cash flows. In particular, manufacturing problems may occur with these suppliers, and if a supplier provides us with manufacturing components, supplies and related materials that are deficient or defective or if a supplier fails to provide us with such materials or supplies in a timely manner, we may have limited ability to find appropriate substitutes or otherwise meet required specifications and deadlines. Moreover, we could experience inventory shortages if we are required to use an alternative supplier on short notice, which also could lead to manufacturing components, supplies and related materials being purchased on less favorable terms than we have with our regular suppliers. If such problems occur, we may not be able to manufacture our products profitably or on time, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSeveral of our manufacturers and suppliers conduct business internationally. Travel bans and other restrictions may affect the ability of these companies to conduct commercial activity, which could disrupt our supply chain and negatively impact our operations. If our suppliers are unable to provide the products and manufacturing components necessary to conduct our business, we may experience inventory shortages, and could be required to use an alternative supplier on short notice and enter into agreements on less favorable terms than we have with our regular suppliers. We also rely on third parties for the maintenance of our facilities and equipment. The continuing COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk that any of the third parties on which we rely may be prevented from conducting normal business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities.\nOur and our customers\u2019 failure to receive or maintain regulatory approval for product candidates or products could negatively impact our revenue and profitability.\nOur business materially depends upon the regulatory approval of the products we manufacture. As such, if we or our customers experience a delay in, or failure to receive, approval for any of their product candidates or fail to maintain regulatory approval of products, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected. Additionally, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve of our facilities for the manufacture of a customer product or if it withdraws such approval in the future, our customers may choose to identify alternative manufacturing facilities and/or relationships, which could significantly impact our ability to expand our capacity and capabilities.\nWe depend on spending and demand from our customers for our contract manufacturing and development services and any reduction in spending or demand could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe amount that our customers spend on the development and manufacture of their products or product candidates, particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on outsourcing these services to us, substantially impacts our revenue and profitability. The outcomes of our customers\u2019 research, development and marketing also significantly influence the amount that our customers choose to spend on our services and offerings. Our customers determine the amounts that they will spend on our services based upon, among other things, the clinical and market success of their products, available resources, access to capital and their need to develop new products, which, in turn, depend upon a number of other factors, including their competitors\u2019 research, development and product initiatives and the anticipated market for any new products, as well as clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas. Further, increasing consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry may impact such spending, particularly in the event that any of our customers choose to develop or acquire integrated manufacturing operations. Any reduction in customer spending on development and related services as a result of these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future profitability could decline if we cannot sustain current operating conditions, including maintaining our current facility and equipment utilization and product mix\nOur business is complex and depends upon a number of variables to sustain our profitability, including how well we leverage our fixed manufacturing costs and maintain our product sales mix.\nWe have incurred significant fixed costs to purchase equipment that supports our current and future customer base across a wide range of dosage forms and production scales. For example, in 2020, we launched our clinical trials support services capabilities, which includes preparation of clinical trial supplies, as well as specialized services dedicated to the development and current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, of high-potency products. We depend on our workforce to operate our equipment, and we depend on customers to provide orders that will utilize our equipment. If we are not able to fully utilize our manufacturing capacity due to labor shortages, such as those being experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in customer or product mix, or changes in volume, our margins could be adversely affected. Further, there can be no assurance that our future revenue will be sufficient to ensure the economical operation of our facilities, in which case our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of our commercial products are significantly more profitable than others and may include profit-sharing, royalty or other forms of associated income. As a result, if we experience more growth in products that are less profitable that others, even if our revenues remain consistent or grow overall, we could become less profitable. Sustaining our profitability depends upon us experiencing a similar or more favorable mix of revenue, that will depend upon the nature of the different products and services that we offer and/or our customers' request. If we recognize less revenue from our most profitable products as a percentage of total revenue, our future profitability could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur manufacturing services are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely services to our customers, our business could suffer.\nThe manufacturing services we offer are highly complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. A failure of our quality control systems in our facilities could cause problems to arise in connection with facility operations for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, viral contamination, failure to follow specific manufacturing instructions, protocols and standard operating procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors. Such problems could affect production of a single manufacturing run or a series of runs, requiring the destruction of products, or could halt manufacturing operations altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such incident could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug substance, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other manufacturing runs. With respect to our commercial manufacturing, if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, we may be subject to regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such issues could subject us to litigation, the cost of which could be significant.\nThe consumers of the products we manufacture for our customers may significantly influence our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on, and have no control over, consumer demand for the products we manufacture for our customers. Consumer demand for our customers\u2019 products could be adversely affected by, among other things, delays in health regulatory approval, the inability of our customers to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of their products, the loss of patent and other intellectual property rights protection, the emergence of competing or alternative products, including generic drugs, the degree to which private and government payment subsidies for a particular product offset the cost to consumers and changes in the marketing strategies for such products. If the products we manufacture for our customers do not gain market acceptance, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that continued changes to the healthcare industry, including ongoing healthcare reform, adverse changes in government or private funding of healthcare products and services, legislation or regulations governing the privacy of patient information or patient access to care, or the delivery, pricing or reimbursement of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to purchase fewer services from us or influence the price that others are willing to pay for our services. Changes in the healthcare industry\u2019s pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could also significantly reduce our revenue and profitability.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur operating results may be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations. Our operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in the revenues, including the loss of a major commercial partner or product;\n\u2022the timing of purchasing order patterns, safety stock methodology and habits of our commercial partners;\n\u2022unsuccessful execution, postponement or cancellation of anticipated formulation, development and manufacturing services related to customer projects,\n\u2022variations in the level of expenses related to our production volumes and development programs;\n\u2022any intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u2022CDMO or pharmaceutical competitors that introduce new products or take increased positions that may emerge and reduce market share for our existing customer/partner products;\n\u2022our execution of any additional collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022our acquisition, divestiture, spin-off or in-licensing of new technologies or assets.\nDue to the various factors mentioned above, and others, the results of any prior quarterly period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance. If our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, and stock price.\nGlobal financial markets have recently and may continue to experience extreme volatility and disruptions, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, political unrest and other factors beyond control. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy and ability to raise capital may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment, or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance, and stock price. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current customers, vendors or other partners may not survive these difficult economic times, which could directly affect our business.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in decreased stock prices for many companies notwithstanding the lack of a fundamental change in their underlying business models or prospects. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Further, the impacts of political unrest, including as a result geopolitical tension, such as a deterioration in the relationship between the United States and China or escalation in conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including any additional sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that may be imposed by the United States and/or other countries against governmental or other entities in, for example, Russia, also could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in the global markets, which may have an adverse impact on our business or ability to access the capital markets. Broad market and industry factors, including potentially worsening economic conditions and other adverse effects, or developments relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, political, regulatory, and other market conditions, may negatively affect the market price of shares of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe have a history of losses. If we cannot maintain profitability and secure additional business, we may have to raise additional capital.\nWe have incurred losses of $11.4 million, $27.5 million and $18.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $245.8 million. We have financed our operations through the issuance of debt and equity and through operations, and as of December 31, 2021, we had $106.5 million of outstanding indebtedness, $100.0 million of which was with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition LP, or Athyrium. Although it is difficult to forecast all of our future liquidity requirements, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our projected cash receipts from services generated under our customer contracts will be sufficient to fund our operations beyond one year after the date our financial statements are issued. In addition, in the event a customer timely cancels its commitments prior to our initiation of manufacturing services, we may be required to refund some or all of the advance payments made to us under those canceled commitments, which would have a negative impact on our liquidity and future revenue.\nIn the event we are unable to maintain sufficient business to support our current operations, we may need to raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that equity financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to raise additional capital in the equity markets to fund our future operations is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the market demand for our common stock. The market demand or liquidity of our common stock is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, our financial results and economic and market conditions. In addition, even if we are able to raise additional capital, it may not be at a price or on terms that are favorable to us.\nWe have incurred significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding indebtedness of $106.5 million. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our shareholders. For example, it:\n\u2022increases our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022reduces proceeds we may receive as a result of any sale;\n\u2022makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as our largest debt instrument with Athyrium is at a variable rate;\n\u2022limits our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing in the future for working capital or other purposes; and\n\u2022places us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nAny of the above-listed factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our credit agreement with Athyrium also contains certain financial and other covenants, including a minimum liquidity requirement and maximum leverage ratios and includes limitations on, among other things, additional indebtedness, paying dividends in certain circumstances, acquisitions and certain investments. The credit agreement provides for certain mandatory prepayment events, including with respect to the proceeds of asset sales, extraordinary receipts, debt issuances and other specified events, based on the terms of the credit agreement with Athyrium. Any failure to comply with the terms, covenants and conditions of the credit agreement may limit our ability to draw upon additional tranches of term loans and may result in an event of default under such agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and competition may adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in a market that is highly competitive. Our competition in the contract manufacturing market includes full-service contract manufacturers and large pharmaceutical companies offering third-party manufacturing services to fill their excess capacity. We may also compete with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical companies that choose to source their product offerings internally. In addition, most of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or other resources than we do. Moreover, additional competition may emerge, particularly in lower-cost jurisdictions such as India and China, which could, among other things, result in a decrease in the fees paid for our services, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to risks arising from the international scope of our manufacturing and supply relationships.\nSome of our customers source raw materials outside the United States. As such, we are subject to risks associated with such international manufacturing relationships, including:\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022problems related to markets with different cultural biases or political systems;\n\u2022longer payment cycles and shipping lead-times;\n\u2022increased risk relating to the transport of products internationally, including damage to our customers\u2019 API, shipment delays relating to the import or export of our products or the delivery of products by means of additional third-party vendors;\n\u2022difficulties importing or exporting supplies or products;\n\u2022unforeseen global instability, including political instability, such as a deterioration in the relationship between the US and China or escalation in conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including any additional resulting sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that may be imposed by the US and/or other countries against governmental or other entities in, for example, Russia, or instability from an outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease (including, for example, the recent coronavirus outbreak);\n\u2022compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws and regulations governing international trade;\n\u2022changes to U.S. and foreign trade policies, including the enactment of tariffs on goods imported into the United States; and\n\u2022imposition of domestic and international customs and tariffs, withholding or other taxes, including any value added taxes.\nAdditionally, we are subject to periodic reviews and audits by governmental authorities responsible for administering import/export regulations. To the extent that we are unable to successfully defend against an audit or review, we may be required to pay assessments, penalties, and increased duties on products imported into the United States.\nIssues with product quality could have a material adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.\nOur success depends upon the quality of our products. Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our customers' product candidates and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of their product candidates. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our future products, which may result in difficulty in successfully launching product candidates and the loss of sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur development and formulation services projects are typically for a shorter term than our manufacturing projects, and any failure by us to maintain an adequate volume of development and formulation services projects, including due to lower than expected success rates of the products for which we provide services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur pharmaceutical development services business contracts are generally shorter in term than our manufacturing contracts and typically require us to provide development services within a designated scope. Since our development and formulation services focus on products that are still in developmental stages, their viability depends on the ability of such products to reach their respective subsequent development phases. In many cases, such products do not reach subsequent development phases and, as a result, the profitability of the related pharmaceutical development service project may be limited. Even if a customer wishes to proceed with a project, the product we are developing on such customer\u2019s behalf may fail to receive necessary regulatory approval or may have its development hindered by other factors, such as the development of a competing product.\nIf we are unable to continue to or timely obtain new projects from existing and new customers, our development and formulation services business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, although our development and formulation services business may act as a pipeline for our manufacturing services business, we cannot predict the conversion rate of our development and formulation services projects to commercial manufacturing services projects, or how successful we will be in winning new projects that lead to a viable product. As such, an increase in the turnover rate of our development and formulation services projects may not benefit our manufacturing services business at a later time.\nIn addition, our backlog is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including risk that a customer timely cancels its commitments, the risk that a customer may experience delays in its program(s) or otherwise, which could result in the postponement or cancellation of anticipated formulation, development and manufacturing services revenue. There is risk that our business development efforts may not materialize as quickly as we have projected, that we may not successfully execute on all customer projects, any of which could have a negative impact on our liquidity, reported backlog and future revenue. Further, the discontinuation of a project as a result of our failure to satisfy a customer\u2019s requirements may also affect our ability to obtain future projects from such customer, as well as from new customers. Any failure by us to maintain a high volume of development and formulation services projects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, we could incur substantial costs and a reduction in revenues.\nWe are required to maintain compliance with cGMP, and our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspections by the FDA and other global regulators to confirm such compliance. Changes of suppliers or modifications of methods of manufacturing may require amending our application(s) to the FDA and acceptance of the change by the FDA prior to release of our manufactured products. Because we produce multiple products at our manufacturing facilities, there are increased risks associated with cGMP compliance. While we remain committed to continuous improvement and strengthening our quality system and ensuring that all aspects of the system are in full compliance, we can provide no assurance that we will not encounter future inspections resulting in observations not acceptable by the FDA.\nOur inability to demonstrate ongoing cGMP compliance could require us to engage in additional lengthy and expensive remediation efforts, withdraw or recall products and/or interrupt commercial supply of any products. Any delay, interruption or other issue that arises in the manufacture, fill/finish, packaging, or storage of any drug product as a result of a failure of our facilities to pass any regulatory agency inspection or maintain cGMP compliance could significantly impair our relationships with our commercial partners, which would substantially harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Any ongoing or additional findings of non-compliance could also increase our costs and cause us to lose revenue from manufactured products, which could be seriously detrimental to our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our manufacturing activities are subject to the Controlled Substances Act and the regulations of the DEA. Accordingly, we must adhere to a number of requirements with respect to controlled substances, including registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements; labeling and packaging requirements; security controls, procurement and manufacturing quotas; and certain restrictions on refills. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements can result in an enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.\nManufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of substantial user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, for compliance with cGMP regulations and adherence to commitments made in the NDA or the application for marketing authorization. If we, or a regulatory authority, discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with a facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market, suspension of manufacturing, or other FDA action or other action by the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries.\nWe have manufactured opioid products and may manufacture them in the future, which are subject to additional scrutiny and regulation by state and federal law enforcement and other regulatory agencies.\nWe have manufactured opioid products containing hydrocodone and may manufacture opioids in the future. The U.S. government and state legislatures have prioritized combatting the growing misuse and addiction to opioids such as hydrocodone and have enacted legislation and regulations as well as other measures intended to fight the opioid epidemic. Addressing prescription drug abuse is a priority for the current U.S. administration and the FDA and is part of a broader initiative led by the Department of Health and Human Services. Overall, there is greater scrutiny of entities involved in the manufacture, sale and distribution of opioids. These initiatives, existing regulations, potential legal actions against us and/or any negative publicity related to opioids may have a material impact on our business and our ability to manufacture opioid products in the future.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur operations involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future. Even if we comply with applicable laws, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials or chemicals. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our contract manufacturing operations, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully offer new services.\nIn order to successfully compete, we will need to offer and develop new services. Without the timely introduction of enhanced or new services, our services and capabilities may become obsolete over time, in which case, our revenues and operating results would suffer. The related development costs may require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability, and we may not have the financial resources to fund such initiatives.\nIn addition, the success of enhanced or new services will depend on several factors, including but not limited to our ability to:\n\u2022properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, including increasing demand for lower cost services;\n\u2022enhance, innovate, develop and manufacture new offerings in an economical and timely manner;\n\u2022differentiate our deliverables from competitors\u2019 offerings;\n\u2022meet quality requirements, authorization requirements, and other regulatory requirements of government agencies; and\n\u2022avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nEven if we were to succeed in creating enhanced or new services, those services may not result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenues in excess of the costs of development and capital investment and may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or by technologies or features offered by our competitors. In addition, innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace due to, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or third-party reimbursement. If we are not able to offer new services and effectively compete, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nTechnological change may cause our offerings to become obsolete over time. A decrease in our customers\u2019 purchases of our offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Demand for our services may change in ways that we may not anticipate because of evolving industry standards or as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied or because of the introduction by competitors of new services and technologies. We may also need to purchase additional equipment, some of which can take several months or more to procure, install and validate, and increase or modify our manufacturing, maintenance, software and computing capabilities to meet changing demand. In addition, we require capital and resources to support the maintenance and improvement of our facilities, including replacing or repairing aging production equipment and updating overall facility master plans. If we are unable to maintain and improve our facilities, we may experience unscheduled equipment downtime and unpredicted machinery failure and become unable to supply our customers with products or services which may affect business continuity. Any such incident or disruption in business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other events that disrupt our business operations, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur manufacturing facilities are located in Gainesville, Georgia and San Diego, California, where natural disasters or similar events, like hurricanes, blizzards, tornadoes, fires, floods, earthquakes or explosions or large-scale accidents or power outages, could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. If a disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our Gainesville and/or San Diego facilities, damaged critical infrastructures, such as manufacturing resource planning and enterprise quality systems, or otherwise disrupted operations at that location, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our development, formulation and manufacturing business for a substantial period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCurrently, we maintain insurance coverage against damage to our property and equipment, and to cover business interruption expenses, in an amount we believe is sufficient for our development, formulation and manufacturing operations. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against actual losses. Even if we maintain adequate insurance coverage, claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on our ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.\nWe must comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies concerning the environment and the health and safety of our employees. Although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, our business involves the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals, solvents, agents and biohazardous materials. As a result, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by those regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. We currently contract with third parties to dispose of these substances that we generate, and we rely on these third parties to properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If these third parties do not properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to legal action by governmental agencies or private parties for improper disposal of these substances. The costs of defending such actions and the potential liability resulting from such actions are often very large. In the event we are subject to such legal action or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any such liability could exceed our resources. In addition, although we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees, including those resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. If we become subject to any of the foregoing liabilities, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to litigation or government investigations for a variety of claims, which could adversely affect our operating results, harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nWe may be subject to litigation or government investigations. These may include claims, lawsuits, and proceedings involving product liability, labor and employment, wage and hour, commercial and other matters. For example, we are subject to securities class action litigation as discussed further in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The outcome of any litigation or government investigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Any lawsuits or government investigations, and the disposition of such lawsuits and government investigations, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and divert management attention and resources. Any adverse determination related to litigation or government investigations could adversely affect our operating results, harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, a resolution of a legal matter or government investigation could materially affect our future operating results, our cash flows or both.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our key executives as well as to attract, retain and motivate other qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our executive team and, in particular, the services of J. David Enloe, Jr., our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ryan Lake, our Chief Financial Officer, the loss of whose services would adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. We have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers. Recruiting and retaining qualified employees for our business, including business development, scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical companies for individuals with similar skill sets. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive or key employee could impede the progress of our business development, manufacturing, quality, growth and diversification objectives.\nWe may acquire other assets or businesses, or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies, that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of assets, including, businesses or strategic alliances and collaborations, to expand our existing technologies and operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Integration of an acquired company or assets may also disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, especially the acquisition of commercial assets, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business.\nTo finance any acquisitions or collaborations, we may choose to issue debt or shares of our common or preferred stock as consideration. Any such issuance of shares would dilute the ownership of our shareholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other assets or companies or fund a transaction using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nOur employees, partners, independent contractors, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, partners, independent contractors, consultants and vendors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity with respect to our business. Misconduct by these employees, partners, independent contractors, consultants and vendors could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates: (1) FDA or DEA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA; (2) manufacturing standards; (3) federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (4) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. Any incidents or any other conduct that leads to an employee receiving an FDA debarment could result in a loss of business from our partners and severe reputational harm. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe face potential product liability claims, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.\nThe use of our products exposes us to the risk of product liability claims as well as potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022impairment of our business reputation and negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of our customers clinical study participants or adverse effects occurring during such clinical trials;\n\u2022costs due to related litigation;\n\u2022distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022decreased demand for our manufacturing services or loss of any of our commercial partners;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022the inability of our customers to commercialize their product candidates; and\n\u2022increased scrutiny and potential investigation by, among others, the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, State Attorneys General, members of Congress and the public.\nOur current product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLs, of approximately $135.9 million and $137.7 million, respectively. The federal carry forwards for 2008 through 2017 will expire in 2028 through 2037. Federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and onward have an indefinite expiration under the 2017 Tax Cut & Jobs Act. The state carry forwards, including those generated in 2021, will expire in 2028 through 2041. A full allowance for the value of the NOLs is provided for in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021. We cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the benefit we may receive from the NOLs, if any, will be.\nWe incur increased costs and demands upon our management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe are a public company and, as such, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements and liability insurance for our directors and officers. We also incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including certain of the requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market, the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. If we fail to comply with current corporate governance requirements, our business may be negatively affected, including by having our common stock delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nThe expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically in recent years. We expect these rules and regulations to continue to significantly impact our legal, insurance and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We are unable to currently estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. We also expect that these rules and regulations may make it difficult and expensive for us to continue to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and if we are able to maintain such insurance, we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage available to privately-held companies. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors, or the board, or as our executive officers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe security of our information technology systems may be compromised in the event of system failures, unauthorized access, cyberattacks or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, and confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain, could be improperly disclosed.\nWe rely extensively on information technology and systems including internet sites, data hosting, physical security, and software applications and platforms. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, power outages, user errors or catastrophic events. A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems, by our employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact or interrupt operations. For example, the loss of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for product candidates could result in delays in regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. The use of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our systems or our third-party systems. We could also experience a business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from malware or other cyberattacks, which may compromise our systems or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers.\nAs part of our business, we maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on our employees. The maintenance of such information is governed by various rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, including by the General Data Privacy Regulation, or GDPR, in the European Union. Breaches in security, either internally or at our third-party providers, could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, interruption to our operations, damage to our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we believe we have appropriate information security policies and systems in place in order to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur.\nAny such business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from malware or other cyberattacks, or violation of personal information laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that address privacy and data security of patients who use our product candidates in the United States and in states in which we conduct our business. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act) govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. For instance, HIPAA imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and imposes notification obligations in the event of a breach of the privacy or security of individually identifiable health information on entities subject to HIPAA and their business associates that perform certain activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on their behalf. Failure to comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us, which could include civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nPotential indemnification obligations to Baudax Bio or a refusal of Baudax Bio to indemnify us pursuant to agreements executed in the spin-off could materially adversely affect us.\nOn November 21, 2019, we distributed all of the then outstanding shares of Baudax Bio common stock to our shareholders in connection with the separation of our Acute Care business. In connection with the distribution, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements (including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, a manufacturing and supply agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement and certain other commercial agreements). These agreements governed the separation and distribution and the relationship between the two companies going forward, including with respect to potential tax-related losses associated with the separation and distribution. They also provided for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time.\nThe separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Baudax Bio financially responsible for any liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the distribution, including any pending or future litigation. It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and Baudax Bio and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Baudax Bio. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations, and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations. Even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification, we may have to bear costs temporarily. In addition, our indemnity obligations to Baudax Bio may be significant. These risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, which may be affected by applicable government vaccine mandates.\nThe implementation of any government-mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees and attract new employees. Courts are currently considering a broad set of legal challenges to those vaccine mandates that make it difficult for us to plan how, when, or even if we should enforce those mandates. For example, in November 2021, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, issued an emergency temporary standard requiring employers with at least 100 employees to require their employees to get vaccinated or submit to regular\nCOVID-19 testing. OSHA subsequently withdrew the vaccination and testing emergency temporary standard effective January 2022 following a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States.\nAs a party to certain contracts with the federal government, we are currently subject to federal COVID-19 vaccine mandates separate from the OSHA standard. These vaccine mandates are currently being reviewed by the federal courts, with several federal district courts issuing injunctions against enforcement of the mandates. If, after all appeals are exhausted, such mandates are permitted to be enforced, they may present certain risks regarding our ability to attract or retain talent, including the willingness of our employees to comply with such mandates and the potential conflict with actions by certain states in which we operate that are in conflict with the federal mandate. All of our active employees subject to the federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate have presented proof of vaccination to us as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 15% of our workforce not subject to the federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate was unvaccinated. If future mandates are enacted that cover those employees, a significant number of them could choose not to comply with applicable mandates. If we are forced to terminate their employment as a result, our business could be materially harmed. The inability to recruit or the loss of the services of any executive or key employee could impede the progress of our business development, manufacturing, quality, growth and diversification objectives.\nOur U.S. government contracts require compliance with numerous laws that may present additional risk and liability.\nWe provide services to the National Institutes of Health, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. As a result, we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. U.S. government contracts typically contain a number of extraordinary provisions that would not typically be found in commercial contracts and which may create a disadvantage and additional risks to us as compared to competitors that do not rely on government contracts. As a U.S. government service provider and subcontractor, we are subject to increased risks of investigation, audit, criminal prosecution, and other legal actions and liabilities to which purely private sector companies are not. The results of any such actions could adversely impact our business and have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nAdditionally, a violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts, as well as suspension or debarment. The suspension or debarment in any particular case may be limited to the facility, contract or subsidiary involved in the violation or could be applied to our entire enterprise in certain severe circumstances. Even a narrow scope suspension or debarment could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our ability to renew contracts and to secure new contracts, both with the U.S. government and private customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims, among other potential violations. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm and the value of our common stock could be negatively affected if allegations of impropriety related to such contracts are made against us.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nLitigation involving patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights is expensive and time-consuming. If we are involved in such litigation, it could interfere with our business.\nOur success depends in part on not infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Although we are not currently aware of litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our technologies or business activities, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.\nIn a patent infringement claim against us, we may assert, as a defense, that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims, that the patent is invalid or both. The strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted, the interpretation of these patents and/or our ability to invalidate the asserted patents. However, we could be unsuccessful in advancing non-infringement and/or invalidity arguments in our defense. In the United States, issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity, and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. Conversely, the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence, which is a low burden of proof.\nIf we were found by a court to have infringed a valid patent claim, we could be prevented from using the patented technology or be required to pay the owner of the patent for the right to license the patented technology. If we decide to pursue a license to one or more of these patents, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or the license we obtain may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patent rights. For example, if the relevant patent is owned by a competitor, that competitor may choose not to license patent rights to us. If we decide to develop alternative technology, we may not be able to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all.\nIn addition, because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time, there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our products.\nIt is possible that we may in the future receive, particularly as a public company, communications from competitors and other companies alleging that we may be infringing their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights, offering licenses to such intellectual property or threatening litigation. In addition to patent infringement claims, third parties may assert copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights against us. We may need to expend considerable resources to counter such claims and may not be able to be successful in our defense. Our business may suffer if a finding of infringement is established.\nGeneric competitors can challenge the U.S. patents protecting our commercial partners\u2019 product candidates by filing an ANDA or an NDA for a generic or a modified version of our commercial partners\u2019 product candidates.\nSeparate and apart from the protection provided under the U.S. patent laws, drug candidates may be subject to the provisions of the Hatch- Waxman Act, which may provide drug candidates with either a three- or five-year period of marketing exclusivity following receipt of FDA approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits the FDA from accepting the filing of an ANDA application (for a generic product) or a 505(b)(2) NDA (for a modified version of the product) for three years for active drug ingredients previously approved by the FDA or for five years for active drug ingredients not previously approved by the FDA.\nThere is an exception, however, for newly approved molecules that allows competitors to challenge a patent beginning four years into the five-year exclusivity period by alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the FDA\u2019s list of approved drug products are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed and submitting an ANDA for a generic version of a drug candidate. This patent challenge is commonly known as a Paragraph IV certification. Within the past several years, the generic industry has aggressively pursued approvals of generic versions of innovator drugs at the earliest possible point in time.\nIf a generic company is able to successfully challenge the patents covering drug candidates by obtaining FDA approval for an ANDA, the generic company may choose to launch a generic version of a drug candidate. Any launch of a generic version of our commercial partners' products prior to the expiration of patent protection will have a material adverse effect on demand for that product, our revenues and our results of operations.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged in the United States to date. The pharmaceutical patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents that may be issued from the applications we currently or may in the future own or license from third parties. Further, if any patent license we obtain is deemed invalid and/or unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or partner our technology.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u2022we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022an individual or party will not challenge inventorship, that if successful, could have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022any patents issued to us or our collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties; or\n\u2022the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may possess, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe may rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects on our competitive business position.\nOur ability to manufacture products for our commercial partners may be impaired if any of our manufacturing activities, or the activities of third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain, are found to infringe patents of others.\nOur ability to continue to manufacture products for our commercial partners, to utilize third parties to supply raw materials or other products, or to perform fill/finish services or other steps in our manufacture and supply chain, depends on our and their ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of others. Other parties may allege that our manufacturing activities, or the activities of third parties involved in our manufacturing and supply chain, infringe patents or other intellectual property rights. A judicial decision in favor of one or more parties making such allegations could preclude the manufacture of the products to which those intellectual property rights apply, which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications.\nWe have systems in place to remind us to pay periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other patent and application fees, and we employ an outside law firm to pay these fees. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ an outside law firm and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property. If we are unable to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nAny trademarks we have obtained or may obtain may be infringed or successfully challenged, resulting in harm to our business.\nWe expect to rely on trademarks as one means to distinguish any of our products that are approved for marketing from the products of our competitors. Once we select new trademarks and apply to register them, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may oppose or attempt to cancel our trademark applications or trademarks, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our drugs, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock have been and may continue to be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our shareholders.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate or may decline significantly in the future. An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock or cause it to continue to be highly volatile or subject to wide fluctuations. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include, among other things:\n\u2022FDA, state or international regulatory actions, including actions on regulatory applications for any of our commercial partners\u2019 product candidates;\n\u2022legislative or regulatory changes;\n\u2022judicial pronouncements interpreting laws and regulations;\n\u2022changes in government programs;\n\u2022announcements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in demand for or pricing of our customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022the sales ramp and trajectory for our formulation, development and manufacturing services;\n\u2022market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles;\n\u2022litigation or public concern about the safety of our products or similar products;\n\u2022sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders;\n\u2022our announcement of financing transactions, including debt, convertible notes, etc.; and\n\u2022actions by institutional or activist shareholders.\nThese broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and decreases in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Following the decrease in our trading price in May 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our officers and directors for alleged violations of Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10(b)(5) promulgated thereunder. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs. On December 10, 2018, lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint that asserted the same claims and sought the same relief but included new allegations and named additional officers and directors as defendants. On February 8, 2019, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety which the lead plaintiff opposed on April 9, 2019. On May 9, 2019, we filed our response and briefing was completed on the motion to dismiss. In response to questions from the Judge, the parties submitted supplemental briefs with regard to the motion to dismiss the amended complaint during the fall of 2019. On February 18, 2020, the motion to dismiss was granted without prejudice. On April 25, 2020, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on June 18, 2020. The plaintiff filed an opposition to our motion to dismiss on August 17, 2020 and on September 16, 2020, we filed a reply in support of our motion to dismiss. The plaintiff filed an opposition to our motion to dismiss on August 17, 2020. On September 16, 2020, we filed a reply in support of our motion to dismiss. On March 1, 2021, the Court denied our second motion to dismiss. On June 21, 2021, we filed an answer and affirmative defenses to the second amended complaint. Since then, the parties have been engaged in discovery, which must conclude by April 29, 2022. On September 30, 2021, the plaintiff filed a motion for class certification and appointment of class representative. We filed an opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s motion on November 30, 2021. On January 6, 2022, the plaintiff filed a reply in support of the motion for class certification. We requested oral argument on this motion, and the plaintiff has taken the position that the motion can be decided on the papers. Motions for summary judgment must be filed by May 27, 2022. In connection with the separation from Baudax Bio, Baudax Bio accepted assignment from us of all of our obligations in connection with the litigation and agreed to indemnify us for all liabilities related to the litigation. This litigation, and any other securities class actions that may be brought against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to do so for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any return on an investment in our common stock will be realized, if at all, only when shareholders sell their shares. In addition, our failure to pay cash dividends may make our stock less attractive to investors, adversely impacting trading volume and price.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with certain shareholders, our directors and their affiliated entities and our executive officers will limit shareholders\u2019 abilities to influence certain corporate matters.\nOur directors and their affiliated entities, and our executive officers, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 6% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, the former equity holders of IriSys held approximately 16% of our outstanding common stock as of February 25, 2022. As a result, these shareholders are collectively able to influence matters requiring approval of our shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Such influence may delay, prevent or deter a change in control of our company, even when such a change may be in the best interests of some shareholders, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets and might adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Pennsylvania law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders, and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our shareholders, or remove our current management. These include provisions that:\n\u2022divide our board of directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022provide that a special meeting of shareholders may be called only by a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022establish advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals to be brought before a shareholder meeting and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or a committee of the board of director;\n\u2022provide that shareholders may only act at a duly organized meeting; and\n\u2022provide that members of our board of directors may be removed from office by our shareholders only for cause by the affirmative vote of 75% of the total voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Pennsylvania, we are governed by the provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our shareholders. Under Pennsylvania law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 20% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for five years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our articles of incorporation or bylaws or Pennsylvania law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or reports, or if they publish unfavorable research or reports, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If additional securities or industry analysts do not commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of us.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be frequently evaluated. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors (as a smaller reporting company, the latter requirement does not apply). Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14550, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "REPH"}
