RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to numerous risks, many of which are inherent to our business. As a financial services organization, we must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with our business activities. For information about how our risk oversight and management process operates, see Item 7 of this Report, MD&A - \"Risk Management.\u201d The following discussion highlights specific risks that could affect us and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Based on the information currently known, we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting us. The risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Report. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur, these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\n1. Global/Regional Market and Environmental Influences\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments and other factors that are highly uncertain and will be impacted by the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and U.S. economies and financial markets and is having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 has caused death, illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and\nfinancial market instability. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of the states in which we have branch offices, and of most other states, have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes. In many locations throughout the U.S., the spread of COVID-19 decreased substantially throughout the spring and summer of 2021, and as a result, several of the activity restrictions described above were lifted in whole or in part in many jurisdictions. However, due in large part to the increased spread of new, more transmissible COVID-19 variants, the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 has increased substantially. This substantial increase in COVID-19 infections has caused state and local governments of several states to consider, and in some cases implement or reinstate, activity restrictions and measures that previously had been lifted. These restrictions and other consequences of the pandemic have resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses, and have resulted in a significant disruption of the U.S. workforce, including employee resignations, retirements, layoffs and furloughs, which also impacted the regions in which we operate.\nThe ultimate length and effects of COVID-19 and the restrictions described above on the broader economy and the markets that we serve are not known. In response to the economic conditions resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19, the FOMC has taken action to lower the Federal Funds rate nearly to 0%. However, due to rising inflation and corresponding pressure to raise interest rates, in its policy statement issued on January 26, 2022, the FOMC has signaled that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the Federal Funds rate. A change in the Federal Funds rate can affect the difference between the interest that FNBPA can earn on assets and the interest that FNBPA has to pay on liabilities, which impacts FNBPA's overall net interest income and profitability. Additional impacts of COVID-19 on our business could be widespread and material, and may include, or exacerbate, among other consequences, the following:\n\u2022employees, including key executives, and their families contracting COVID-19;\n\u2022reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home;\n\u2022a work stoppage, forced quarantine, or other interruption of our business;\n\u2022unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities;\n\u2022effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating our financial reporting and internal controls;\n\u2022sustained longer-term closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers;\n\u2022declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products;\n\u2022reduced consumer spending due to both job losses and other effects attributable to COVID-19;\n\u2022unprecedented volatility in U.S. financial markets;\n\u2022volatile performance of our investment securities portfolio;\n\u2022decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects of COVID-19 in the markets we serve, leading to a need to increase our ACL and the potential for higher loan losses; and\n\u2022declines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and loan guarantors, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nThese factors, together or in combination with other events or occurrences that are not yet known or anticipated, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe widespread availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines and corresponding rates of vaccination generally have been effective in curtailing the potential more harmful impacts of infection in many parts of the U.S. and, in turn, mitigating many of the adverse social and economic effects of the pandemic; however, a portion of the population remains unvaccinated and the efficacy of the vaccines in preventing infection and serious illness is believed to wane over time and may be diminished in the face of new coronavirus variants. Accordingly, the pandemic, and related efforts to contain it, continue to disrupt global economic activity and functioning of the financial markets, impact interest rates and monetary policy decisions, increase economic and market uncertainty, and disrupt trade and supply chains.\nAdditional COVID-19 outbreaks, spikes and \"subsequent\" waves, new COVID-19 strains and widespread ineffectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines may lead to efforts by federal, state and local governments and health authorities to engage in efforts to contain or mitigate the pandemic's impact.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency may continue to cause significant disruption in the U.S. economy and the U.S. financial and labor markets by imposing or extending restrictions on movement or business activities.\nAdditionally, the failure to provide for additional COVID-19 related stimulus relief may adversely impact our business and financial performance by prolonging the U.S. economic recovery and possibly adversely impact the demand and profitability of our products and services, the valuation of assets and our ability to meet the financial and banking needs of our clients. In late 2021 and continuing into early 2022, the Omicron variant of COVID-19 has spread substantially and rapidly throughout the U.S. and globally. As a result, social and economic activity has been disrupted in many parts of the country.\nInterest rates on our outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on the replacement of LIBOR, which could adversely affect revenue, expenses, and the value of those financial instruments.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that although they have extended the overnight and 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month LIBOR through June 20, 2023, in order to accord financial institutions greater time with which to manage the transition from LIBOR, it is no longer compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. The federal banking agencies, including the OCC, previously determined that banks must cease entering into any new contract that uses LIBOR as a reference rate by no later than December 31, 2021. In addition, banks have been encouraged to identify contracts that extend beyond June 30, 2023 and implement plans to identify and address insufficient contingency provisions in those contracts.\nWhile there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, and the OCC has opined that national banks may use any reference rate for its loans that a bank determines to be appropriate for its funding model and customer needs, the ARRC, a committee of U.S. financial market participants, has recommended the SOFR as the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to U.S. dollar-LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan from LIBOR to SOFR and organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. We have a significant number of loans, derivatives and other financial instrument contracts that are indexed to LIBOR and are actively monitoring this activity and evaluating the related risks. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.\nOur business could be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions in the regions in which we operate.\nWe operate in seven states and the District of Columbia. Our market coverage spans several major metropolitan areas including: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; and Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and the Piedmont Triad (Winston-Salem, Greensboro and High Point) in North Carolina. Most of our customers are individuals and small- and medium-sized businesses that are dependent upon their regional economies. The economic conditions in these local markets may be different from, and in some instances worse than, economic conditions in the U.S. as a whole. Difficult economic and employment conditions in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022demand for our loans, deposits and services may decline;\n\u2022loan delinquencies, problem assets, foreclosures and charge-offs may increase;\n\u2022weak economic conditions could limit the demand for loans by creditworthy borrowers, limiting our capacity to leverage our retail deposits and maintain our net interest income;\n\u2022collateral for our loans may decline in value; and\n\u2022the amount of our low-cost or non-interest-bearing deposits may decrease.\nHurricanes, tornadoes, excessive rainfall, droughts or other adverse weather events could negatively affect the local economies in the markets of our footprint, or disrupt our operations in those markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe economy of the markets in our footprint is affected, from time to time, by adverse weather events. We cannot predict whether, or to what extent, damage caused by future weather conditions will affect our operations, customers or the economies in our markets. Weather events could cause a disruption in our day-to-day business activities in branches within our markets, a decline in loan originations, destruction or decline in the value of properties securing our loans, or an increase in the risks of delinquencies, foreclosures, and loan losses. Even if a weather event does not cause any physical damage in our markets, a significant weather event could affect the market value of property within our footprint, particularly agricultural interests, which are highly sensitive to excessive rainfall or droughts.\n2. Lending\nAs a participating lender in the SBA PPP, we are subject to additional regulatory and DOJ enforcement risks and the risk of litigation from FNBPA\u2019s clients or other parties regarding FNBPA\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nFrom the beginning of the PPP, there has been ambiguity and continuously evolving rules, interpretations and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP and the respective obligations of banks and loan applicants, which has exposed banks to risks relating to non-compliance with the PPP by various government investigative agencies and the DOJ, who are charged with investigating PPP loan fraud and pursuing civil and criminal sanctions. Congress approved additional funding for the PPP and beginning in January 2021, FNBPA elected to participate in the second round of PPP loans. Since the opening of the PPP, several larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP.\nFNBPA also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, underwritten, certified by the borrower, funded, or serviced by FNBPA, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, certified by the borrower, funded, or serviced by FNBPA, the SBA may deny its liability under its loan guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, deny forgiveness of a PPP loan or, if it has already paid under the guaranty or honored the loan forgiveness, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nOur results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans.\nLending money is an essential part of the banking business. However, for various reasons, borrowers do not always repay their loans. The risk of non-payment is affected by:\n\u2022credit risks of a particular borrower;\n\u2022changes in economic conditions that impact certain geographic markets or industries;\n\u2022fluctuations in interest rates on adjustable rate loans;\n\u2022the duration of the loan; and\n\u2022in the case of a collateralized loan, uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral.\nGenerally, commercial loans and leases present a greater risk of non-payment by a borrower than other types of loans. They typically involve larger loan balances and are particularly sensitive to economic conditions. The borrower\u2019s ability to repay usually depends on the successful operation of its business and income stream. In addition, some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us, which means that an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss. In the case of commercial and industrial loans, collateral often consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, which may not yield substantial recovery of principal losses incurred, and is susceptible to deterioration or other loss in advance of liquidation of such collateral. These types of loans, however, have historically driven the growth in our loan portfolio and we intend to continue our lending efforts for commercial and industrial products. At December 31, 2021, commercial loans and leases comprised 65.9% of our loan portfolio and consumer loans comprised 34.1% of our loan portfolio. Consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields compared to real estate mortgage loans, but generally carry higher risks of default. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower\u2019s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. For additional information, see the Lending Activity section of MD&A, which is included in Item 7 of this Report.\nOur mortgage banking profitability could be significantly reduced if we are not able to originate and resell a high volume of mortgage loans.\nMortgage banking is generally considered a volatile source of income because it depends largely on the volume of loans we originate and sell in the secondary market. If our originations of mortgage loans decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors, this would result in a decrease in mortgage revenues and a corresponding decrease in non-interest income.\n\u2022Mortgage loan production levels are sensitive to changes in economic conditions and activity, strengths or weaknesses in the housing market, interest rate fluctuations and the availability of an active secondary market. Generally, any sustained period of decreased economic activity or higher interest rates could reduce demand for mortgage loans and refinancings. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of non-interest expense associated with mortgage banking activities, such as salaries, commissions and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations.\n\u2022Future changes to our eligibility to participate in the programs offered by the GSEs and other secondary purchasers, or the loan criteria of the GSEs and other secondary purchasers could also result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we must further increase our provision for credit losses or if our ACL is not sufficient to absorb actual losses.\nThere is no precise method of predicting loan losses. We can give no assurance that our ACL will be sufficient to absorb actual loan losses. Excess loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We attempt to maintain an appropriate ACL to provide for estimated current expected credit losses in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding reporting date based on various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio. We regularly determine the amount of our ACL based upon consideration of several quantitative and qualitative factors including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022a regular review of the quality, mix and size of the overall loan portfolio;\n\u2022historical loan loss experience;\n\u2022evaluation of non-performing loans;\n\u2022geographic or industry concentrations;\n\u2022assessment of economic conditions and their effects on FNB\u2019s existing portfolio;\n\u2022the amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing loans; and\n\u2022geographic or industry economic market conditions.\nThe level of the ACL reflects the judgment and estimates of management regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, current fair value of the underlying collateral and other qualitative risk factors that may affect the loan. Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective and is based on factors that are susceptible to significant change. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the ACL. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our ACL and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the ACL, we will need additional provisions to increase the ACL. Any increases in the ACL will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For additional discussion relating to this matter, refer to the Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses section of MD&A, which is included in Item 7 of this Report.\nChanges in economic conditions, the impact of COVID-19 and the composition of our loan portfolio could lead to higher loan charge-offs or an increase in our provision for credit losses and may reduce our net income.\nChanges in national and regional economic conditions, and in large metropolitan areas within our market, including the economic impact of COVID-19, continue to impact our loan portfolios. For example, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values or changes in interest rates, as well as other factors, could weaken the economies of the communities we serve. Weakness in our market areas could depress our earnings and consequently our financial condition because customers may not want or need our products or services; borrowers may not be able to repay their loans; the value of the collateral securing our loans to borrowers may decline; and the quality of our loan portfolio may decline. Any of the latter three scenarios could require us to charge-off a higher percentage of our loans and/or increase our provision for credit losses, which would reduce our net income. Additionally, changes to macroeconomic conditions and the related CECL modeling considerations may result in volatility in our provision from period to period.\n3. Growth Trends\nIf we are not able to continue our historical levels of growth, we may not be able to maintain our historical revenue trends.\nTo achieve our past levels of growth, we have focused on both organic growth and acquisitions. We may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all. More specifically, we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition, may impede or prohibit the opening of new retail branches or optimizing our existing branch network. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers, which could adversely affect our organic growth. If we are not able to continue our historical levels of growth, we may not be able to maintain our historical revenue trends.\nIn July 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy which encouraged the federal banking agencies to review their current merger oversight practices. The Executive Order has received significant public support from members of Congress as well as a majority of the board members of the FDIC. In addition, the Director of the CFPB has publicly sought a greater role for the CFPB in the evaluation of proposed bank mergers. Any enhanced regulatory scrutiny of bank mergers and acquisitions and revision of the framework for merger application review may adversely affect the marketplace for such transactions, could result in future applications being delayed, impeded or restricted in certain respects and could result in new rules that possibly limit the size of financial institutions we may be able to acquire in the future or alter the terms for such transactions.\nOur growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations (see discussion under \u201cGovernment Supervision and Regulation\u201d included in Item 1 of this Report). As a financial holding company, we seek to maintain capital sufficient to meet the \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standard set by regulators. We anticipate that our current capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We may at some point, however, need to raise additional capital to support continued growth, whether such growth occurs organically or through acquisitions.\nThe availability of additional capital or financing will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, marketability of our stock, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large credit losses or if the level of business activity decreases due to economic conditions. Accordingly, there can be no assurance of our ability to expand our operations through organic growth or acquisitions. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than desired or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, it could be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\n4. Regulations, Tax Laws and Political Impacts\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations.\nOur income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items. The current Presidential Administration's approach to corporate tax rates could affect our future results of operations. During 2021, Congress debated various proposals for increase in the corporate tax rate and possible surcharges on corporate share repurchases as part of the funding of various spending initiatives. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the federal tax rates and in tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, or by changes in the valuation of our DTAs and DTLs. Changes in statutory tax rates or DTAs and DTLs may adversely affect our profitability and results of operations in future periods.\nOur business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market rates and changes in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the UST and the FRB, have a direct impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which we have no control and which may not be able to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.\nAs a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates can\nhave a material effect on our business, profitability and the value of our financial assets and liabilities. Such scenarios may include the following:\n\u2022changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that FNBPA can earn on assets and the interest that FNBPA has to pay on liabilities, which impacts FNBPA\u2019s overall net interest income and profitability;\n\u2022such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments and can, in turn, affect our loss rates on those assets;\n\u2022such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate-based products or services, including bank loans and deposit products and the subordinated notes offered by our subsidiary, FNB Financial Services, LP;\n\u2022such changes can also affect our ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risks and may decrease the profitability or increase the risk associated with such hedges; and\n\u2022movements in interest rates also affect mortgage repayment speeds and could result in impairments of MSAs or otherwise affect the profitability of such assets.\nThe monetary, tax and other policies of the U.S. Government and its agencies also have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. Due to rising inflation and corresponding pressure to raise interest rates, in its FOMC policy statement issued on January 26, 2022, the FRB signaled that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the Federal Funds rate. These potential actions of the FRB influence the rates of interest that FNBPA may charge on loans and what FNBPA may pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of FNB\u2019s and FNBPA\u2019s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Principally due to the impact of rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the FRB, the FRB\u2019s policies also influence to a significant extent, FNBPA\u2019s cost of funding. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, fiscal, tax and other policies or the effects that may be implemented by the current Administration or a future Administration and the impacts they may have on our activities and financial results.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting policies, standards and interpretations.\nThe FASB, regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls.\nChanges in the federal, state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe are subject to legislative tax rate changes that could increase our effective tax rates. Depending on enactment dates, these law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. For example, the TCJA resulted in a reduction in our corporate tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018, which has a favorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities. In addition, the TCJA also enacted limitations on certain deductions, such as the deduction of FDIC deposit insurance premiums, which partially offset the increase in net earnings from the lower tax rate. The impact of the TCJA may differ from the foregoing, possibly materially, due to changes in interpretations or in assumptions that we have made, guidance or regulations that may be promulgated, and other actions that we may take as a result of the TCJA. Similarly, our customers are likely to experience varying effects from both the individual and business tax provisions of the TCJA and such effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding impact on our business and the economy as a whole.\nCongress had recently debated various proposals for increases in the corporate tax rate and possible surcharges on corporate share repurchases. Any such increase in the corporate tax rate or surcharges would adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\nWe are subject to environmental, social and governance risks that could adversely affect our reputation and the market price of our securities.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks arising from environmental, social and governance matters or \u201cESG\u201d matters. ESG matters include climate risk, hiring practices, the diversity of our work force, and racial and social justice issues involving our personnel, customers and third parties with whom we otherwise do business. Risks arising from ESG matters may adversely affect, among other things, our reputation and the market price of our securities.\nFurther, we may be exposed to negative publicity based on the identity and activities of those to whom we lend and with which we otherwise do business, and the public\u2019s view of the approach and performance of our customers and business partners with respect to ESG matters. Any such negative publicity could arise from adverse news coverage in traditional media and could also spread through the use of social media platforms. Our relationships and reputation with our existing and prospective customers and third parties with whom we do business could be damaged if we were to become the subject of any such negative publicity. This, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and could have a negative impact on the market price for our securities.\nInvestors have begun to consider the steps taken and resources allocated by financial institutions and other commercial organizations to address ESG matters when making investment and operational decisions. Certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies\u2019 responses to the risks posed by climate change and other ESG matters into their investment theses. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the market price of our securities to the extent that investors determine that we have not made sufficient progress on ESG matters.\nClimate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact our business.\nThe current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. Such initiatives have been pursued with rigor under the current Presidential Administration. The FSOC, of which the OCC is a member, published a report in October 2021 identifying climate-related financial risk as an \u201cemerging threat\u201d to financial stability. The leadership of the federal banking agencies, including the Comptroller of the Currency, have emphasized that climate-related risks are faced by banking organizations of all types and sizes, specifically including physical and transition risks, and are in the process of enhancing supervisory expectations regarding banks' risk management practices. To that end, in December 2021, the OCC published proposed principles for climate risk management by larger banking organizations. The OCC also has appointed its first ever Climate Change Risk Officer and established an internal climate risk implementation committee in order to assist with these initiatives and to support the agency\u2019s efforts to enhance its supervision of climate change risk management.\nThe above measures may also result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits, and the implementation of significant operational changes, each of which may require us to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Given the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change, it is impossible to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations; however, as a banking organization, the physical effects of climate change may present certain unique risks to us.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in the law, especially changes in the regulation of the banking industry.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and our businesses are subject to supervision and regulation by several governmental agencies, including the SEC, FRB, OCC, CFPB, FDIC, FSOC, DOJ, UST, FINRA, HUD and state attorneys general and banking, financial services, and securities regulators. Regulations are generally intended to provide protection for depositors, borrowers and other customers, as well as the stability of the financial services industry, rather than for investors in our securities. We are subject to changes in federal and state law, regulations, governmental policies, agency supervisory and enforcement policies and priorities, and tax laws and accounting principles. Changes in regulations or the regulatory environment could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry as a whole and could limit our growth and the return to investors by restricting such activities as, for example:\n\u2022the payment of dividends and stock repurchases;\n\u2022balance sheet growth;\n\u2022investments;\n\u2022loans and interest rates;\n\u2022assessments of fees, such as overdraft and electronic transfer interchange fees;\n\u2022the provision of securities, insurance, brokerage or trust services;\n\u2022mergers with or acquisitions of other institutions or branches;\n\u2022the types of deposit and non-deposit activities in which our subsidiaries may engage; and\n\u2022offering of new products and services.\nUnder regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements, FNB and FNBPA must meet guidelines subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to those regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. Changes to present capital and liquidity requirements could restrict our activities and require us to maintain additional capital. Compliance with heightened capital standards may reduce our ability to generate or originate revenue-producing assets and thereby restrict revenue generation from banking and non-banking operations. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur overdraft protection programs and corresponding revenue may be impacted by possible new federal regulatory requirements or scrutiny or industry trends regarding such practices.\nIn recent months, certain members of Congress and the leadership of the OCC and CFPB have expressed a heightened interest in bank overdraft protection programs. In December 2021, the CFPB published a report providing data on banks\u2019 overdraft and non-sufficient funds fee revenues as well as observations regarding consumer protection issues relating to participation in such programs. The CFPB has indicated that it intends to pursue enforcement actions against banking organizations, and their executives, that oversee overdraft practices that are deemed to be unlawful. In addition, the OCC has identified potential options for reform of national bank overdraft protection practices, including providing a grace period before the imposition of a fee, refraining from charging multiple fees in a single day and eliminating fees altogether.\nIn response to this increased congressional and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, and in anticipation of possible enhanced supervision and enforcement of overdraft protection practices in the future, certain banking organizations have begun to modify their overdraft protection programs, including by discontinuing the imposition of overdraft transaction fees. These competitive pressures from our peers, as well as any adoption by our regulators of new rules or supervisory guidance or more aggressive examination and enforcement policies in respect of banks\u2019 overdraft protection practices, could cause us to modify our program and practices in ways that may have a negative impact on our revenue and earnings. In addition, as supervisory expectations and industry practices regarding overdraft protection programs change, our continued offering of overdraft protection may result in negative public opinion and increased reputation risk.\nCertain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws and Pennsylvania law may discourage takeovers.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may discourage or may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our Board of Directors. In particular, our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws:\n\u2022require shareholders to give us advance notice to nominate candidates for election to our Board of Directors or to make shareholder proposals at a shareholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022permit our Board of Directors to issue, without approval of our common shareholders unless otherwise required by law, preferred stock with such terms as our Board of Directors may determine;\n\u2022require the vote of the holders of at least 75% of our voting shares for shareholder amendments to our By-laws;\n\u2022in the case of a proposed business combination with a shareholder owning 10% or more of the voting shares of FNB, the vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting shares not owned by such shareholder is required to approve the business combination, unless it is approved by a majority of FNB\u2019s disinterested directors.\nUnder Pennsylvania law, only shareholders holding at least 25% of a corporation\u2019s outstanding stock may call a special meeting for any purpose. In addition, Pennsylvania law provides that in discharging their duties, including in the context of a takeover\nattempt, the board of directors, committees of the board and individual directors may consider a broad range of factors as they deem pertinent, which may include but is not limited to shareholders\u2019 interests, in considering the best interests of the corporation.\nThese provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws and of Pennsylvania law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though the holders of a majority of our stock may consider such proposals desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace members of our Board of Directors. Moreover, these provisions could diminish the opportunities for shareholders to participate in certain tender offers, including tender offers at prices above the then-current market price of our common stock, and may also inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts.\n5. Liquidity\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy will depend on our liquidity and ability to obtain funding for loan originations, working capital and other general purposes. Liquidity is needed to fund various obligations, including credit commitments to borrowers, mortgage and other loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of borrowings, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due, capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise, or pay regular dividends on our common stock because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Our preferred sources for funding are deposits and customer repurchase agreements, which are low cost and stable sources of funding for us. We compete with commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions, as well as non-depository competitors such as mutual funds, fintechs, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies, for deposits and customer repurchase agreements. If we are unable to attract and maintain sufficient levels of deposits and customer repurchase agreements to fund our loan growth and liquidity objectives, we may be subject to paying higher funding costs by raising interest rates that are paid on deposits and customer repurchase agreements or cause us to source funds from third-party providers which may be higher cost funding.\n6. Financial Industry\nThe financial soundness of other financial institutions may adversely affect FNB, FNBPA and other affiliates.\nFinancial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. FNB, FNBPA and other affiliates are exposed to many different industries and counterparties and they routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these types of transactions expose FNB, FNBPA and other affiliates to credit risk in the event of default of the counterparty or client. In addition, FNBPA and other affiliates\u2019 credit risks may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure that we are due.\nWe are subject to operational risk that could damage our reputation and our business. We engage in a variety of businesses in diverse markets and rely on systems, employees, service providers and counterparties to properly process a high volume of transactions.\nLike all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes in our systems, human error and external events. Operational risk also encompasses technology, compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. Many strategic initiatives, such as development of new products, product enhancements, use of technology, staffing reductions, changes in business processes and acquisitions of other financial services companies or their assets, could substantially increase operational risk. We are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect the changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business. We outsource certain data processing and online and mobile banking services to third-party providers. Those third-party providers could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Although we take steps to mitigate operational risks through a system of internal controls which we review on a regular basis and update as required, no system of controls - however well designed and maintained - is infallible, and, to the extent the risks arise from the operations of third-party vendors or customers, we have limited ability to control those risks. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risk could result in charges, increased\noperational costs, harm to our reputation, inability to secure insurance, civil litigation, regulatory intervention, including enforcement action and enhanced supervisory scrutiny, foregone business opportunities, the loss of customer business, especially if customers are discouraged from using our mobile bill pay, mobile banking and online banking services, or the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary information.\nThe banking and financial services industry continually encounters technological change, especially in the systems that are used to deliver products to, and execute transactions on behalf of, customers, and if we fail to continue to invest in technological improvements as they become appropriate or necessary, our ability to compete effectively could be severely impaired.\nThe banking and financial services industry continually undergoes technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including the potential utilization of blockchain technology to provide alternative high-speed payment systems. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better compete for and serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address customer needs by using secure technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our larger competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements, and we may not effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or do so as quickly as our competitors. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the banking and financial services industry could negatively affect our revenue and profitability.\n7. Cybersecurity\nAn interruption in or breach in security of our information systems, or other cybersecurity risks, could result in a loss of customer business, increased compliance and remediation costs, civil litigation or governmental regulatory action, and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAs part of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information in both paper and electronic form and rely heavily on communications and information systems for these functions. This information includes non-public, personally-identifiable information that is protected under applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, certain of these data processing functions are not handled by us directly, but are outsourced to third-party providers. We devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, including adoption of policies and procedures that involve our third-party providers to prevent, detect and deter cyber-related crimes intended to infiltrate our networks, capture sensitive client and customer information, deny service to customers, or harm electronic processing capabilities and be ready to respond, if necessary. Despite these efforts, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism and other physical security threats, computer viruses or compromises, ransomware attacks, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of our confidential business, employee or customer information, whether originating with us, our vendors or retail businesses, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of civil litigation and liability, require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties or undertaking of costly remediation efforts with respect to third parties affected by a security breach, disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe additional cost of our day-to-day cybersecurity monitoring and protection systems and controls includes the cost of hardware and software, third-party technology providers, consulting and forensic testing firms, insurance premium costs and legal fees, in addition to the incremental cost of our personnel who focus a substantial portion of their responsibilities on cybersecurity. We may also need to expend substantial resources to comply with the data security breach notification requirements adopted by banking regulators and the states, which have varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification and remediation requirements in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach.\nCybersecurity risks appear to be growing and, as a result, the cyber-resilience of banking organizations is of increased importance to federal and state banking agencies and other regulators. New or revised laws and regulations may significantly impact our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, the collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and employee information, and current or planned business activities. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nIn the last few years, there have been an increasing number of cyber incidents, including several well-publicized cyber-attacks that targeted other U.S. companies, including financial services companies much larger than us, such as the attack on the\ninformation technology company, SolarWinds. These cyber incidents have been initiated from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. Cyber-attacks involving large financial institutions, including denial of service attacks designed to disrupt external customer-facing services, nation-state cyber-attacks and ransomware attacks designed to deny organizations access to key internal resources or systems, as well as targeted social engineering and email attacks designed to allow unauthorized persons to obtain access to an institution\u2019s information systems and data, or that of its customers, are becoming more common and increasingly sophisticated. Further, threat actors are increasingly seeking to target vulnerabilities in software systems used by large numbers of banking organizations in order to conduct malicious cyber activities. These types of attacks have resulted in increased supply chain and third-party risk.\nAs technology advances, the ability to initiate transactions and access data has also become more widely distributed among mobile devices, personal computers, automated teller machines, remote deposit capture sites and similar access points, some of which are not controlled or secured by us. It is possible that we could have exposure to liability and suffer losses as a result of a security breach or cyber-attack that occurred through no fault of ours. Further, the probability of a successful cyber attack against us or one of our third-party services providers cannot be predicted. Although we maintain specific \u201ccyber\u201d insurance coverage, which would apply in the event of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. In addition, cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, several of which may not be covered under our cyber insurance coverage. As cyber threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to spend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective and preventative measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nCybersecurity risks for financial institutions also have evolved as a result of the use of new technologies, devices and delivery channels to transmit data and conduct financial transactions. The adoption of new products, services and delivery channels contribute to a more complex operating environment, which enhances operational risk and presents the potential for additional structural vulnerabilities. In addition, the ongoing and widespread remote work environment necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic has subjected institutions to additional cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks.\n8. Reputation\nOur key assets include our brand and reputation and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the market place.\nOur brand and our reputation are our key assets. Our ability to attract and retain banking, insurance, wealth management and corporate clients and employees is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our culture, level of service, security, trustworthiness, business practices and financial condition. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing customers and corporate clients and employees, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and employees and retain existing ones. Adverse developments with respect to the financial services industry or sociopolitical events and circumstances may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n9. Human and Vendor Resources\nOur day-to-day operations rely heavily on the proper functioning of products, information systems and services provided by third-party, external vendors.\nWe rely on certain external vendors to provide products, information systems and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. These third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third-party vendors in accordance with supervisory requirements and we oversee their provision of service to us in accordance with applicable enterprise risk management and third-party vendor risk management standards and in a manner consistent with the supervisory expectations of our regulators, we cannot control the actions of our third-party vendors entirely. Any complications caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to conform to our internal controls and risk management procedures, and failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to provide services. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create\nsignificant delay and expense. Problems caused by external vendors could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to continue to recruit and retain qualified banking professionals could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully and affect our profitability.\nOur continued success and future growth depends heavily on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled, diverse and motivated banking professionals. We compete against many institutions with greater financial resources both within our industry and in other industries to attract these qualified individuals. Our failure to recruit and retain adequate talent could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our business and profitability.\n10. Modeling Assumptions\nThere may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, developing strategic planning initiatives, capital stress testing and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and Balance Sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of such information. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to our stockholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator\u2019s perception that the quality of the models used to generate our relevant information is insufficient.\nOur asset valuations may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and this, along with market factors such as volatility in one or more markets or industries, could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when assets are measured and reported at fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Because the assets are carried at fair value, a decline in their value may cause us to incur losses even if the assets in question present minimal risk. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party resources, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relative inputs. Changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying these estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be more difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were historically in active markets with significant observable data that rapidly become illiquid due to market volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. In such cases, valuations in certain asset classes may require more subjectivity and management discretion; valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions in any particular market (e.g., credit, equity, fixed income) could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our Consolidated Financial Statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly.\nWe may be required to record future impairment charges if the declines in asset values are considered other-than-temporary. If the impairment charges are significant enough, they could affect the ability of FNBPA to pay dividends to FNB (which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders), and could also negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios and result in us not being classified as \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for regulatory purposes.\n11. Investment in Securities\nWe are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends to stockholders.\nWe are a holding company and conduct almost all of our operations through our subsidiaries. We do not have any significant assets other than cash and the stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders. Our right to participate in any distribution of earnings or assets of\nour subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of creditors of such subsidiaries. Under federal law, the amount of dividends that a national bank, such as FNBPA, may pay in a calendar year is dependent on the amount of our net income for the current year combined with our retained net income for the two preceding years. The OCC has the authority to prohibit FNBPA from paying dividends if it determines such payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Likewise, our state-based entities are subject to state laws governing dividend practices and payments.\nRegulatory authorities may restrict our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock.\nDividends on our common stock will be payable only if, when and as authorized and declared by our Board of Directors. In addition, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases. For example, our ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, is subject to the review and non-objection of our annual capital plan by the FRB. In certain circumstances, we will not be able to make a capital distribution unless the FRB has approved such distribution, including if the dividend could not be fully funded by our net income over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid), our prospective rate of earnings retention appears inconsistent with our capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition, or we will not be able to continue meeting minimum required capital ratios. As a bank holding company, we also are required to consult with the FRB before increasing dividends or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. Additionally, the FRB could prohibit or limit our payment of dividends if it determines that payment of the dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the future.\nWe have outstanding securities senior to common stock which could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have outstanding TPS and Series E preferred stock that are senior to the common stock and could adversely affect our ability to declare or pay dividends or distributions on our common stock. The terms of the TPS prohibit us from declaring or paying dividends or making distributions on our junior capital stock, including the common stock, or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on any junior capital stock, if: (1) an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the junior subordinated debentures underlying the TPS, (2) we are in default with respect to a guarantee payment under the guarantee of the related TPS or (3) we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments, but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. We also would be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock unless all full dividends for the latest dividend period have been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of the Series E preferred stock. If we experience a material deterioration in our financial condition, liquidity, capital, results of operations or risk profile, our regulators may not permit us to make future payments on our TPS or preferred stock, which would also prevent us from paying any dividends on our common stock.\n12. Recently Completed Howard Acquisition\nIntegrating our business with that of Howard may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger, which may adversely affect our business results and negatively affect the value of our common stock following the merger.\nThe success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses within our projected timeframe in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers.\nA number of factors could affect our ability to successfully integrate our businesses with the business of Howard. The business integration could be disruptive to our ongoing businesses, causing loss of momentum in one or more of such businesses or inconsistencies or changes in standards, practices, business models, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees. If we encounter significant difficulties in the integration process the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger in the timeframes projected could result in significantly increased costs and decreased revenues.\nThe merger may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe currently expect the merger to be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing (excluding one-time charges). This expectation, however, is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change. We may encounter additional transaction- and integration-related costs or other factors such as failing to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger or we may be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates or our ability to realize operational efficiencies.\nAny of these factors could cause a decrease in our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and contribute to a decrease in the price of our common stock.\nOur decisions regarding the credit risk associated with Howard Bank\u2019s loan portfolio could be incorrect and our credit mark may be inadequate, which may adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the combined company after the closing of the merger.\nBefore signing the merger agreement, we conducted extensive due diligence on a significant portion of the Howard Bank loan portfolio. However, our review did not encompass each and every loan in the Howard Bank loan portfolio. In accordance with customary industry practices, we evaluated the Howard Bank loan portfolio based on various factors including, among other things, historical loss experience, economic risks associated with each loan category, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, volume and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals, and general economic conditions, both local and national. In this process, our management made various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness and financial condition of the borrowers, the value of the real estate, which is obtained from independent appraisers, other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of the loans, the existence of any guarantees and indemnifications and the economic environment in which the borrowers operate. In addition, the effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on the Howard Bank loans were considered as part of our evaluation. If our assumptions and judgments turn out to be incorrect, including as a result of the fact that our due diligence review did not cover each individual loan, our estimated credit mark against the Howard Bank loan portfolio in total may be insufficient to cover actual loan losses after the merger is completed, and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the Howard Bank loan portfolio. Additionally, deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside our or Howard\u2019s control, may require an increase in the provision for credit losses. Material additions to the credit mark and/or ACL would materially decrease our net income and could result in heightened regulatory scrutiny and possibly supervisory action.", "PERMNO": 10629, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FNB"}
