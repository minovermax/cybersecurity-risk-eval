RISK FACTORS\nIndustry Risks\nHBB\u2019s business is sensitive to the strength of the North American consumer markets and weakness in these markets could adversely affect its business.\nThe strength of the economy in the U.S., and to a lesser degree in Canada and Mexico, has a significant impact on HBB\u2019s performance. Weakness in consumer confidence and poor financial performance by mass merchandisers, ecommerce retailers, warehouse clubs, department stores or any of HBB\u2019s other customers could result in reduced revenue and profitability. A general slowdown in the consumer sector could result in additional pricing and marketing support pressures on HBB.\nHBB is dependent on key customers and the loss of, or significant decline in business from, one or more of its key customers could materially reduce its revenue and profitability and its ability to sustain or grow its business.\nHBB relies on several key customers. Although HBB has long-established relationships with many customers, it does not have any long-term supply contracts with these customers, and purchases are generally made using individual purchase orders. A loss of or significant reduction in sales to any key customer could result in significant decreases in HBB\u2019s revenue and profitability and an inability to sustain or grow its business.\nHBB must receive a continuous flow of new orders from its large, high-volume retail customers; however, it may be unable to continually meet the needs of those customers. In addition, failure to obtain anticipated orders or delays or cancellations of orders or significant pressure to reduce prices from key customers could impair its ability to sustain or grow its business.\nAs a result of dependence on its key customers, HBB could experience a material adverse effect on its revenue and profitability if any of the following were to occur:\n\u2022the insolvency or bankruptcy of any key customer;\n\u2022a declining market in which customers materially reduce orders or demand lower prices; or\n\u2022a strike or work stoppage at a key customer facility, which could affect both its suppliers and customers.\nIf HBB were to lose, or experience a significant decline in business from any major customer, or if any major customers were to go bankrupt, HBB might be unable to find alternate distribution outlets.\nThe increasing concentration of HBB\u2019s branded small electric household and specialty housewares appliance sales among a few retailers and the trend toward private label brands could materially reduce revenue and profitability.\nWith the growing trend towards the concentration of HBB\u2019s branded small electric household and specialty housewares appliance sales among fewer retailers, HBB is increasingly dependent upon fewer customers whose bargaining strength is growing as a result of this concentration. HBB sells a substantial quantity of products to mass merchandisers, ecommerce retailers, national department stores, variety store chains, drug store chains, specialty home retailers and other retail outlets. As a result, these retailers generally have a large selection of small electric household and specialty housewares appliance suppliers from which to choose. In addition, certain of HBB\u2019s larger customers use their own private label brands on household appliances that compete directly with some of HBB\u2019s products. As the retailers in the small electric household appliance industry become more concentrated, competition for sales to these retailers may increase, which could materially reduce our revenue and profitability.\nIf HBB is unable to continue to enhance existing products, as well as develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and preferences and achieve market acceptance, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products, which could materially reduce revenue and profitability, which have historically benefited from sales of new products.\nHBB may not be able to compete as effectively with competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of customers, unless HBB can continue to enhance existing products and develop new innovative products for the markets in which HBB competes. Product development requires significant financial, technological, and other resources. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant research, planning, design, development, engineering, and testing at the technological and product process levels and HBB may not be able to timely develop and introduce product improvements or new products. Competitors\u2019 new products may beat HBB\u2019s products to market, be higher quality or more reliable, be more effective with more features, obtain better market acceptance, or render HBB\u2019s products obsolete. Any new products that HBB develops may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful revenue or profit relative to our expectations based on, among other things, commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs and development.\nHBB\u2019s inability to compete effectively with competitors in its industry could result in lost market share and decreased revenue.\nThe small electric household, specialty housewares appliances and commercial appliance industry does not have substantial entry barriers. As a result, HBB competes with many manufacturers and distributors of housewares products. Additional competitors may also enter this market and cause competition to intensify. For example, some of HBB\u2019s customers have expressed interest in sourcing, or expanding the extent of sourcing, small electric household and commercial appliances directly from manufacturers in Asia. We believe competition is based upon several factors, including product design and innovation, quality, price, product features, merchandising, promotion and warranty. If HBB fails to compete effectively with these manufacturers and distributors, it could lose market share and experience a decrease in revenue, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nHBB also competes with established companies, a number of which have substantially greater facilities, personnel, financial and other resources. In addition, HBB competes with its own retail customers, who use their own private label brands, and importers and foreign manufacturers of unbranded products. Some competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete. As a result of this competition, HBB could lose market share and revenue.\nChanges in consumer shopping trends and changes in distribution channels could result in lost market share and decreased revenue and profitability.\nTraditional brick-and-mortar retail channels have experienced low growth or declines in recent years, while the ecommerce channel has experienced significant growth. Consumer shopping preferences have shifted, and may continue to shift in the future, to distribution channels other than traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels. Success in the ecommerce channel requires providing products at the right price, products that earn strong ratings and reviews and meaningful engagement with online shoppers. HBB has invested in industry leading selling and marketing capabilities, while maintaining its presence in traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels. However, if we are not successful in utilizing ecommerce channels that consumers may prefer, we may experience a loss in market share and decreased revenue and profitability.\nHBB\u2019s business involves the potential for product recalls, which could affect HBB\u2019s revenue and profitability.\nAs a marketer and distributor of consumer products, HBB is subject to the Consumer Products Safety Act and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, which empower the CPSC to seek to exclude from the market those products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the CPSC could require HBB to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products, or HBB may voluntarily do so. Electrical appliances are subject to various mandatory and voluntary standards. Any repurchases or recalls of our products could be costly to us and could damage our reputation or the value of our brands. If HBB is required to remove, or HBB voluntarily removes our products from the market, our reputation or brands could be tarnished, and HBB might have large quantities of finished products that could not be sold. Furthermore, failure to timely notify the CPSC of a potential safety hazard can result in fines being assessed against HBB. Additionally, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states, as well as in other countries in which HBB sells our products, and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. HBB\u2019s results of operations are also susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality and safety of our products. In particular, product recalls may result in a decline in sales for a particular product.\nThe markets for HBB's products are highly seasonal and dependent on consumer spending, which could result in significant variations in revenue and profitability.\nSales of HBB products are related to consumer spending, including general economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment rates, business conditions, interest rates, levels of consumer confidence, energy prices, mortgage rates, the level of consumer debt and taxation. In addition, the retail market for small electric household and specialty housewares appliances is highly seasonal in nature. Accordingly, HBB generally recognizes a substantial portion of our revenue in the second half of the year as sales increase significantly with the fall holiday-selling season. Accordingly, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of past operating results of HBB are meaningful only when comparing equivalent time periods, if at all. Any economic downturn, decrease in consumer spending or shift in consumer spending away from small electric household and specialty housewares appliances may significantly reduce revenue and profitability.\nBusiness Risks\nOur results of operations have been adversely affected and, in the future, may be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including business shutdowns and limitations, travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings and shelter-in-place restrictions. This has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted financial markets and resulted in increased unemployment levels, all of which have negatively impacted various industries. Despite our efforts to manage through the current circumstances, the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus could:\n\u2022result in continued disruptions to our supply chain, especially with respect to freight availability and cost;\n\u2022continue to impact demand for our products;\n\u2022cause the Company to experience an increase in costs as a result of the Company\u2019s emergency measures, delayed payments from customers and increased risk of uncollectible accounts;\n\u2022limit the Company\u2019s access to further capital resources, if needed, and increase associated costs; and\n\u2022adversely impact economies and financial markets of our international operations resulting in an economic downturn that could affect the value of foreign currencies.\nMore recently, we have experienced the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic through increasing product and transportation costs.\nOver the preceding two years, the fluctuation in levels of the virus\u2019s effects on different portions of the global economy have continued to affect our business as well as other businesses. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global situation on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. The situation remains fluid and the potential for a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and stock price increases the longer the virus impacts activity levels in the United States and globally. For this reason, the Company cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position, liquidity and stock price. The extent of any impact will depend on the scope of any new virus mutations and outbreaks, the nature of government public health guidelines and the public\u2019s adherence to those guidelines, the rate of individuals becoming fully vaccinated, the public's adherence to guidelines to receive booster shots, the success of business and economic recovery as the pandemic recedes, unemployment levels, the extent to which new shutdowns may be needed, the impact of any further government economic relief on the U.S. economy, consumer confidence and demand for the Company's products. Any of these factors could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.\nHBB is subject to foreign currency exchange risk.\nHBB\u2019s products are supplied by third-party suppliers located primarily in China. HBB generally negotiates the purchases from its foreign suppliers in U.S. dollars. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies could result in certain non-U.S. manufacturers increasing the U.S. dollar prices for future product purchases.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our normal business operations, including risks in connection with our transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for purposes of our consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies generally will have a negative impact on our reported revenues and profitability, while depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and profitability.\nAny hedging activities HBB engages in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. HBB cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which HBB can mitigate these risks.\nIncreases in costs of products may materially reduce our profitability.\nFactors that are largely beyond HBB's control, such as inflation and commodity prices for the raw materials needed by suppliers of HBB\u2019s products, may affect the cost of products, and HBB may not be able to pass those costs on to its customers. As an example, HBB\u2019s products require a substantial amount of plastic. Because the primary resource used in plastic is petroleum, the cost and availability of plastic varies to a great extent with the price of petroleum. When the prices of petroleum, as well as steel, aluminum and copper, increase significantly, supplier price increases may materially reduce our profitability.\nFurther, our operations and performance depend on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. Russia\u2019s invasion and military attacks on Ukraine have triggered significant sanctions from U.S. and European leaders. These events are currently escalating and creating increasingly volatile global economic conditions. Resulting changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by Russia, its allies and other affected countries, including China, resulting in a \u201ctrade war.\u201d A trade war could result in increased costs for raw materials used in the manufacture of our products and could result in Russia and other foreign governments imposing tariffs on products that we import or export, or otherwise limiting our ability to source materials or sell our products abroad. These increased costs would have a negative effect on our financial condition and profitability.\nTo the extent that HBB relies on newly acquired businesses or new product lines to expand its business, these acquisitions or new product lines may not contribute positively to HBB\u2019s earnings because anticipated sales volumes and synergies may not materialize, cost savings may be less than expected or acquired businesses may carry unexpected liabilities.\nHBB may acquire partial or full ownership in businesses or may acquire rights to market and distribute particular products or lines of products. The acquisition of a business or of the rights to market specific products or use specific product names may involve a financial commitment by HBB, either in the form of cash or stock consideration. HBB may not be able to acquire businesses and develop products that will contribute positively to HBB\u2019s earnings. Anticipated synergies may not materialize, cost savings may be less than expected, sales of products may not meet expectations or acquired businesses may carry unexpected liabilities.\nHBB depends on third-party suppliers for all of our products, which subjects the Company to risks, including unanticipated increases in expenses, decreases in revenue and disruptions in the supply chain.\nHBB is dependent on third-party suppliers for the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Our ability to select reliable suppliers that provide timely deliveries of quality products will impact our success in meeting customer demand. Any supplier's inability to timely deliver products that meet desired specifications or any unanticipated changes in suppliers could be disruptive and costly. Any significant failure by HBB to obtain quality products, in sufficient quantities, on a timely basis, and at an affordable cost or any significant delays or interruptions of supply would have a material adverse effect on revenue and profitability. As certain suppliers are primarily based in China, international operations are subject to additional risks including, among others:\n\u2022currency fluctuations;\n\u2022labor unrest;\n\u2022potential political, economic and social instability, including the repercussions of the conflict in Ukraine;\n\u2022restrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u2022import and export duties and quotas;\n\u2022changes in domestic and international customs and tariffs, including embargoes and customs restrictions;\n\u2022uncertainties involving the costs to transport products;\n\u2022long distance shipping routes dependent upon a small group of shipping and rail carriers and import facilities;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory environments;\n\u2022regulatory issues involved in dealing with foreign suppliers and in exporting and importing products;\n\u2022protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022difficulty in complying with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022difficulty in obtaining distribution and administrative support;\n\u2022natural or human induced disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures, and medical epidemics or pandemics, including potential consequences from the coronavirus; and\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including significant changes in tax law.\nThe foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain or increase the supply of products, which may result in material increases in expenses and decreases in revenue and profitability.\nOur financial results may be negatively impacted by transportation constraints on shipping capabilities.\nOur ability to meet customers\u2019 demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain the timely and adequate shipment of our products. Certain transportation industry vendors may experience capacity constraints due to increases in volume. For example, 2021 saw continued congestion in several areas of the supply chain, including the supply chain from China to our distribution facility as well as certain customers' ability to send in equipment to pick up or receive goods due to congestion at their facilities, impacted our ability to receive and ship inventory in a timely manner and resulted in increased freight charges. If our transportation industry vendors become capacity constrained, then we may have to identify new vendors or explore alternative order fulfillment methods to ensure we have sufficient shipping capabilities. We have experienced and may continue to experience significant delays in shipping our products to customers and incur additional costs to establish alternative shipping sources if existing vendors are unable to sufficiently handle our shipping volume. We cannot predict if we will be able to obtain alternative shipping sources within the time frames that we require and at a comparable cost.\nFurther, Russia\u2019s invasion and military attacks on Ukraine, including indirect impacts as a result of sanctions and economic disruption, may cause further constraints on our supply chain. These limitations could impact our ability to supply our products to our customers. If we encounter delays or difficulties that disrupt our ability to supply our products, we may not be able to satisfy customer demand or we may experience a reduction in product stock, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could significantly reduce its consolidated profitability.\nThe Company is highly dependent on the skills, experience and services of its and its subsidiaries\u2019 key personnel and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated business, operating results and financial condition. Employment and retention of qualified personnel is important to the successful conduct of our business. Therefore, the Company's success also depends upon its ability to recruit, hire, train and retain current and additional skilled and experienced management personnel. The Company's inability to hire and retain personnel with the requisite skills could impair its ability to manage and operate its consolidated business effectively and could significantly reduce its consolidated profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s business could suffer if information technology systems are disrupted, cease to operate effectively or become subject to a security breach.\nThe Company relies heavily on information technology systems to operate websites; record and process transactions; respond to customer inquiries; manage inventory; purchase, sell and ship merchandise on a timely basis; and maintain cost-efficient operations. Given the significant number of transactions that are completed annually, it is vital to maintain constant operation of computer hardware and software systems and maintain cybersecurity. In addition, we collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data.\nCyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include computer viruses or other malicious codes, attacks to gain unauthorized access to data, and other security breaches that could lead to the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information, or a disruption of our critical systems. The Audit Review Committee of the Company is regularly briefed on cybersecurity matters, however despite our security efforts, if unauthorized access does occur, we could become the subject of regulatory action or litigation from our customers, employees, suppliers, and shareholders, which could damage our reputation, require significant expenditures of capital, and cause us to lose business and revenue. Additionally, unauthorized access could also cause interruptions in our operations and might require us to spend significant management time and other resources investigating the event and dealing with local and federal law enforcement. While we have not experienced any material impacts from a cyber-attack, any one or more future cyber-attacks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable from time to time to damage and other technical malfunctions. If our systems are damaged, or fail to function properly, we may have to make monetary investments to repair or replace the systems and could endure delays in operations. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems, including our failure to successfully upgrade systems, could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed. Such a loss or delay could reduce demand and cause our sales and/or profitability to decline.\nFailure to maintain data privacy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to certain laws, rules and regulations enacted to protect businesses and personal data (\u201cPrivacy Laws\u201d), which may include the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), as well as industry self-regulatory codes that create new compliance obligations. The administration, enforcement and regulation of Privacy Laws are quickly evolving and subject to changes in interpretation. Future changes in Privacy Laws may require the Company to incur additional and unexpected expenses and may subject the Company to additional compliance risk. Any failure to comply with Privacy Laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nHBB may be subject to risks relating to increasing cash requirements of certain employee benefits plans, which may affect its financial position.\nBecause HBB\u2019s defined benefit pension plans are frozen and no longer provide for the accrual of future benefits, the expenses recorded for, and cash contributions required to be made to its defined benefit pension plans are dependent on, changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which, in turn, are dependent on actual investment returns. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the value of plan assets or investment losses on plan assets may require HBB to increase the cash contributed to its defined benefit pension plans which may affect its financial position.\nThe financing arrangement of HBB contains various restrictions that could limit operating flexibility.\nHBB\u2019s credit facility contains covenants and other restrictions that, among other things, require HBB to satisfy certain financial tests, maintain certain financial ratios and restrict HBB\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness. The restrictions and covenants in HBB\u2019s credit facility, and other future financing arrangements may limit HBB\u2019s ability to respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings HBB may incur.\nRegulatory Risks\nHBB may become subject to claims under foreign laws and regulations, which may be expensive, time-consuming and distracting.\nBecause HBB has employees, property and business operations outside of the U.S., HBB is subject to the laws and the court systems of many jurisdictions. HBB may become subject to claims outside the U.S. for violations or alleged violations of laws with respect to the current or future foreign operations of HBB. In addition, these laws may be changed or new laws may be enacted in the future. International litigation is often expensive, time-consuming and distracting. As a result, any of these risks could significantly reduce HBB\u2019s profitability and its ability to operate its businesses effectively.\nHBB\u2019s obligations relating to environmental matters may exceed our expectations.\nHBB is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the\nmanagement and disposal of hazardous substances. HBB is investigating or remediating historical contamination at some current and former sites related to HBB\u2019s prior manufacturing operations or the operations of businesses HBB acquired. The costs of investigating and remediating historical contamination may increase based on the findings of investigations and the effectiveness of remediation methods. In addition, the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant cleanup costs that could have a material adverse effect on HBB\u2019s financial conditions and results of operations. Future changes to environmental laws could require HBB to incur significant additional expense.\nHBB could, under some circumstances, also be held financially liable for or suffer other adverse effects due to environmental violations or contamination caused by prior owners of businesses HBB has acquired. In certain circumstances, HBB\u2019s financial liability for cleanup costs takes into account agreements with an unrelated third party. HBB\u2019s liability for these costs could increase if the unrelated third party does not, or cannot, perform its obligations under those agreements. In addition, under some of the agreements through which HBB has sold real estate, HBB has retained responsibility for certain contingent environmental liabilities arising from pre-closing operations. These liabilities may not arise, if at all, until years after HBB sold these operations and could require us to incur significant additional expenses, which could materially adversely affect HBB\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to litigation risk which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nFrom time to time we are subject to claims involving product liability, infringement of intellectual property and patent rights of third parties and other matters. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive, and may require the Company to incur substantial costs and divert the resources of management. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the period in which the ruling occurs, or in future periods.\nHBB\u2019s business subjects it to product liability claims, which could affect the reputation, revenue and profitability of HBB.\nHBB faces exposure to product liability claims if one of our products is alleged to have caused property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects up to a defined self-insured loss limit per claim and maintains product liability insurance for claims above this self-insured level. If a product liability claim is brought against HBB, our revenue and profitability could be affected adversely as a result of negative publicity related to the claim, costs associated with any replacement of the product or expenses related to defending these claims. This could be true even if the claims themselves are ultimately settled for immaterial amounts. In addition, HBB may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on terms acceptable to HBB in the future. If the number of product liability claims HBB experiences exceeds historical amounts, if HBB is unable to maintain product liability insurance or if HBB\u2019s product liability claims exceed the amount of our insurance coverage, HBB\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be affected adversely.\nGovernment regulations could impose costly requirements on HBB.\nThe SEC adopted conflict mineral rules under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act on August 22, 2012. The rules require disclosure of the use of certain minerals, commonly known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which are mined from the DRC and adjoining countries. Since HBB\u2019s supply chain is complex, ultimately it may not be able to designate all products as \u201cDRC conflict free\u201d which may adversely affect its reputation with certain customers. In such event, HBB may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require products purchased from HBB to be \u201cDRC conflict free\u201d. If HBB is not able to meet such requirements, customers may choose not to purchase HBB products, which could adversely affect sales and the value of portions of HBB\u2019s inventory.\nHBB is subject in the ordinary course of its business, in the U.S. and elsewhere, to many statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations that, if violated by HBB or its affiliates, partners or vendors, could have a material adverse effect on HBB\u2019s business. HBB is required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-kickback laws adopted in many of the countries in which HBB does business which prohibit HBB from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and also require maintenance of adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect transactions. Under the FCPA, companies operating in the U.S. may be held liable for actions taken by their strategic or local partners or representatives. If HBB does not properly implement and maintain practices and controls with respect to compliance with applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws, or if HBB fails to enforce those practices and controls properly, HBB may be held responsible for their actions and may become subject to regulatory sanctions, including administrative costs related to governmental and internal investigations, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions and restrictions on HBB\u2019s business and capital raising activities, any of which could materially and adversely affect HBB\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nU.S. government trade actions could have a material adverse effect on Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company\u2019s subsidiaries, financial position, and results of operation.\nThe U.S. government has taken a number of trade actions that impact or could impact our operations, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States. In addition, several governments, including the European Union, China and India, have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the United States. As the majority of our products are imported into the United States from China, many of our product lines are subject to the tariffs imposed under Section 301 of U.S. trade law that have been applied to separate lists of Chinese goods imported into the United States. The Section 301 tariffs on goods covered by lists 1, 2, 3 and 4a affect approximately 25% of total HBB purchases on an annualized basis. On December 13, 2019, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced a \u201cPhase One\u201d agreement with China pursuant to which the U.S. government agreed to suspend the 15% tariffs on List 4b products. On January 15, 2020, USTR issued a Federal Register notice reducing the rate of Section 301 tariffs on List 4a products to 7.5%, effective February 14, 2020. A number of lawsuits and other legal challenges with respect to the Section 301 tariff actions have been filed and remain pending, which could result in changes to the tariffs. To date, the Biden Administration has effectively maintained and has continued to defend and to enforce these particular trade actions. We are continually evaluating the impact of the current and any possible new tariffs on our supply chain, costs, sales and profitability and are considering strategies to mitigate such impact, including reviewing sourcing options, filing requests for exclusion from the tariffs for certain product lines and working with our suppliers and customers. We can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful. Given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of these trade actions by the U.S. government or other countries, as well as the potential for additional trade actions, the impact on our operations and results remains uncertain.\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and as a result of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, the reduced disclosures may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with those of another public company that is neither (i) an emerging growth company nor (ii) an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period, difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe will lose our status as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2022, the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our spin-off from NACCO Industries, Inc.\nRegistered Securities Risk\nThe amount and frequency of dividend payments made on Hamilton Beach Holding\u2019s common stock could change.\nThe Company's Board has the power to determine the amount and frequency of the payment of dividends. Decisions regarding whether or not to pay dividends and the amount of any dividends are based on earnings, capital, and future expense requirements, financial conditions, contractual limitations and other factors our Board may consider.\nCertain members of the Company's extended founding family own a substantial amount of Class A Common and Class B Common, and if they were to act in concert, could control the outcome of director elections and other stockholder votes on significant actions.\nHamilton Beach Holding has two classes of common stock: Class A Common and Class B Common. Holders of Class A Common will be entitled to cast one vote per share and, as of December 31, 2021, accounted for approximately 19.84% of the voting power of Hamilton Beach Holding. Holders of Class B Common are entitled to cast ten votes per share and, as of December 31, 2021, accounted for the remaining voting power of Hamilton Beach Holding. As of December 31, 2021, certain members of the Company's extended founding family held approximately 33.75% of Class A Common and 81.65% of Class B Common. On the basis of this common stock ownership, certain members of the Company's extended founding family could exercise 72.14% of the Company's total voting power. Although there is no voting agreement among such family members, in writing or otherwise, if they were to act in concert, they would exert significant control over the outcome of director elections and other stockholder votes on significant actions, such as certain amendments to the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and sale of the Company or substantially all of its assets. Because such family members could prevent other stockholders from exercising significant influence over significant corporate actions, the Company may be a less attractive takeover target, which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock.", "PERMNO": 16920, "SIC": 3630, "TIC": "HBB"}
