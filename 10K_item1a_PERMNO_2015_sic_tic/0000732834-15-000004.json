If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe are subject to certain risks and hazards due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. The risks discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nA substantial or extended decline in crude oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and our ability to meet our capital expenditure needs and financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital, capital budget and future rate of growth. Crude oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, as evidenced by the significant decrease in crude oil prices in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, and which continued into early 2015. Historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile; for example, the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices ranged from $53.45 to $107.95 per barrel and $2.74 to $8.15 per MMBtu, respectively, during 2014. Crude oil and natural gas prices are likely to remain volatile in 2015.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, following a decrease in crude oil prices and related increase in the fair value of our derivative assets, substantially all of our outstanding crude oil derivative contracts for periods subsequent to December 31, 2014 were settled prior to the expiration of their contractual maturities, resulting in the receipt of cash proceeds totaling approximately $433 million. Consequently, our crude oil production and sales for 2015 and beyond are currently unhedged and directly exposed to continued volatility in crude oil market prices, whether favorable or unfavorable.\nThe prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide, domestic and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing nations;\n\u2022\nthe level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign crude oil;\n\u2022\nthe potential export of crude oil or liquefied natural gas from the United States;\n\u2022\nmilitary and political conditions in or affecting other crude oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries;\n\u2022\nthe nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nthe level of national and global crude oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of national and global crude oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals;\n\u2022\nthe availability, proximity and capacity of transportation, processing, storage and refining facilities;\n\u2022\nchanges in supply, demand, and refinery capacity for various grades of crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability of refineries in the United States to accommodate increasing domestic supplies of light sweet crude oil;\n\u2022\nthe cost of transporting, processing, and marketing crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe effect of worldwide energy conservation and environmental protection efforts; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels or other energy sources.\nSustained declines in crude oil and natural gas prices may: (i) reduce our cash flows available for capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness and other corporate purposes; (ii) limit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital; and (iii) reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas we can economically produce.\nSubstantial, extended decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration, development and exploitation projects or may render such projects uneconomic. This may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and may lead to a downgrade or other negative rating action with respect to our credit rating. A downgrade of our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets, increase our costs under our credit facility, and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans. As a result, a substantial or extended decline in crude oil or natural gas prices would materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments.\nA substantial portion of our producing properties are located in the North region, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in this geographic area.\nOur operations are geographically concentrated in the North region, with that region comprising approximately 74% of our crude oil and natural gas production and approximately 83% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, as of December 31, 2014 approximately 69% of our estimated proved reserves were located in the North region. Our principal producing properties in the North region are located in the Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana.\nBecause of this geographic concentration, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately exposed to regional factors relative to our competitors that have more geographically dispersed operations. These factors include, among others: (i) the prices of crude oil and natural gas produced from wells in the region and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline and rail transportation capacity constraints; (ii) the availability of rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies, and labor; (iii) the availability of processing and refining facilities; and (iv) infrastructure capacity. In addition, our operations in the North region may be adversely affected by severe weather events such as floods and blizzards, which can intensify competition for the items described above during months when drilling is possible and may result in periodic shortages. The concentration of our operations in the North region also increases our exposure to changes in local laws and regulations, certain lease stipulations designed to protect wildlife, and unexpected events that may occur in the region such as natural disasters, industrial accidents or labor difficulties. Any one of these events has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs and prevent development of lease inventory before expiration. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVolatility in the financial markets or in global economic factors could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nUnited States and global economies may experience periods of turmoil and volatility from time to time, which may be characterized by diminished liquidity and credit availability, inability to access capital markets, high unemployment, unstable consumer confidence and diminished consumer spending. In recent periods, there has been significant downward pressure on oil prices, and a continuation of that trend could continue or exacerbate that pressure. This would negatively impact our revenues, margins, profitability, operating cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. Such weakness or uncertainty could also cause our natural gas hedging arrangements or future crude oil hedges, if any, to become economically ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection. Furthermore, our ability to collect receivables may be adversely impacted.\nHistorically, we have used cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from capital market transactions to fund capital expenditures. Volatility in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may result in our inability to obtain needed capital on acceptable terms or at all and may increase our cost of financing. We have a credit facility with lender commitments totaling $2.5 billion, which may be increased up to a total of $4.0 billion upon agreement with participating lenders. In the future, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our credit facility if our lenders are unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations or increase their commitments as required under the credit facility. Due to these and other factors, we cannot be certain that funding, if needed, will be available to the extent required or on terms we find acceptable. If we are unable to access funding when needed on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fully implement our business plans, fund our capital program and commitments, complete new property acquisitions to replace reserves, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures, or refinance debt obligations as they come due. Should any of the above risks occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur exploration, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on acceptable terms, which could lead to a decline in our crude oil and natural gas reserves, production and revenues. In addition, funding our capital expenditures with additional debt will increase our leverage and doing so with equity securities may result in dilution that reduces the value of your stock.\nThe crude oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the exploration, development, exploitation, production and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas reserves. In 2014, we invested approximately $5.02 billion in our capital program, inclusive of property acquisitions. We have budgeted $2.70 billion for capital expenditures in 2015 (excluding acquisitions which are not budgeted) of which $2.48 billion is allocated for drilling, capital workovers and facilities. Our 2015 capital expenditures are substantially lower than such expenditures in 2014 as a result of lower commodity prices. We may find that additional reductions are prudent depending on market conditions.\nHistorically, our capital expenditures have been financed with cash generated by operations, borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities. The actual amount and timing of future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among others, changes in commodity prices, available cash flows, lack of access to capital, unbudgeted acquisitions, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, the availability of transportation capacity, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments.\nOur cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe amount of our proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe volume of crude oil and natural gas we are able to produce and sell from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which crude oil and natural gas are sold;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; and\n\u2022\nthe ability and willingness of our lenders to extend credit or of participants in the capital markets to invest in our senior notes or equity securities.\nIf revenues or our ability to borrow decrease significantly, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at planned levels. If cash generated by operations or cash available under our credit facility is not sufficient to meet capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of operations relating to development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a decline in our crude oil and natural gas reserves and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our ability to achieve our growth plans.\nWe intend to finance future capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility; however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets. The issuance of additional debt will require a portion of our cash flows from operations to be used for the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock.\nDrilling for and producing crude oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploration, development and production activities. Our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable crude oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data, and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells may be uncertain before drilling commences.\nRisks we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, failing to place our well bore in the desired target producing zone; not staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation; failing to run our casing the entire length of the well bore; and not being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, not being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages; failing to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations; and not successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nFurther, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel scheduled drilling projects, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nabnormal pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment or qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining components used in fracture stimulation processes such as water and proppants;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, fires, explosions, equipment failures or accidents, including ruptures of pipelines or train derailments;\n\u2022\npolitical events, public protests, civil disturbances, terrorist acts or cyber attacks;\n\u2022\ndecreases in crude oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing with acceptable terms;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, hydraulic fracturing fluids, toxic gas or other pollutants into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\n\u2022\nspillage or mishandling of crude oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, hydraulic fracturing fluids, toxic gas or other pollutants by us or by third party service providers;\n\u2022\nlimitations in infrastructure, including transportation, processing and refining capacity, or markets for crude oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including permitting.\nAdditionally, severe weather conditions and natural disasters such as flooding, tornadoes, blizzards and ice storms affecting the areas in which we operate, including our corporate headquarters, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. The consequences of such events may include the evacuation of personnel, damage to drilling rigs or pipeline and rail transportation facilities, an inability to access well sites, destruction of information and communication systems, and the disruption of administrative and management processes, any of which could hinder our ability to conduct normal operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. The Company's current estimates of reserves could change, potentially in material amounts, in the future, in particular due to the recent significant decline in commodity prices.\nThe process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise. It requires interpretation of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions, production rates, drilling and operating expenses, and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracy in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect our estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations-Proved Reserves for information about our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves, PV-10, and Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows as of December 31, 2014.\nIn order to prepare reserve estimates, we must project production rates and the amount and timing of development expenditures. Our booked proved undeveloped reserves must be developed within five years from the date of initial booking under SEC reserve rules. Changes in the timing of development plans that impact our ability to develop such reserves in the required time frame could result in fluctuations in reserves between periods as reserves booked in one period may need to be removed in a subsequent period.\nWe must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data in preparing reserve estimates. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary with the uncertainty of decline curves and the ability to model heterogeneity of the porosity, permeability and pressure relationships in unconventional resources. The process also requires economic assumptions, based on historical data but projected into the future, about matters such as crude oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.\nThe prices used in calculating our estimated proved reserves are, in accordance with SEC requirements, calculated by determining the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the preceding 12 months. For the 12-months ended December 31, 2014, average prices used to calculate our estimated proved reserves were $94.99 per Bbl for crude oil and $4.35 per MMBtu for natural gas ($84.54 per Bbl for crude oil and $6.06 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials). Commodity prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 and if such prices\ndo not increase significantly, our future calculations of estimated proved reserves will be based on lower commodity prices which could result in our having to remove non-economic reserves from our proved reserves in future periods. Holding all other factors constant, if commodity prices used in our year-end reserve estimates were decreased by $40.00 per Bbl for crude oil and $1.00 per Mcf for natural gas, thereby approximating the pricing environment existing in February 2015, our proved reserves at December 31, 2014 could decrease by approximately 10%.\nActual future production, crude oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves will vary and could vary significantly from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the value of our assets. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves, potentially in material amounts, to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing crude oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves and, in particular, may be reduced due to the recent significant decline in commodity prices.\nYou should not assume the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC rules, we base the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months. Actual future prices may be materially higher or lower than the SEC pricing used in the calculations. Actual future net revenues from crude oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nthe actual prices we receive for sales of crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe actual cost and timing of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of actual production; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net revenues may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our reserves or the crude oil and natural gas industry in general.\nAt December 31, 2014, the PV-10 value of our proved reserves totaled approximately $22.8 billion. The average prices used to estimate our proved reserves and PV-10 at December 31, 2014, as calculated in accordance with SEC rules, were $94.99 per Bbl for crude oil and $4.35 per MMBtu for natural gas ($84.54 per Bbl for crude oil and $6.06 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials). Actual future prices may materially differ from those used in our year-end estimates. If crude oil prices decline by $10.00 per barrel from those used in our year-end estimates, our PV-10 as of December 31, 2014 could decrease approximately $3.2 billion, or 14%. If natural gas prices decline by $1.00 per Mcf from those used in our year-end estimates, our PV-10 as of December 31, 2014 could decrease approximately $1.7 billion, or 8%.\nCommodity prices have decreased significantly in recent months. Holding all other factors constant, if commodity prices used in our year-end reserve estimates were decreased by $40.00 per Bbl for crude oil and $1.00 per Mcf for natural gas, thereby approximating the pricing environment existing in February 2015, our PV-10 at December 31, 2014 could decrease by approximately $13.8 billion, or 61%.\nWe may be required to write down the carrying values of our crude oil and natural gas properties if crude oil prices remain at their currently low levels or decline further.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying values of our crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors, prices, and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying values of our crude oil and natural gas properties. A write-down results in a non-cash charge to earnings. We have incurred impairment charges in the past and may incur additional impairment charges in the future, particularly if crude oil prices remain at their currently low levels or decline further, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nUnless we replace our crude oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nUnless we conduct successful exploration, development and exploitation activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing crude oil and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future crude oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flows and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis.\nIn the regions in which we operate, there have historically been shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel or oilfield services, including key components used in fracture stimulation processes such as water and proppants, as well as high costs associated with these critical components of our operations. Such shortages or costs could delay the execution of our drilling plans or cause us to incur significant expenditures not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our crude oil and natural gas operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and under-insured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing crude oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, hydraulic fracturing fluids, toxic gas or other pollutants into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u2022\nloss of product or property damage occurring as a result of transfer to a rail car or train derailments;\n\u2022\npersonal injuries and death;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions and natural disasters; and\n\u2022\nspillage or mishandling of crude oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, hydraulic fracturing fluids, toxic gas or other pollutants by us or by third party service providers.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u2022\nrepair and remediation costs.\nWe may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks we face are generally not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProspects we decide to drill may not yield crude oil or natural gas in economically producible quantities.\nProspects we decide to drill that do not yield crude oil or natural gas in economically producible quantities may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In this report, we describe some of our current prospects and plans to explore and develop those prospects. Our prospects are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect which is ready to drill to a prospect that will require substantial additional seismic data processing and interpretation. It is not possible to predict with certainty in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield crude oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or be economically producible. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether crude oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether crude oil or natural gas will be present in economically producible quantities. We cannot assure you the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including crude oil and natural gas prices, the availability of capital, costs, drilling results, regulatory approvals, available transportation capacity, and other factors. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling in these projects. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations in sufficient quantities to achieve an economic return. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire. Currently low crude oil prices, reduced capital spending and numerous other factors, many of which are beyond our control, could result in our failure to establish production on undeveloped acreage, and, if we are not able to renew leases before they expire, any proved undeveloped reserves associated with such leases will be removed from our proved reserves. The combined net acreage expiring in the next three years represents 66% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2014. At that date, we had leases representing 410,481 net acres expiring in 2015, 345,612 net acres expiring in 2016, and 271,597 net acres expiring in 2017. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Our proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 63% of our total estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped and may not be ultimately developed or produced. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Our reserve estimates assume we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions, however, may not prove to be accurate. Our reserve report at December 31, 2014 includes estimates of total future development costs over the next five years associated with our proved undeveloped reserves of approximately $12.2 billion. We cannot be certain the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled, or that the results of such development will be as estimated. If we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC\u2019s reserve rules, because proved undeveloped reserves may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any proved undeveloped reserves not developed within this five-year time frame. A removal of such reserves could adversely affect our operations. In 2014, 105 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves were removed from our year-end reserve estimates due to various factors, including removals associated with drilling locations no longer scheduled to be developed within five years from the date of initial booking.\nOur business depends on crude oil and natural gas transportation, processing and refining facilities, most of which are owned by third parties, and on the availability of rail transportation.\nThe marketability of our crude oil and natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline and rail systems and processing and refining facilities owned by third parties. The inadequacy or unavailability of capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay, or discontinuance of, development plans for properties. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our product, changes in these business relationships or failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could adversely affect our operations. If our\nproduction becomes shut-in for any of these or other reasons, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until other arrangements were made to deliver the products to market.\nThe disruption of transportation, processing or refining facilities due to labor disputes, maintenance, civil disturbances, public protests, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, adverse weather, natural disasters, changes in tax and energy policies, federal and state regulatory developments, changes in supply and demand, equipment failures or accidents, including pipeline ruptures or train derailments, and general economic conditions could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products or achieve the most favorable prices for our crude oil and natural gas production. We have no control over when or if access to such facilities would be restored or what prices would be charged. A significant shut-in of production in connection with any of the aforementioned items could materially affect our cash flows, and if a substantial portion of the impacted production is hedged at lower than market prices, those financial hedges would have to be paid from borrowings absent sufficient cash flows.\nWe transport a portion of the operated crude oil production from our North region to market centers using rail transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties, with approximately 36% of such production being shipped by rail in December 2014. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry-Regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids for a discussion of regulations that could potentially impact the transportation of crude oil by rail. The introduction of regulations, including voluntary measures adopted by the railroad industry, that result in new requirements addressing the type, design, specifications or construction of rail cars used to transport crude oil could result in severe transportation capacity constraints during the period in which new rail cars are retrofitted or constructed to meet new specifications. We do not currently own or operate rail transportation facilities or rail cars; however, the adoption of any regulations that impact the testing or rail transportation of crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at market centers throughout the United States, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on the availability of water and the ability to dispose of water. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain or dispose of water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWith current technology, water is an essential component of drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle water after use, could adversely impact our operations. In some cases, water may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling sites, resulting in increased costs. Moreover, the introduction of new environmental initiatives and regulations related to water acquisition or waste water disposal, including produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons, could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize hydraulic fracturing or waste water injection control wells.\nIn addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for earthquakes to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. New rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and increasing the cost of disposal in others. We operate injection wells and utilize injection wells owned by third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage, and use of water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal of water may increase our operating costs or may cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have been an early entrant into new or emerging plays. As a result, our drilling results in these areas are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nWhile our costs to acquire undeveloped acreage in new or emerging plays have generally been less than those of later entrants into a developing play, our drilling results in these areas are more uncertain than drilling results in developed and producing areas. Since new or emerging plays have limited or no production history, we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. As a result, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful. For instance, one of our prospects in Texas in the early stages of exploration and development has not yielded sufficient reserves and production to achieve a satisfactory economic return, which resulted in $58 million of proved property impairments and $92 million of unproved property impairments being recognized for the prospect in 2014.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur crude oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing environmental protection, the occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the protection of certain plant and animal species. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us. In order to conduct operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. Environmental regulations may restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenues.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including investigatory actions, the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, or the issuance of orders or judgments limiting or enjoining future operations. Strict liability or joint and several liability may be imposed under certain laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions. For instance, an accidental release from one of our wells could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations.\nMoreover, our costs of compliance with existing laws could be substantial and may increase or unforeseen liabilities could be imposed if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. If we are not able to recover the increased costs through insurance or increased revenues, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nClimate change legislation or regulations governing the emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduce demand for the crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that will be established on a case-by-case basis. We currently do not have any facilities that are required to adhere to the PSD or Title V permit requirements. EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.\nIn addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. More recently, in January 2015, the Obama Administration announced that the EPA is expected to propose in the summer of 2015 and finalize in 2016 new regulations that will set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities as part of the Administration\u2019s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45% from 2012 levels by 2025.\nWhile Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved. These reductions may cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time.\nThe adoption and implementation of regulations that require reporting of greenhouse gases or otherwise limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions or install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for our products by stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on combustion of fossil fuels that serve as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, it should be noted some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods or other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur as a result of climate change or otherwise, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays and inability to book future reserves.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of crude oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the high-pressure injection of water, sand and additives into rock formations to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production. Recently there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies and increase the potential for earthquakes. As a result, several federal and state agencies are considering legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.\nAt the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014. In addition, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. To date, no other action has been taken. Further, the EPA has announced its intention to propose regulations under the CWA sometime in 2015 governing wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations. The EPA is also conducting a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing on water resources and a draft final report is anticipated sometime in 2015 for peer review and public comment. The results of this study or similar governmental reviews could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. Further, the Bureau of Land Management issued a revised proposed rule in May 2013 that would require public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations, and impose other operational requirements for all hydraulic fracturing operations on federal lands, including Native American trust lands. As of December 31, 2014, we held approximately 209,800 net undeveloped acres on federal land, representing approximately 14% of our total net undeveloped acres.\nAt the state level, several states, including states in which we operate, have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In certain areas of the United States, new drilling permits for hydraulic fracturing have been put on hold pending development of additional standards.\nThe adoption of any future federal, state or local law or implementing regulation imposing permitting or reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process, or the discovery of groundwater contamination or other adverse environmental effects directly connected to hydraulic fracturing, could make it more difficult and more expensive to complete crude oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations and increase our costs of compliance and doing business, as well as delay, prevent or prohibit the development of natural resources from unconventional formations. In the event regulations are adopted that prohibit or significantly limit the use of hydraulic fracturing in states in which we operate, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to economically find and develop crude oil and natural gas reserves in our strategic plays. The inability to achieve a satisfactory economic return could cause us to curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans. This would have a material adverse effect on our business and would impair our ability to implement our growth plans.\nProposed legislation and regulations under consideration could increase our operating costs, reduce our liquidity, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business.\nChanges to existing laws or regulations, new laws or regulations, or changes in interpretations of laws and regulations may unfavorably impact us or the infrastructure used for transporting our products. Similarly, changes in regulatory policies and priorities could result in the imposition of new obligations upon us, such as increased reporting or audits. Any of these requirements could result in increased operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If such legislation, regulations or other requirements are adopted, they could result in, among other items, additional limitations and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing of wells, changes to the calculation of royalty payments, new safety requirements such as those involving rail transportation, and additional regulation of private energy commodity derivative and hedging activities. These and other potential laws, regulations and other requirements could increase our operating costs, reduce liquidity, delay operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nAmong the changes contained in President Obama\u2019s fiscal year 2016 budget proposal are the elimination or deferral of certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Such proposed changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for crude oil and gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and exploration and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. These proposed changes, if enacted, may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. The passage of legislation in response to President Obama\u2019s 2016 budget proposal or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or defer certain available tax deductions within the industry with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such changes could negatively affect our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to achieve our growth plan.\nRegulations under the Dodd-Frank Act regarding derivatives could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price risk and other risks associated with our business.\nFrom time to time, we may use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk. In 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other provisions, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. This financial reform legislation includes provisions that require many derivative transactions previously executed over-the-counter to be executed through an exchange and be centrally cleared. In addition, this legislation calls for the imposition of position limits for swaps, including swaps involving physical commodities such as crude oil and natural gas, which have been proposed but have not been finalized. It also calls for the establishment of margin requirements for uncleared swaps, which have not been finalized. If we do not qualify for the end user exception from any clearing requirements applicable to our swaps, the mandatory clearing requirements and revised capital requirements applicable to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps we use for managing commodity price risk. Some counterparties to our derivative instruments may also need or choose to spin off some of their derivative activities to a separate entity, which may not be as credit-worthy as our current counterparty.\nIf we do not qualify for the end user exemption from any applicable clearing requirements, the new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing derivative contracts, lead to fewer potential counterparties, impose new recordkeeping and documentation requirements, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. The proposed position limits may limit our ability to implement price risk management strategies if we are not able to qualify for any exemption from such limits. Additionally, the margin requirements for uncleared swaps if enacted may require us to post collateral, which could adversely affect our available liquidity. If our use of derivatives becomes limited as a result of the regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. Finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to crude oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition in the crude oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market crude oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing crude oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Certain of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased in recent years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEnergy conservation measures or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy could reduce the demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce.\nFuel conservation measures, governmental requirements for renewable energy resources, increasing consumer demand for alternative forms of energy, and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. The potential impact of changing demand for crude oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nWe depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. The loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel, including Harold G. Hamm, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nSome of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As of December 31, 2014, non-operated properties represented 22% of our estimated proved developed reserves, 14% of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves, and 17% of our estimated total proved reserves. We have limited ability to influence or control the operations or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures required to fund the development of such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners on these projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur credit facility and the indentures for our senior notes contain certain covenants and restrictions that may inhibit our ability to make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our goals.\nOur credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility also contains a requirement that we maintain a consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. This ratio represents the ratio of net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) divided by the sum of net debt plus total shareholders\u2019 equity.\nAt December 31, 2014, our consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio, as defined in the credit facility, was 0.55 to 1.00. Our total debt would need to independently increase by approximately $3.25 billion, or 54%, above existing levels at December 31, 2014 (with no corresponding increase in cash or reduction in refinanced debt) to reach the maximum covenant ratio of 0.65 to 1.00. Alternatively, our total shareholders' equity would need to independently decrease by approximately $1.75 billion, or 35%, below existing levels at December 31, 2014 to reach the maximum covenant ratio.\nThe indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among others, limit our ability to create liens securing certain indebtedness, enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer certain assets.\nThe covenants in our credit facility and senior note indentures may restrict our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of our credit facility or senior note indentures may be impacted by changes in economic or business conditions, results of operations or events beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility or senior note indentures, in which case, depending on the actions taken by the lenders or trustees thereunder or their successors or assignees, could result in all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. If our indebtedness is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be adversely affected by factors such as the availability, terms of and cost of capital, increases in interest rates, or a downgrade or other negative rating action with respect to our credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flows used for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. For example, as of February 17, 2015, outstanding borrowings under our credit facility were $605 million and the impact of a 1% increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in\nincreased annual interest expense of approximately $6.1 million and a $3.8 million decrease in our annual net income. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur principal exposure to credit risk is through the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production, which we market to energy marketing companies, refineries and affiliates ($566 million in receivables at December 31, 2014); our joint interest receivables ($568 million at December 31, 2014); and counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative instrument receivables ($84 million at December 31, 2014). Joint interest receivables arise from billing the individuals and entities who own a partial interest in the wells we operate. These individuals and entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases included in units on which we wish to drill. We can do very little to choose who participates in our wells. We are also subject to credit risk due to concentration of our crude oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers. The two largest purchasers of our crude oil and natural gas during the year ended December 31, 2014 accounted for a combined 25% of our total crude oil and natural gas revenues for the year. We generally do not require our counterparties to provide collateral to secure crude oil and natural gas sales receivables owed to us. Additionally, our use of derivative instruments involves the risk that our counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or reduce our earnings.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, from time to time we may enter into derivative instruments for a portion of our crude oil and/or natural gas production. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5. Derivative Instruments for a summary of our crude oil and natural gas commodity derivative positions. We do not designate any of our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and we record all derivative instruments on our balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments.\nDerivative instruments expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nproduction is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022\nthere is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received.\nIn addition, our derivative arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodity prices. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production, if any, is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions and our desire to stabilize cash flows necessary for the development of our crude oil and natural gas reserves. We may choose not to hedge future production if the pricing environment for certain time periods is not deemed to be favorable. Additionally, we may choose to liquidate existing derivative positions prior to the expiration of their contractual maturities in order to monetize favorable gain positions for the purpose of funding our capital program. In the fourth quarter of 2014, following a decrease in crude oil prices and related increase in the fair value of our derivative assets, substantially all of our outstanding crude oil derivative contracts were settled prior to the expiration of their contractual maturities, resulting in the receipt of cash proceeds totaling approximately $433 million. Consequently, our crude oil production and sales for 2015 and beyond are currently unhedged and directly exposed to continued volatility in crude oil market prices, whether favorable or unfavorable.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer owns approximately 68% of our outstanding common stock, giving him influence and control in corporate transactions and other matters, including a sale of our Company.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Harold G. Hamm, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 252,956,381 shares of our outstanding common stock, representing approximately 68% of our outstanding common shares. As a result, Mr. Hamm is our controlling shareholder and will continue to be able to control the election of our directors, determine our corporate and management policies and determine, without the consent of our other shareholders, the outcome of certain corporate transactions or other matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. As controlling shareholder, Mr. Hamm could cause, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company. The interests of Mr. Hamm may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nMr. Hamm has controlled in the past, and may control in the future, companies engaged in the business of gathering, processing, and marketing crude oil and natural gas or providing oilfield services in some of the areas where we have operations. We have historically entered into, and may enter into, transactions from time to time with affiliated companies if, after an independent review by our Audit Committee, it is determined such transactions are in the Company's best interests and are on terms no less favorable to us than could be achieved with an unaffiliated third party. These transactions may result in conflicts of interest between Mr. Hamm\u2019s affiliated companies and us. We can provide no assurance that any such conflicts will be resolved in our favor.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions.\nThe successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nrecoverable reserves;\n\u2022\nfuture crude oil and natural gas prices and their differentials;\n\u2022\nthe quality of the title to acquired properties;\n\u2022\nfuture development costs, operating costs and property taxes; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review, which we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices, of the subject properties. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities prior to acquisition. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller of the subject properties may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We sometimes are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, communicate with employees and business associates, perform compliance reporting and in many other activities related to our business. Our business associates, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business associates may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches, which could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or protected information, corruption of data or other disruptions of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nA cyber attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could disrupt our business and negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including:\n\u2022\nunauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, strategic information, or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources;\n\u2022\ndata corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge;\n\u2022\na cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt our major development projects; and\n\u2022\na cyber attack on a third party gathering, pipeline, or rail service provider could delay or prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues.\nThese events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTo date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.", "PERMNO": 91983, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CLR"}
