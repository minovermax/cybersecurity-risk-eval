{"cik": "883975", "company": "Microbot Medical Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our business, operating results, financial performance, and share price may be materially adversely affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to the following risk factors, any one of which could cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results or from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in other reports, press releases or other statements issued from time to time. Additional factors that may cause such a difference are set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to Microbot\u2019s Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nMicrobot has had no revenue and has incurred significant operating losses since inception and is expected to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company may never become profitable or, if achieved, be able to sustain profitability.\nMicrobot has incurred significant operating losses since its inception and expects to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as Microbot continues its preclinical and clinical development programs for its existing product candidates, primarily the SCS and Liberty devices; its research and development of any other future product candidates; and all other work necessary to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for its product candidates in the United States and other markets. In the future, Microbot intends to continue conducting micro-robotics research and development; performing necessary animal and clinical testing; working towards medical device regulatory compliance; and, if SCS, Liberty or other future product candidates are approved or cleared for commercial distribution, engaging in appropriate sales and marketing activities that, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will likely result in Microbot incurring further significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nMicrobot is a development-stage medical device company and currently generates no revenue from product sales, and may never be able to commercialize SCS, Liberty, TipCAT or other future product candidates. Microbot does not currently have the required approvals or clearances to market or test in humans SCS, Liberty, TipCAT, or any other future product candidates and Microbot may never receive them. Microbot does not anticipate generating significant revenues until it can successfully develop, commercialize and sell products derived from its product pipeline, of which Microbot can give no assurance. Even if Microbot or any of its future development partners succeed in commercializing any of its product candidates, Microbot may never generate revenues significant enough to achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with its product development pipeline and strategy, Microbot cannot accurately predict when it will achieve profitability, if ever. Failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of the Company and could impair its ability to raise capital, which may force the Company to curtail or discontinue its research and development programs and/or day-to-day operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that profitability, if achieved, can be sustained on an ongoing basis.\nMicrobot has a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for the Company\u2019s future viability.\nMicrobot has a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of its business plan or performance and prospects can be made. The business and prospects of Microbot must be considered in the light of the potential problems, delays, uncertainties and complications that may be encountered in connection with a newly established business. The risks include, but are not limited to, the possibility that Microbot will not be able to develop functional and scalable products, or that although functional and scalable, its products will not be economical to market; that its competitors hold proprietary rights that may preclude Microbot from marketing such products; that its competitors market a superior or equivalent product; that Microbot is not able to upgrade and enhance its technologies and products to accommodate new features and expanded service offerings; or the failure to receive necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for its products. To successfully introduce and market its products at a profit, Microbot must establish brand name recognition and competitive advantages for its products. There are no assurances that Microbot can successfully address these challenges. If it is unsuccessful, Microbot and its business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nMicrobot\u2019s operations to date have been limited to organizing the company, entering into licensing arrangements to initially obtain rights to its technologies, developing and securing its technologies, raising capital, developing regulatory and reimbursement strategies for its product candidates and preparing for pre-clinical and clinical trials of the SCS, Liberty and TipCAT. Microbot has not yet demonstrated its ability to successfully complete development of any product candidate, obtain marketing clearance or approval, manufacture a commercial-scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on its behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any predictions made about Microbot\u2019s future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if Microbot had a longer operating history.\nMicrobot may need additional funding. If Microbot is unable to raise capital when needed, it could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nTo date, Microbot has funded its operations primarily through offerings of debt and equity securities, grants and loans. Microbot does not know when, or if, it will generate any revenue, but does not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until it obtains regulatory clearance or approval of and commercializes one of its current or future product candidates. It is anticipated that the Company will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and that losses will increase as it continues the development of, and seeks regulatory review of, its product candidates, and begins to commercialize any approved or cleared products following a successful regulatory review.\nMicrobot expects the research and development expenses of the Company to increase substantially in future periods as it conducts pre-clinical studies in large animals and potentially clinical trials for its product candidates, and especially if it initiates additional research programs for future product candidates, including Liberty. In addition, if the Company obtains marketing clearance or approval for any of its product candidates, it expects to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing and sales. Microbot may also require additional funds for operations if it loses its current lawsuit with Empery and Hudson Bay, discussed in great detail elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Furthermore, Microbot incurs substantial costs associated with operating as a public company in the United States. Accordingly, the Company may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with its continuing operations through its projected profitability, of which it can give no assurance of success. If the Company is unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, it could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nAlthough the Company has no current and specific plans to raise additional capital, the Company intends to continue to opportunistically strengthen its balance sheet by raising additional funds through equity offerings or otherwise in order to meet expected future liquidity needs, including the introduction of the SCS device into the hydrocephalus and NPH market, and the introduction of Liberty. The Company\u2019s future capital requirements, generally, will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf the timing and outcomes of the product candidates\u2019 regulatory reviews, subsequent approvals or clearances, or other regulatory actions;\n\u25cf the final outcome of the Company\u2019s existing lawsuit with Empery and Hudson Bay;\n\u25cf the costs, design, duration and any potential delays of the clinical trials that could be conducted at the FDA\u2019s request using Microbot\u2019s product candidates;\n\u25cf the costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in new and existing businesses, product candidates and technologies;\n\u25cf the costs to maintain, expand and defend the scope of Microbot\u2019s intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf the costs to secure or establish sales, marketing and commercial manufacturing capabilities or arrangements with third parties regarding same;\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s need and ability to hire additional management and scientific and medical personnel; and\n\u25cf the costs to operate as a public company in the United States.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to the Company\u2019s investors, restrict its operations or require it to relinquish rights to its technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as the Company can generate substantial product revenues, it expects to finance its cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements, grants and debt financings. The Company does not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that the Company raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of its stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holder of the Company\u2019s common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting the Company\u2019s ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, declaring dividends or other distributions, selling or licensing intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its business.\nIf the Company raises additional funds through licensing, collaboration or similar arrangements, it may have to relinquish valuable rights to its technologies, future revenue streams, research and development programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to the Company. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, it may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that it would otherwise prefer to develop and market itself.\nAn epidemic of the coronavirus disease is ongoing and may result in significant disruptions to our clinical trials or other business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn epidemic of the coronavirus disease is ongoing throughout the world. As the outbreak is still evolving, much of its impact remains unknown. As of this filing, it is impossible to predict the effect and potential spread of the coronavirus disease globally. The coronavirus disease may cause significant delays and disruptions to our clinical trials and our interactions with the FDA. If the patients involved with our clinical trials become infected with the coronavirus disease, we may have more AEs and deaths in our clinical trials as a result. We may also face difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials if the patient populations that are eligible for our clinical trials are impacted by the coronavirus disease. Additionally, if our clinical trial patients are unable to travel to our clinical trial sites as a result of quarantines or other restrictions resulting from the coronavirus disease, we may experience higher drop-out rates or delays in our clinical trials, and some patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services, which could impact our ability to determine the efficacy or safety of our SCS or Liberty device. Site initiation and patient enrollment may also be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 outbreak.\nAdditionally, travel restrictions have been implemented with respect to certain countries in an effort to contain the coronavirus disease, and several countries have expanded screenings of travelers. As travel restrictions are increasingly implemented and extended to other countries, we and our contract research organizations may be unable to visit our clinical trial sites and monitor the data from our clinical trials on timely basis. Our employees may also face travel restrictions, which would impact our business. Furthermore, some of our manufacturers and suppliers are in Europe and may be impacted by port closures and other restrictions resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, which may disrupt our supply chain or limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our products.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change, and we cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the suppliers, clinical trial sites, contract research organizations, regulators, including the FDA health care providers and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business and operations could be materially and negatively impacted, which could prevent or delay us from obtaining approval for our SCS and Liberty devices.\nRisks Relating to the Development and Commercialization of Microbot\u2019s Product Candidates\nUnsuccessful animal studies, clinical trials or procedures relating to product candidates under development could have a material adverse effect on Microbot\u2019s prospects.\nThe regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive data and procedures, including the development of regulatory and quality standards and, potentially, certain clinical studies. Unfavorable or inconsistent data from current or future clinical trials or other studies conducted by Microbot or third parties, or perceptions regarding such data, could adversely affect Microbot\u2019s ability to obtain necessary device clearance or approval and the market\u2019s view of Microbot\u2019s future prospects. Specifically, the interim data of our animal trial with respect to the SCS device suggests that the animal trial results are inconclusive to assess safety. As a result, we have submitted the existing data to the FDA as part of a pre-submission meeting where, after the FDA\u2019s review, we hope to apply for a limited clinical investigation of the device known as an Early Feasibility Study (EFS). We can give no assurance that the FDA will agree that an EFS is warranted, in which case we will have to re-commence animal trials or otherwise re-evaluate our the FDA approval process, which could delay and hinder our ability to commercialize the SCS device.\nFailure to successfully complete these studies, or any similar studies with respect to any of our other product candidates, in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on Microbot\u2019s prospects with respect to the SCS device or such other product candidates. Because animal trials, clinical trials and other types of scientific studies are inherently uncertain, there can be no assurance that these trials or studies will be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner or result in a commercially viable product. Clinical trials or studies may experience significant setbacks even if earlier preclinical or animal studies have shown promising results. Furthermore, preliminary results from clinical trials may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis. Results from clinical trials may also not be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience. If preliminary clinical results are later contradicted, or if initial results cannot be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience, Microbot\u2019s business could be adversely affected. Clinical trials also may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks. The FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our clinical trials, or may find the clinical trial design, conduct or results inadequate to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the product candidate. The FDA may also require additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials which could further delay approval of our product candidates.\nMicrobot\u2019s business depends heavily on the success of its lead product candidates, the SCS and Liberty. If Microbot is unable to commercialize the SCS or Liberty, or experiences significant delays in doing so, Microbot\u2019s business will be materially harmed.\nAs stated above, the interim data of the animal trial with respect to the SCS device indicates that the animal trial results are inconclusive to assess safety. We have submitted the existing data to the FDA as part of a pre-submission meeting where, after the FDA\u2019s review, we hope to apply for an EFS. However, we can give no assurance that the FDA will agree that an EFS is warranted, in which case we will have to re-commence animal trials or otherwise re-evaluate the FDA approval process, which could delay, hinder or even cause a halt to our ability to commercialize the SCS device.\nGenerally, after all necessary clinical and performance data supporting the safety and effectiveness of the SCS or Liberty devices, or any other product candidate, are collected, Microbot must still obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the device and those regulatory processes can take several months to several years to be completed. Therefore, Microbot\u2019s ability to generate product revenues will not occur for at least the next few years, if at all, and will depend heavily on the successful commercialization of SCS device and/or the Liberty device, or any of our other product candidates from time to time. The success of commercializing any of our product candidates, include the SCS and Liberty devices, will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf our ability to obtain additional capital;\n\u25cf With respect to the SCS device, approval of the FDA to participate in an EFS program and/or successful completion of animal studies and, if necessary, additional human clinical trials (beyond the EFS trials) and the collection of sufficient data to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use;\n\u25cf With respect to all of our product candidates, successful completion of animal studies and, if necessary, human clinical trials and the collection of sufficient data to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use;\n\u25cf receipt of marketing approvals or clearances from the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf establishing commercial manufacturing arrangements with one or more third parties;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protections;\n\u25cf protecting Microbot\u2019s rights in its intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u25cf generating commercial sales, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with other entities;\n\u25cf acceptance of our product candidates, if and when commercially launched, by the medical community, patients and third-party payors;\n\u25cf effectively competing with existing and competitive products on the market and any new competing products that may enter the market; and\n\u25cf maintaining quality and an acceptable safety profile of our products following clearance or approval.\nIf Microbot does not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, it could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize the SCS, Liberty or any other product candidate, which would materially harm its business.\nMicrobot\u2019s ability to expand its technology platforms for other uses, including endovascular neurosurgery other than for the treatment of hydrocephalus, may be limited.\nAfter spending time working with experts in the field, Microbot has decided to no longer pursue the use of TipCAT in colonoscopy and has instead committed to focus on expanding all of its technology platforms for use in segments of the endovascular neurosurgery market, including traumatic brain injury, to capitalize on its existing competencies in hydrocephalus and the market\u2019s needs. Microbot\u2019s ability to expand its technology platforms for use in the endovascular neurosurgery market will be limited by its ability to develop and/or refine the necessary technology, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for their use on humans, and the marketing of its products and otherwise obtaining market acceptance of its product in the United States and in other countries.\nMicrobot operates in a competitive industry and if its competitors have products that are marketed more effectively or develop products, treatments or procedures that are similar, more advanced, safer or more effective, its commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated, which would materially harm its business.\nOur competitors may develop products, treatments or procedures that directly compete with our products and potential products and which are similar, more advanced, safer or more effective than ours. The medical device industry is very competitive and subject to significant technological and practice changes. Microbot expects to face competition from many different sources with respect to the SCS, Liberty and other products that it is seeking to develop or commercialize with respect to its other product candidates in the future.\nCompeting against large established competitors with significant resources may make establishing a market for any products that it develops difficult which would have a material adverse effect on Microbot\u2019s business. Microbot\u2019s commercial opportunities could also be reduced or eliminated if its competitors develop and commercialize products, treatments or procedures quicker, that are safer, more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than the SCS, Liberty or any product that Microbot may develop. Many of Microbot\u2019s potential competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than Microbot may have. Mergers and acquisitions in the medical device industry market may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of Microbot\u2019s potential competitors.\nAt this time, Microbot does not know whether the FDA will require it to submit clinical data in support of its future marketing applications for its SCS product candidate, particularly in light of recent initiatives by the FDA to enhance and modernize its approach to medical device safety and innovation, which creates uncertainty for Microbot as well as the possibility of increased product development costs and time to market.\nAlthough Microbot has identified a predicate device for its lead product candidate, the SCS, which it intended to use in its 510(k) application, it may determine that a 510(k) de novo application is more appropriate for the SCS. If the Company determines to proceed with the 510(k) application and the FDA agrees with the Company\u2019s determination, the SCS will be classified by the FDA as Class II and eligible for marketing pursuant to FDA clearance through the 510(k) application. However, in light of recent initiatives by the FDA relating to safety, efficacy and the inconclusive results of the animal and laboratory trial, there is no guarantee that the FDA will agree with the Company\u2019s determination or that the FDA would accept the predicate device that Microbot intends to submit in its 510(k). The FDA also may request additional data in response to a 510(k), or require Microbot to conduct further testing or compile more data in support of its 510(k). Such additional data could include clinical data that must be derived from human clinical studies that are designed appropriately to address the potential questions from the FDA regarding a proposed product\u2019s safety or effectiveness. It is unclear at this time whether and how various activities recently initiated or announced by the FDA to modernize the U.S. medical device regulatory system could affect the marketing pathway or timeline for our product candidate, given the timing and the undeveloped nature of some of the FDA\u2019s new medical device safety and innovation initiatives. One of the recent initiatives was announced in April 2018, when the FDA Commissioner issued a statement with the release of a Medical Device Safety Action Plan. Among other key areas of the Medical Device Safety Action Plan, the Commissioner stated that the FDA is \u201cexploring what further actions we can take to spur innovation towards technologies that can make devices and their use safer. For instance, our Breakthrough Device Program that helps address unmet medical needs can be used to facilitate patient access to innovative new devices that have important improvements to patient safety. We\u2019re considering developing a similar program to support the development of safer devices that do not otherwise meet the Breakthrough Program criteria, but are clearly intended to be safer than currently available technologies.\u201d This type of program may negatively affect our existing development plan for the SCS or any other product candidate or it may benefit Microbot, but at this time those potential impacts from recent FDA medical device initiatives are unknown and uncertain. Similarly, the FDA Commissioner announced various agency goals under a Medical Innovation Access Plan in 2017.\nIf the FDA does require clinical data to be submitted as part of the SCS marketing submission, any type of clinical study performed in humans will require the investment of substantial expense, professional resources and time. In order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, a company must, among other things, apply for and obtain Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a \u201csignificant risk\u201d (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application. Microbot may not be able to obtain FDA and/or IRB approval to undertake clinical trials in the United States for any new devices Microbot intends to market in the United States in the future. Moreover, the timing of the commencement, continuation and completion of any future clinical trial may be subject to significant delays attributable to various causes, including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria, failure of patients to complete the clinical trial, delay in or failure to obtain IRB approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site, and shortages of supply in the investigational device.\nThus, the addition of one or more mandatory clinical trials to the development timeline for the SCS, Liberty or any other product candidate would significantly increase the costs associated with developing and commercializing the product and delay the timing of U.S. regulatory authorization. The current uncertainty regarding near-term medical device regulatory changes by the FDA could further affect our development plans for the SCS, Liberty or any other product candidate, depending on their nature, scope and applicability. Microbot and its business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected as a result of any such costs, delays or uncertainty.\nThe FDA may disagree with Microbot\u2019s determination that the SCS is a Class II device or that the chosen predicate device (or any predicate device) is appropriate for a substantial equivalence comparison to the SCS.\nAlthough the Company intended to submit a 501(k) application for the SCS, the Company is now considering that the FDA may determine that the SCS is a Class III device because there is no appropriate predicate device for substantial equivalence comparison, which would require Microbot to submit a De Novo classification request or an application for premarket approval (\u201cPMA\u201d). Both De Novo requests and PMA applications require applicants to prepare information and data about device safety and efficacy in addition to the 510(k) requirements, including a benefit-risk analysis, a discussion of proposed general and special controls to eliminate or mitigate device risks, and additional testing data. PMA applications almost always require data from human clinical studies, and while De Novo requests do not require human clinical study data, in most cases, such data is necessary to demonstrate that the FDA can appropriately classify the device as Class II.\nAny type of clinical study performed in humans (including the EFS) will require the investment of substantial expense, professional resources and time. In order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, a company must, among other things, apply for and obtain Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a \u201csignificant risk\u201d (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application. Microbot may not be able to obtain FDA and/or IRB approval to undertake clinical trials in the United States for any new devices Microbot intends to market in the United States in the future. Moreover, the timing of the commencement, continuation and completion of any future clinical trial may be subject to significant delays attributable to various causes, including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria, failure of patients to complete the clinical trial, delay in or failure to obtain IRB approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site, and shortages of supply in the investigational device. Thus, the addition of one or more mandatory clinical trials to the development timeline for the SCS would significantly increase the costs associated with developing and commercializing the product and delay the timing of U.S. regulatory authorization.\nFurthermore, if Microbot is required to submit a De Novo request or PMA application instead of a 510(k), the FDA review process may take significantly more time. While the FDA commits to reviewing 510(k)s in 90 days, the review period for De Novo requests and PMA applications is 150 days and 180 days, respectively. After an initial review of our De Novo request or PMA application, the FDA may request additional information or data which can significantly delay an ultimate decision on our submission.\nThus, submitting a De Novo request or PMA application for the SCS would significantly increase the costs associated with developing and commercializing the product and delay the timing of U.S. regulatory authorization. Microbot and its business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected as a result of any such costs or delays.\nMicrobot\u2019s CardioSert technology is subject to a buy-back clause which, if triggered, could cause us to lose rights to the technology and delay or curtail the development of our products.\nPursuant to the Agreement we entered into in January 2018 to acquire the CardioSert technology, we are required to meet certain commercialization deadlines or CardioSert may terminate the agreement and buy back the technology for $1.00, subject to certain limited exceptions. The first such commercialization deadline is January 4, 2021, and the next is in 2022. At this time, we have not met any of the commercialization deadlines, and we can give no assurance that we will do so.\nFailure to meet the applicable commercialization deadlines and any resulting sale back of the technology to CardioSert could materially adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize, or materially delay the development and commercialization of, our planned Liberty device.\nMicrobot has no prior experience in conducting clinical trials and will depend upon the ability of third parties, including contract research organizations, collaborative academic groups, future clinical trial sites and investigators, to conduct or to assist the Company in conducting clinical trials for its product candidates, if such trials become necessary.\nAs a development-stage, pre-clinical company, Microbot has no prior experience in designing, initiating, conducting and monitoring human clinical trials. Microbot will depend upon its ability and/or the ability of future collaborators, contract research organizations, clinical trial sites and investigators to successfully design, initiate, conduct and monitor such clinical trials.\nFailure by Microbot or by any of these future collaborating parties to timely and effectively initiate, conduct and monitor a future clinical trial could significantly delay or materially impair Microbot\u2019s ability to complete those clinical trials and/or obtain regulatory clearance or approval of its product candidates and, consequently, could delay or materially impair its ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of those products.\nIf the commercial opportunity for SCS, Liberty and any other commercial products that may be developed by Microbot is smaller than Microbot anticipates, Microbot\u2019s future revenue from SCS, Liberty and such other products will be adversely affected and Microbot\u2019s business will suffer.\nIf the size of the commercial opportunities in any of Microbot\u2019s target markets is smaller than it anticipates, Microbot may not be able to achieve profitability and growth. For instance, Microbot is developing SCS as a device for the treatment of hydrocephalus and NPH. It is difficult to predict the penetration, future growth rate or size of the market for Microbot\u2019s product candidate.\nThe commercial success of the SCS, Liberty or any other product candidates will require broad acceptance of the devices by the doctors and other medical professionals who specialize in the procedures targeted by each device, a limited number of whom may be able to influence device selection and purchasing decisions. If Microbot\u2019s technologies are not broadly accepted and perceived as having significant advantages over existing medical devices, then it will not meet its business objectives. Such perceptions are likely to be based on a determination by medical facilities and physicians that Microbot\u2019s product candidates are safe and effective, are cost-effective in comparison to existing devices, and represent acceptable methods of treatment. Microbot cannot assure that it will be able to establish the relationships and arrangements with medical facilities and physicians necessary to support the market uptake of its product candidates. In addition, its competitors may develop new technologies for the same markets Microbot is targeting that are more attractive to medical facilities and physicians. If doctors and other medical professionals do not consider Microbot product candidates to be suitable for application in the procedures we are targeting and an improvement over the use of existing or competing products, Microbot\u2019s business goals will not be realized.\nCustomers will be unlikely to buy the SCS, Liberty or any other product candidates unless Microbot can demonstrate that they can be produced for sale to consumers at attractive prices.\nTo date, Microbot has focused primarily on research and development of the first generation versions of the SCS, as well as initial development of the Liberty device. Consequently, Microbot has no experience in manufacturing its product candidates, and intends to manufacture its product candidates through third-party manufacturers. Microbot can offer no assurance that either it or its manufacturing partners will develop efficient, automated, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards or production volumes required to successfully mass produce its commercial products. Even if its manufacturing partners are successful in developing such manufacturing capability and quality processes, including the assurance of GMP-compliant device manufacturing, there can be no assurance that Microbot can timely meet its product commercialization schedule or the production and delivery requirements of potential customers. A failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities could have a material adverse effect on Microbot\u2019s business and financial results.\nThe proposed price of Microbot\u2019s product candidates, once approved for sale, will be dependent on material and other manufacturing costs. Microbot cannot offer any assurances that its manufacturing partner will be able manufacture its product candidates at a competitive price or that achieving cost reductions will not cause a reduction in the performance, reliability and longevity of its product candidates.\nMicrobot will rely on third party design houses for the redesign of the CardioSert guidewire to other specific indications.\nSince the CardioSert Guidewire was originally designed for treating chronic total occlusions, the design will need to be modified to treat other indications. As we do not specialize in the design of guidewires and microcatheters, we will rely on third party design houses that specialize in this type of design. Such designs may require several design and regulatory iterations prolonging the product release and certification, which could delay the commercialization of our planned Liberty device.\nMicrobot has relied on, and intends to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers to produce its product candidates.\nMicrobot currently relies, and expects to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party manufacturers to produce and supply its product candidates, and it expects to rely on third parties to manufacture the commercialized products as well, should they receive the necessary regulatory clearance or approval. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which Microbot would not be subject if Microbot manufactured its product candidates or future commercial products itself, including:\n\u25cf limitations on supply availability resulting from capacity, internal operational problems or scheduling constraints of third parties;\n\u25cf potential regulatory non-compliance or other violations by the third-party manufacturer that could result in quality assurance issues or government enforcement action that has a negative effect on Microbot\u2019s product candidates and distribution strategy;\n\u25cf the possible breach of manufacturing agreements by third parties because of various factors beyond Microbot\u2019s control; and\n\u25cf the possible termination or non-renewal of manufacturing agreements by third parties for various reasons beyond Microbot\u2019s control, at a time that is costly or inconvenient to Microbot.\nIf Microbot is not able to maintain its key manufacturing relationships, Microbot may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop its own manufacturing capabilities, which could delay or impair Microbot\u2019s ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for its product candidates and could substantially increase its costs or deplete profit margins, if any. If Microbot does find replacement manufacturers, Microbot may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to it and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities.\nAdditionally, the existing design of the CardioSert device was produced in very low quantities by the seller of the technology. Accordingly, the scaling-up to high volume production may require significant changes to the existing design and production methods. These changes may have significant negative implications in price and time to market of the CardioSert system.\nIf Microbot\u2019s product candidates are not considered to be a safe and effective alternative to existing technologies, Microbot will not be commercially successful.\nThe SCS, Liberty and TipCAT rely on new technologies, and Microbot\u2019s success will depend on acceptance of these technologies by the medical community as safe, clinically effective, cost effective and a preferred device as compared to products of its competitors. Microbot does not have long-term data regarding efficacy, safety and clinical outcomes associated with the use of SCS, Liberty or TipCAT. Any data that is generated in the future may not be positive or may not support the product candidates\u2019 regulatory dossiers, which would negatively affect market acceptance and the rate at which its product candidates are adopted. Equally important will be physicians\u2019 perceptions of the safety of Microbot\u2019s product candidates because Microbot\u2019s technologies are relatively new. If, over the long term, Microbot\u2019s product candidates do not meet surgeons\u2019 expectations as to safety, efficacy and ease of use, they may not become widely adopted.\nMarket acceptance of Microbot\u2019s product candidates will also be affected by other factors, including Microbot\u2019s ability to convince key opinion leaders to provide recommendations regarding its product candidates; convince distributors that its technologies are attractive alternatives to existing and competing technologies; supply and service sufficient quantities of products directly or through marketing alliances; and price products competitively in light of the current macroeconomic environment, which is becoming increasingly price sensitive.\nMicrobot may be subject to penalties and may be precluded from marketing its product candidates if Microbot fails to comply with extensive governmental regulations.\nMicrobot believes that its medical device product candidates will be categorized as Class II devices, which typically require a 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo premarket submission to the FDA. However, the FDA has not made any determination about whether Microbot\u2019s medical product candidates are Class II medical devices and may disagree with that classification. If the FDA determines that Microbot\u2019s product candidates should be reclassified as Class III medical devices, Microbot could be precluded from marketing the devices for clinical use within the United States for months, years or longer, depending on the specifics of the change in classification. Reclassification of any of Microbot\u2019s product candidates as Class III medical devices could significantly increase Microbot\u2019s regulatory costs, including the timing and expense associated with required clinical trials and other costs.\nThe FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities require that Microbot product candidates be manufactured according to rigorous standards. These regulatory requirements significantly increase Microbot\u2019s production costs, which may prevent Microbot from offering products within the price range and in quantities necessary to meet market demands. If Microbot or one of its third-party manufacturers changes an approved manufacturing process, the FDA may need to review the process before it may be used. Failure to comply with applicable pre-market and post-market regulatory requirements could subject Microbot to enforcement actions, including warning letters, fines, injunctions and civil penalties, recall or seizure of its products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of its production, and criminal prosecution.\nIf Microbot is not able to both obtain and maintain adequate levels of third-party reimbursement for procedures involving its product candidates after they are approved for marketing and launched commercially, it would have a material adverse effect on Microbot\u2019s business.\nHealthcare providers and related facilities are generally reimbursed for their services through payment systems managed by various governmental agencies worldwide, private insurance companies, and managed care organizations. The manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care, the procedure(s) performed, the final patient diagnosis, the device(s) utilized, available budget, or a combination of these factors, and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payor\u2019s discretion. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of these third-party payors may impact the decisions of healthcare providers and facilities regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products. Microbot cannot assure you that its sales will not be impeded and its business harmed if third-party payors fail to provide reimbursement for Microbot products that healthcare providers view as adequate.\nIn the United States, Microbot expects that its product candidates, once approved, will be purchased primarily by medical institutions, which then bill various third-party payors, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, which administers the Medicare program through Medicare Administrative Contractors, and other government health care programs and private insurance plans, for the healthcare products and services provided to their patients. The process involved in applying for coverage and incremental reimbursement from CMS is lengthy and expensive. Moreover, many private payors look to CMS in setting their reimbursement policies and amounts. If CMS or other agencies limit coverage for procedures utilizing Microbot\u2019s products or decrease or limit reimbursement payments for doctors and hospitals utilizing Microbot\u2019s products, this may affect coverage and reimbursement determinations by many private payors.\nIf a procedure involving a medical device is not reimbursed separately by a government or private insurer, then a medical institution would have to absorb the cost of Microbot\u2019s products as part of the cost of the procedure in which the products are used. At this time, Microbot does not know the extent to which medical institutions would consider insurers\u2019 payment levels adequate to cover the cost of its products. Failure by hospitals and surgeons to receive an amount that they consider to be adequate reimbursement for procedures in which Microbot products are used could deter them from purchasing Microbot products and limit sales growth for those products.\nMicrobot has no control over payor decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for its medical device product candidates, once they are approved. Additionally, Microbot expects many payors to continue to explore cost-containment strategies (e.g., comparative and cost-effectiveness analyses, so-called \u201cpay-for-performance\u201d programs implemented by various public government health care programs and private third-party payors, and expansion of payment bundling initiatives, and other such methods that shift medical cost risk to providers) that may potentially impact coverage and/or payment levels for Microbot\u2019s current product candidates or products Microbot develops in the future.\nAs Microbot\u2019s product offerings are used across diverse healthcare settings, they will be affected to varying degrees by the different payment systems.\nClinical outcome studies for the SCS may not provide sufficient data to make Microbot\u2019s product candidates the standard of care.\nMicrobot\u2019s business plan relies on the broad adoption by surgeons of the SCS for primary shunt placement procedures to prevent shunt occlusions. Although Microbot believes the occurrence of shunt occlusion complications is well known among physicians practicing in the relevant medical fields, SCS may be adopted for replacement shunt surgeries only. Neurosurgeons may adopt SCS for primary shunt placement procedures only upon additional clinical studies with longer follow up periods, if at all. It may also be necessary to provide outcome studies on the preventative capabilities of the SCS in order to convince the medical community of its safety and efficacy. Clinical studies may not show an advantage in SCS based procedures in a timely manner, or at all, and outcome studies have not been designed at this time, and may be too large and too costly for Microbot to conduct. Both situations could prevent broad adoption of the SCS and materially impact Microbot\u2019s business.\nMicrobot products may in the future be subject to mandatory product recalls that could harm its reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could pose a risk of injury to patients. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death, although in most cases this mandatory recall authority is not used because manufacturers typically initiate a voluntary recall when a device violation is discovered. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of Microbot products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by Microbot or one of its distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any Microbot products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on Microbot\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, and any future recall announcements could harm Microbot\u2019s reputation with customers and negatively affect its sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action, including any of the following sanctions for failing to timely report a recall to the FDA:\n\u25cf untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u25cf detention or seizure of Microbot products;\n\u25cf operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modified products;\n\u25cf withdrawing 510(k) clearances or other types of regulatory authorizations -that have already been granted;\n\u25cf refusing to grant export approval for Microbot products; or\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nIf Microbot\u2019s future commercialized products cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, Microbot will be subject to Medical Device Reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder FDA regulations, Microbot will be required to report to the FDA any incident in which a marketed medical device product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which a medical device malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. In addition, all manufacturers placing medical devices in European Union markets are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the relevant authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred.\nMicrobot anticipates that in the future it is likely that we may experience events that would require reporting to the FDA pursuant to the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulations. Any adverse event involving a Microbot product could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as product actions or customer notifications, or agency actions, such as inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending Microbot in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nMicrobot could be exposed to significant liability claims if Microbot is unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs and adequate levels or otherwise protect itself against potential product liability claims.\nThe testing, manufacture, marketing and sale of medical devices entail the inherent risk of liability claims or product recalls. Product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A successful product liability claim or product recall could inhibit or prevent the successful commercialization of Microbot\u2019s products, cause a significant financial burden on Microbot, or both, which in any case could have a material adverse effect on Microbot\u2019s business and financial condition.\nThe results of Microbot\u2019s research and development efforts are uncertain and there can be no assurance of the commercial success of Microbot\u2019s product candidates.\nMicrobot believe that its success will depend in part on its ability to expand its product offerings and continue to improve its existing product candidates in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. As such, Microbot expects to continue dedicating significant resources in research and development. The product candidates and services being developed by Microbot may not be technologically successful. In addition, the length of Microbot\u2019s product candidates and service development cycle may be greater than Microbot originally expected.\nOur business strategy in part relies on identifying, acquiring and developing complementary technologies and products, which entails risks which could negatively affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nWe may pursue other acquisitions of businesses and technologies. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, services and products;\n\u25cf failure to achieve expected synergies;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies;\n\u25cf amortization of acquired intangible assets, which could reduce future reported earnings;\n\u25cf potential loss of clients or key employees of acquired companies; and\n\u25cf dilution to existing stockholders.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may consider, and from time to time may engage in, discussions and negotiations regarding transactions, such as acquisitions, mergers and combinations within our industry. The purchase price for possible acquisitions could be paid in cash, through the issuance of common stock or other securities, borrowings or a combination of these methods.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, consummate and successfully integrate acquisitions, and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. For example, we could begin negotiations that we subsequently decide to suspend or terminate for a variety of reasons. However, opportunities may arise from time to time that we will evaluate. Any transactions that we consummate would involve risks and uncertainties to us. These risks could cause the failure of any anticipated benefits of an acquisition to be realized, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf Microbot fails to retain certain of its key personnel and attract and retain additional qualified personnel, Microbot might not be able to pursue its growth strategy effectively.\nMicrobot is dependent on its senior management, in particular Harel Gadot, Microbot\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Although Microbot believes that its relationship with members of its senior management is positive, there can be no assurance that the services of any of these individuals will continue to be available to Microbot in the future. Microbot\u2019s future success will depend in part on its ability to retain its management and scientific teams, to identify, hire and retain additional qualified personnel with expertise in research and development and sales and marketing, and to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, when necessary. Competition for qualified personnel in the medical device industry is intense and finding and retaining qualified personnel with experience in the industry is very difficult. Microbot believes that there are only a limited number of individuals with the requisite skills to serve in key positions at Microbot, particularly in Israel, and it competes for key personnel with other medical equipment and technology companies, as well as research institutions.\nMicrobot does not carry, and does not intend to carry, any key man life insurance policies on any of its existing executive officers.\nRisks Relating to International Business\nIf Microbot fails to obtain regulatory clearances in other countries for its product candidates under development, Microbot will not be able to commercialize these product candidates in those countries.\nIn order for Microbot to market its product candidates in countries other than the United States, it must comply with the safety and quality regulations in such countries.\nIn Europe, these regulations, including the requirements for approvals, clearance or grant of Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne, or CE, Certificates of Conformity and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Failure to obtain regulatory approval, clearance or CE Certificates of Conformity (or equivalent) in any foreign country in which Microbot plans to market its product candidates may harm its ability to generate revenue and harm its business. Approval and CE marking procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval or CE Certificate of Conformity in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA clearance. The regulatory approval or CE marking process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA clearance in the United States. Regulatory approval or the CE marking of a product candidate in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects described above regarding FDA clearance in the United States.\nMicrobot cannot be certain that it will be successful in complying with the requirements of the CE Certificate of Conformity and receiving a CE Mark for its product candidates or in continuing to meet the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive in the European Economic Area (EEA).\nIsrael\u2019s Medical Devices Law generally requires the registration of all medical products with the Ministry of Health, or MOH, Registrar through the submission of an application to the Ministry of Health Medical Institutions and Devices Licensing Department, or AMAR. If the application includes a certificate issued by a competent authority of a \u201crecognized\u201d country, which includes Australia, Canada, the European Community Member States, Japan or the United States, the registration process is expedited, but is generally still expected to take 6 to 9 months for approval. If certification from a recognized country is not available, the registration process takes significantly longer and a license is rarely issued under such circumstances, as the MOH may require the presentation of significant additional clinical data. Once granted, a license (marketing authorization) for a medical device is valid for five years from the date of registration of the device, except for implants with a life-supporting function, for which the validity is for only two years from the date of registration. Furthermore, the holder of the license must meet several additional requirements to maintain the license. Microbot cannot be certain that it will be successful in applying for a license from the MOH for its product candidates.\nMicrobot operations in international markets involve inherent risks that Microbot may not be able to control.\nMicrobot\u2019s business plan includes the marketing and sale of its proposed product candidates internationally, and specifically in Europe and Israel. Accordingly, Microbot\u2019s results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of factors relating to international business operations that it may or may not be able to control, including:\n\u25cf adverse macroeconomic conditions affecting geographies where Microbot intends to do business;\n\u25cf closing of international borders, including as a result of biohazards or pandemics;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region;\n\u25cf higher costs of doing business in certain foreign countries;\n\u25cf infringement claims on foreign patents, copyrights or trademark rights;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing operations across disparate geographic areas;\n\u25cf difficulties associated with enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights through foreign legal systems;\n\u25cf trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements, which affect Microbot\u2019s ability to import or export its product candidates from or to various countries;\n\u25cf adverse tax consequences;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf military conflict, terrorist activities, natural disasters and medical epidemics; and\n\u25cf Microbot\u2019s ability to recruit and retain channel partners in foreign jurisdictions.\nMicrobot\u2019s financial results may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates and Microbot\u2019s current currency hedging strategy may not be sufficient to counter such fluctuations.\nMicrobot\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and the financial results of the Company are denominated in U.S. dollars, while a significant portion of Microbot\u2019s business is conducted, and a substantial portion of its operating expenses are payable, in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Exchange rate fluctuations may have an adverse impact on Microbot\u2019s future revenues or expenses as presented in the financial statements. Microbot may in the future use financial instruments, such as forward foreign currency contracts, in its management of foreign currency exposure. These contracts would primarily require Microbot to purchase and sell certain foreign currencies with or for U.S. dollars at contracted rates. Microbot may be exposed to a credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties of these contracts. In addition, these financial instruments may not adequately manage Microbot\u2019s foreign currency exposure. Microbot\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected if Microbot is unable to successfully manage currency fluctuations in the future.\nRisks Relating to Microbot\u2019s Intellectual Property\nMicrobot\u2019s right to develop and commercialize the SCS and TipCAT product candidates are subject to the terms and condition of a license granted to Microbot by Technion Research and Development Foundation Ltd. and termination of the license with respect to one or both of the technology platforms underlying the product candidates would result in Microbot ceasing its development efforts for the applicable product candidate(s).\nMicrobot entered into a license agreement with Technion Research and Development Foundation Ltd., or TRDF, in 2012 pursuant to which Microbot obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license to certain patents and inventions relating to the SCS and TipCAT technology platforms. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, in order to maintain the license with respect to each platform, Microbot must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop products covered by the license, including meeting certain agreed upon development milestones. TRDF has the option to terminate a license granted with respect a particular technology in the event Microbot fails to meet a development milestone associated with such technology. Therefore, the failure to meet development milestones may lead to a complete termination of the applicable license agreement and result in Microbot ceasing its development efforts for the applicable product candidate. The milestones for both SCS and TipCAT include commencing first in human clinical trials by December 2021. Failure to meet any development milestone will give TRDF the right to terminate the license with respect to the technology underlying the missed milestone. TRDF has previously demonstrated flexibility with respect to amending the terms of the license to extend the milestone dates, although we can give no assurance at this time that TRDF will continue to be so flexible with respect to amending the terms of the license.\nUnder the license agreement, Microbot is also subject to various other obligations, including obligations with respect to payment upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales. TRDF may terminate the license agreement under certain circumstances, including material breaches by Microbot or under certain bankruptcy or insolvency events. In the case of termination of the license by Microbot without cause or by TRDF for cause, TRDF has the right to receive a non-exclusive license from Microbot with respect to improvements to the licensed technologies made by Microbot.\nIf TRDF were to terminate the license agreement or if Microbot was to otherwise lose the ability to exploit the licensed patents, Microbot\u2019s competitive advantage could be reduced or terminated, and Microbot will likely not be able to find a source to replace the licensed technology.\nAdditionally, if there is any future dispute between Microbot and TRDF regarding the respective parties\u2019 rights under the license agreement, Microbot\u2019s ability to develop and commercialize the SCS and TipCAT may be materially harmed.\nMicrobot may not meet its product candidates\u2019 development and commercialization objectives in a timely manner or at all.\nMicrobot has established internal goals, based upon expectations with respect to its technologies, which Microbot has used to assess its progress toward developing its product candidates. These goals relate to technology and design improvements as well as to dates for achieving specific development results. If the product candidates exhibit technical defects or are unable to meet cost or performance goals, Microbot\u2019s commercialization schedule could be delayed and potential purchasers of its initial commercialized products may decline to purchase such products or may opt to pursue alternative products, which would materially harm its business.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause Microbot to incur significant expenses or prevent Microbot from selling certain of its product candidates.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation. From time to time, Microbot might be the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation. Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of Microbot\u2019s management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against Microbot could result in its payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact its ability to sell current or future products in the affected category and could have a material adverse effect on its business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf Microbot or TRDF are unable to protect the patents or other proprietary rights relating to Microbot\u2019s product candidates, or if Microbot infringes on the patents or other proprietary rights of others, Microbot\u2019s competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.\nMicrobot\u2019s success depends on its ability to protect its intellectual property (including its licensed intellectual property) and its proprietary technologies. Microbot\u2019s commercial success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection for its product candidates, proprietary technologies, and their uses, as well as its ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.\nMicrobot currently holds, through licenses or otherwise, an intellectual property portfolio that includes U.S. and international patents and pending patents, and other patents under development. Microbot intends to continue to seek legal protection, primarily through patents, including the TRDF licensed patents, for its proprietary technology. Seeking patent protection is a lengthy and costly process, and there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any pending applications, or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be sufficiently broad or strong to protect its proprietary technology. There is also no guarantee that any patents Microbot holds, through licenses or otherwise, will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the patent rights granted will provide competitive advantages to Microbot. Microbot\u2019s competitors have developed and may continue to develop and obtain patents for technologies that are similar or superior to Microbot\u2019s technologies. In addition, the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which Microbot develops, manufactures or sells its product candidates may not protect Microbot\u2019s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nAdverse outcomes in current or future legal disputes regarding patent and other intellectual property rights could result in the loss of Microbot\u2019s intellectual property rights, subject Microbot to significant liabilities to third parties, require Microbot to seek licenses from third parties on terms that may not be reasonable or favorable to Microbot, prevent Microbot from manufacturing, importing or selling its product candidates, or compel Microbot to redesign its product candidates to avoid infringing third parties\u2019 intellectual property. As a result, Microbot may be required to incur substantial costs to prosecute, enforce or defend its intellectual property rights if they are challenged. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on Microbot\u2019s business, financial condition and resources or results of operations.\nMicrobot has the first right, but not the obligation, to control the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the licensed patents from TRDF. However, there may be situations in which Microbot will not have control over the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the patents that Microbot licenses, or may not have sufficient ability to consult and input into the patent prosecution and maintenance process with respect to such patents. If Microbot does not control the patent prosecution and maintenance process with respect to the TRDF licensed patents, TRDF may elect to do so but may fail to take the steps that are necessary or desirable in order to obtain, maintain and enforce the licensed patents.\nMicrobot\u2019s ability to develop intellectual property depends in large part on hiring, retaining and motivating highly qualified design and engineering staff and consultants with the knowledge and technical competence to advance its technology and productivity goals. To protect Microbot\u2019s trade secrets and proprietary information, Microbot has entered into confidentiality agreements with its employees, as well as with consultants and other parties. If these agreements prove inadequate or are breached, Microbot\u2019s remedies may not be sufficient to cover its losses.\nDependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may result in Microbot\u2019s payment of significant monetary damages or impact offerings in its product portfolios.\nMicrobot\u2019s long-term success largely depends on its ability to market technologically competitive product candidates. If Microbot fails to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, it may not be able to prevent third parties from using its proprietary technologies or may lose access to technologies critical to our product candidates. Also, Microbot currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, and issued patents are subject to claims concerning priority, scope and other issues.\nFurthermore, Microbot has not filed applications for all of our patents internationally and it may not be able to prevent third parties from using its proprietary technologies or may lose access to technologies critical to its product candidates in other countries.\nRisks Relating to Operations in Israel\nMicrobot has facilities located in Israel, and therefore, political conditions in Israel may affect Microbot\u2019s operations and results.\nMicrobot has facilities located in Israel. In addition, three of its seven directors (one of whom is also its Chief Operating Officer) and its Chief Financial Officer, are residents of Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel will directly or indirectly affect Microbot\u2019s operations and results. Since the establishment of the State of Israel, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. An ongoing state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic problems for Israel. For a number of years there have been continuing hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians. This includes hostilities with the Islamic movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which have adversely affected the peace process and at times resulted in armed conflicts. Such hostilities have negatively influenced Israel\u2019s economy as well as impaired Israel\u2019s relationships with several other countries. Israel also faces threats from Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, from ISIS and rebel forces in Syria, from the government of Iran and other potential threats from additional countries in the region. Moreover, some of Israel\u2019s neighboring countries have recently undergone or are undergoing significant political changes. These political, economic and military conditions in Israel could have a material adverse effect on Microbot\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth.\nPolitical relations could limit Microbot\u2019s ability to sell or buy internationally.\nMicrobot could be adversely affected by the interruption or reduction of trade between Israel and its trading partners. Some countries, companies and organizations continue to participate in a boycott of Israeli firms and others doing business with Israel, with Israeli companies or with Israeli-owned companies operating in other countries. Foreign government defense export policies towards Israel could also make it more difficult for us to obtain the export authorizations necessary for Microbot\u2019s activities. Also, over the past several years there have been calls in the United States, Europe and elsewhere to reduce trade with Israel. There can be no assurance that restrictive laws, policies or practices directed towards Israel or Israeli businesses will not have an adverse impact on Microbot\u2019s business.\nIsrael\u2019s economy may become unstable.\nFrom time to time, Israel\u2019s economy may experience inflation or deflation, low foreign exchange reserves, fluctuations in world commodity prices, military conflicts and civil unrest. For these and other reasons, the government of Israel has intervened in the economy employing fiscal and monetary policies, import duties, foreign currency restrictions, controls of wages, prices and foreign currency exchange rates and regulations regarding the lending limits of Israeli banks to companies considered to be in an affiliated group. The Israeli government has periodically changed its policies in these areas. Reoccurrence of previous destabilizing factors could make it more difficult for Microbot to operate its business and could adversely affect its business.\nExchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the NIS currencies may negatively affect Microbot\u2019s operating costs.\nA significant portion of Microbot\u2019s expenses are paid in New Israeli Shekels, or NIS, but its financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, Microbot is exposed to the risks that the NIS may appreciate relative to the U.S. dollar, or the NIS instead devalues relative to the U.S. dollar, and the inflation rate in Israel may exceed such rate of devaluation of the NIS, or that the timing of such devaluation may lag behind inflation in Israel. In any such event, the U.S. dollar cost of Microbot\u2019s operations in Israel would increase and Microbot\u2019s U.S. dollar-denominated results of operations would be adversely affected. Microbot cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation in Israel or the rate of devaluation (if any) of the NIS against the U.S. dollar.\nMicrobot\u2019s primary expenses paid in NIS that are not linked to the U.S. dollar are employee expenses in Israel and lease payments on its Israeli facility. If Microbot is unsuccessful in hedging against its position in NIS, a change in the value of the NIS compared to the U.S. dollar could increase Microbot\u2019s research and development expenses, labor costs and general and administrative expenses, and as a result, have a negative impact on Microbot\u2019s profits.\nFunding and other benefits provided by Israeli government programs may be terminated or reduced in the future and the terms of such funding may have a significant impact on future corporate decisions.\nMicrobot participates in programs under the auspices of the Israeli Innovation Authority, for which it receives funding for the development of its technologies and product candidates. If Microbot fails to comply with the conditions applicable to this program, it may be required to pay additional penalties or make refunds and may be denied future benefits. From time to time, the government of Israel has discussed reducing or eliminating the benefits available under this program, and therefore these benefits may not be available in the future at their current levels or at all.\nMicrobot\u2019s research and development efforts from inception until now have been financed in part through such Israeli Innovation Authority royalty bearing grants in an aggregate amount of approximately $1,500,000 through December 31, 2019. With respect to such grants Microbot is committed to pay royalties at a rate of between 3% to 3.5% on sales proceeds up to the total amount of grants received, linked to the dollar, plus interest at an annual rate of USD LIBOR. In addition, as a recipient of Israeli Innovation Authority grants, Microbot must comply with the requirements of the Israeli Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development Law, 1984, or the R&D Law, and related regulations. Under the terms of the grants and the R&D Law, Microbot is restricted from transferring any technologies, know-how, manufacturing or manufacturing rights developed using Israeli Innovation Authority grants outside of Israel without the prior approval of Israeli Innovation Authority. Therefore, if aspects of its technologies are deemed to have been developed with Israeli Innovation Authority funding, the discretionary approval of an Israeli Innovation Authority committee would be required for any transfer to third parties outside of Israel of the technologies, know-how, manufacturing or manufacturing rights related to such aspects. Furthermore, the Israeli Innovation Authority may impose certain conditions on any arrangement under which it permits Microbot to transfer technology or development outside of Israel or may not grant such approvals at all.\nIf approved, the transfer of Israeli Innovation Authority-supported technology or know-how outside of Israel may involve the payment of significant fees, which will depend on the value of the transferred technology or know-how, the total amount Israeli Innovation Authority funding received by Microbot, the number of years since the funding and other factors. These restrictions and requirements for payment may impair Microbot\u2019s ability to sell its technology assets outside of Israel or to outsource or transfer development or manufacturing activities with respect to any product or technology outside of Israel. Furthermore, the amount of consideration available to Microbot\u2019s shareholders in a transaction involving the transfer of technology or know-how developed with Israeli Innovation Authority funding outside of Israel (such as through a merger or other similar transaction) may be reduced by any amounts that Microbot is required to pay to the Israeli Innovation Authority.\nSome of Microbot\u2019s employees and officers are obligated to perform military reserve duty in Israel.\nGenerally, Israeli adult male citizens and permanent residents are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty up to a specified age. They also may be called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances, which could have a disruptive impact on Microbot\u2019s workforce.\nIt may be difficult to enforce a non-Israeli judgment against Microbot or its officers and directors.\nThe operating subsidiary of the Company is incorporated in Israel. Some of Microbot\u2019s executive officers and directors are not residents of the United States, and a substantial portion of Microbot\u2019s assets and the assets of its executive officers and directors are located outside the United States. Therefore, a judgment obtained against Microbot, or any of these persons, including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States and may not necessarily be enforced by an Israeli court. It also may be difficult to affect service of process on these persons in the United States or to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Additionally, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to initiate an action with respect to U.S. securities laws in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of U.S. securities laws reasoning that Israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law often involves the testimony of expert witnesses, which can be a time consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel that addresses the matters described above. As a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against Microbot in Israel, it may be impossible to collect any damages awarded by either a U.S. or foreign court.\nRisks Relating to Microbot\u2019s Securities, Governance and Other Matters\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the applicable listing standards. In 2018, we effected a 1:15 reverse stock split to address our stock price falling below the minimum share price required by Nasdaq. Failure to meet applicable Nasdaq continued listing standards could result in a delisting of our common stock. A delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, employees and fewer business opportunities. Additionally, if we are not eligible for quotation or listing on another exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe anticipate that we will retain our earnings, if any, for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our Common Stock in the future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our Common Stock for that purpose.\nAnti-takeover provisions in the Company\u2019s charter and bylaws under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to change the board of directors or current management and could make a third-party acquisition of the Company difficult.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition or a change in management. These provisions include a classified board of directors. In addition, because the Company is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with the Company. Although the Company believes these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the Company\u2019s board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by the Company\u2019s stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing members of management.\nThe market price for our Common Stock may be volatile.\nThe market price for our Common Stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial or operational estimates or projections;\n\u25cf conditions in markets generally;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies similar to ours;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf our intellectual property position; and\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions in the United States, Israel or elsewhere.\nIn addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of shares of our Common Stock.\nThe issuance of shares upon exercise of outstanding warrants and options could cause immediate and substantial dilution to existing stockholders.\nThe issuance of shares upon exercise of warrants and options could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders since the holders of such securities may ultimately convert and sell the full amount issuable on conversion.\nWe are subject to litigation, which may divert management\u2019s attention and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe recently lost our appeal of an adverse judgment in the lawsuit captioned Sabby Healthcare Master Fund Ltd. and Sabby Volatility Warrant Master Fund Ltd., Plaintiffs, against Microbot Medical Inc., Defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (Index No. 654581/2017). As a result, the Securities Purchase Agreement (the \u201cSPA\u201d) related to our June 8, 2017 equity financing (the \u201cFinancing\u201d) was rescinded as it related to the Sabby plaintiffs, and we paid approximately $3.7 million and the Sabby Plaintiffs returned 83,333 (post-stock split) shares of common stock they purchased from us pursuant to the SPA. Soon after, we were named as the defendant in a lawsuit captioned Empery Asset Master Ltd., Empery Tax Efficient, LP, Empery Tax Efficient II, LP, Hudson Bay Master Fund Ltd., Plaintiffs, against Microbot Medical Inc., Defendant, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the \u201cCourt\u201d) (Index No. 651182/2020). The complaint alleged, among other things, that we breached multiple representations and warranties contained in the SPA, of which the Plaintiffs participated. The complaint sought rescission of the SPA and return of the Plaintiffs\u2019 $6.75 million purchase price with respect to the Financing. We filed a Motion to Dismiss on March 16, 2020, which Motion is pending before the Court.\nAs a result of the adverse outcome with respect to the Sabby litigation, management is unable to assess the likelihood that we would be successful in the Motion to Dismiss, or of any trial if we lose the Motion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that if we lose the Motion and we go to trial and ultimately lose, or if we decide to settle at any time, such an adverse outcome would not be material to our consolidated financial position. Additionally, in any such case, we will likely be required to use the proceeds from recent offerings or available cash towards the rescission or settlement, that we otherwise would have used to build our business and develop our technologies into commercial products. In such event, we would be required to raise additional capital sooner than we otherwise would, of which we can give no assurance of success, or delay, curtail or cease the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.", "PERMNO": 77437, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "MBOT"}
