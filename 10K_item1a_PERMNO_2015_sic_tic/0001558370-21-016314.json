{"cik": "933974", "company": "Brooks Automation, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-11-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFactors That May Affect Future Results\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Form 10-K before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. These are the risks and uncertainties applicable to our businesses, including our semiconductor automation business, that we believe are most important for you to consider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results would likely suffer. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the COVID-1 pandemic.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19, was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and commerce in the months that followed. Since then, COVID-19 has spread worldwide, including in the United States, and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. We have followed the guidelines from the U.S. Center for Disease Control, or CDC, and implemented the recommended safety protocols, and the spread of COVID-19 has also caused us to modify our business practices (including curtailing employee travel, implementing vaccination and testing policies and extending work-from-home policies where necessary), and we may take further actions as required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures designed to contain its spread, our suppliers may not have the materials, capacity, or capability to supply our components according to our schedule and specifications. Further, there may be logistics issues, including our ability and our supply chain\u2019s ability to maintain production, as well as transportation demands that may cause further delays. If our suppliers\u2019 operations are curtailed, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply, which may be more expensive. Alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us from our suppliers and subsequently to our customers. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures designed to stop the spread of the virus may have similar effects on our customers. The current pandemic may also give rise to force majeure contractual protections being asserted by customers and/or suppliers that we maintain contracts with, potentially relieving contractual obligations these parties have to us. In any case, any disruption of our suppliers\u2019 or customers\u2019 businesses would likely negatively impact our sales and operating results.\nWhile the disruptions and restrictions on the ability to travel, quarantines and other measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to be temporary, the duration of any of these measures, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. Should these measures continue for an extended period of time or be re-implemented after, the impact on our supply chain and customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, while the potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular may be difficult to assess or predict, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets and an economic downturn that may affect demand for our\nproducts and services, reduce our ability to access capital or our customers\u2019 ability to pay us for past or future purchases, impact our operating results, and have a negative impact on our liquidity and stock price. In addition, an extended recession or an additional financial market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could, adversely affect demand for our products and services, our business and the value of our common stock. The global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. Although the magnitude of the impact of the pandemic on our business and operations remains uncertain, the continued spread of COVID-19 and actions taken to mitigate such spread as well as the prolonged nature of the pandemic or the occurrence of other outbreaks of contagious diseases could adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to the Sale of our Semiconductor Automation Business\nThe announcement and pendency of the sale of our semiconductor automation business to Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. could have an adverse effect on our stock price and/or our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe announcement and pendency of the sale of our semiconductor automation business to Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P., or THL, pursuant to the equity interest purchase agreement we entered into on September 20, 2021 could disrupt our business in the following ways, among others:\n\u25cf customers may determine to delay or defer purchase decisions with regard to our semiconductor products and services or terminate and/or attempt to renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the pending sale, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or otherwise;\n\u25cf investors and customers may perceive that the loss of annual revenue generated by our semiconductor automation business, which was $680.1 million in fiscal year 2021, will negatively impact our growth potential and future financial results; and\n\u25cf the attention of our management may be directed toward the completion of the pending sale and related matters, and their focus may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of our company, including from other opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us.\nShould any of these matters occur, they could adversely affect our stock price or harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nObtaining required approvals necessary to satisfy the conditions to the completion of the sale of our semiconductor automation business may delay or prevent completion of the pending sale.\nThe completion of the sale of our semiconductor automation business to THL is conditioned upon obtaining certain regulatory approvals. We intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the terms of the equity interest purchase agreement. No assurance, however, can be given that the required approvals will be obtained and, even if all such approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or that the approvals will satisfy the terms of the equity interest purchase agreement.\nInability to complete the sale of our semiconductor automation business could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or our stock price.\nThe completion of the sale of our semiconductor automation business to THL is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and there not having been a material adverse effect with respect to such business, and there can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the pending sale will be satisfied. The equity interest purchase agreement may also be terminated by us and/or THL in certain specified circumstances, including in certain circumstances if the sale has not been consummated by June 30, 2022. While the potential sale is pending and if the pending sale is not completed, we will be subject to several risks, including:\n\u25cf the current trading price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the sale will be completed;\n\u25cf we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial transaction costs in connection with the pending sale whether or not it is completed;\n\u25cf under the equity interest purchase agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the pending sale, which restrictions could adversely affect our ability to realize certain of our business strategies or take advantage of certain business opportunities;\n\u25cf the negative perception of investors and customers of our semiconductor automation business if the sale is not consummated and our inability to operate the business in the same manner as before the announcement of the proposed sale\n\u25cf the failure to receive the purchase price from the sale and our inability to use these funds as expected to expand our life sciences businesses; and\n\u25cf the risks inherent and specific to the semiconductor automation business, including the historical cyclicality in demand for semiconductor capital equipment, the critical importance of supply chain stability, and potential international trade restrictions and other geopolitical risks.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nOur operating results could fluctuate significantly, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur revenue, operating margins and other operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year depending upon a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf changes in the timing and terms of product orders and service contracts by our customers as a result of our customer concentration or otherwise;\n\u25cf changes in the demand for the mix of products and services that we offer;\n\u25cf timing and market acceptance of our new product and services introductions;\n\u25cf delays or problems in the planned introduction of new products or services, or in the performance of any such products following delivery to customers or the quality of such services;\n\u25cf new products, services or technological innovations by our competitors, which can, among other things, render our products and services less competitive due to the rapid technological changes in the markets in which we provide products and services;\n\u25cf the timing and related costs of any acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions;\n\u25cf our ability to reduce our costs in response to decreased demand for our products and services;\n\u25cf our ability to accurately estimate customer demand, including the accuracy of demand forecasts used by us;\n\u25cf disruptions in our manufacturing process or in the supply of components to us;\n\u25cf write-offs for excess or obsolete inventory;\n\u25cf competitive pricing pressures; and\n\u25cf increased amount of investment into the infrastructure to support our growth, including capital equipment, research and development, as well as selling and marketing initiatives to support continuous product and services innovation, technological capability enhancements and sales efforts. The timing of revenue generation coupled with the increased amount of investment may result in operating losses.\nAs a result of these risks, we believe that reference to past performance for comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance.\nIf we do not continue to introduce new products and services that reflect advances in technology in a timely and effective manner, our products and services may become obsolete and our operating results will suffer.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to respond to the technological changes present in the markets we serve. The success of our product development and introduction of products and services to market depends on our ability to:\n\u25cf identify and define new market opportunities, products and services in an accurate manner;\n\u25cf obtain market acceptance of our products and services;\n\u25cf innovate, develop, acquire and commercialize new technologies and applications in a timely manner;\n\u25cf adjust to changing market conditions;\n\u25cf differentiate our offerings from our competitors\u2019 offerings;\n\u25cf obtain and maintain intellectual property rights where necessary;\n\u25cf continue to develop a comprehensive, integrated product and service strategy;\n\u25cf price our products and services appropriately; and\n\u25cf design our products to high standards of manufacturability so that they meet customer requirements.\nIf we cannot succeed in responding in a timely manner to technological and/or market changes or if the new products and services that we introduce do not achieve market acceptance, our competitive position would diminish which could materially harm our business and our prospects.\nThe global nature of our business exposes us to multiple risks.\nDuring fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately 38%, 34% and 32% of our revenue was derived from sales outside of North America. We expect that international sales, including increased sales in Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future, and that in particular, the proportion of our sales to customers in China will continue to increase, due in large part to our significant genomic services operation in China. Additionally, we intend to invest additional resources in facilities in China, which will increase our global footprint of sales, service and repair operations. As a result of our international operations, we are exposed to many risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf longer sales-cycles and time to collection;\n\u25cf tariff and international trade barriers;\n\u25cf fewer or less certain legal protections for intellectual property and contract rights abroad;\n\u25cf different and changing legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u25cf government currency control and restrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u25cf a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;\n\u25cf fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, particularly in Asia and Europe; and\n\u25cf political and economic instability, changes, hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we operate.\nNegative developments in any of these areas in one or more countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting receivables, and a higher cost of doing business, any of which could materially harm our business and profitability.\nOur business could be materially harmed if we fail to adequately integrate the operations of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire.\nWe have made in the past, and may make in the future, acquisitions or significant investments in businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. Our acquisitions, present numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses;\n\u25cf defining and executing a comprehensive product strategy;\n\u25cf managing the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited or no direct experience;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of ours or of acquired companies;\n\u25cf unanticipated problems or latent liabilities, such as problems with the quality of the installed base of the target company\u2019s products or infringement of another company\u2019s intellectual property by a target company\u2019s activities or products;\n\u25cf problems associated with compliance with the acquired company\u2019s existing contracts;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations; and\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business.\nIf we acquire a new business, we may expend significant funds, incur additional debt or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our operations and be dilutive to our stockholders. In periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings. The failure to adequately address these risks or the impairment of any assets could materially harm our business and financial results.\nThe possibility of these risks impacting our business will likely expand after the expected completion of the sale our semiconductor automation businesses.\nExpanding within current markets introduces new competitors and commercial risks.\nA key part of our growth strategy is to continue expanding within the life sciences sample management and genomic services markets. As part of this strategy, we expect to diversify our product sales and service revenue by leveraging our core technologies, which requires investments and resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all when needed. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in leveraging our capabilities into the life sciences sample management and genomic services markets to meet all the needs of new customers and to compete favorably. Because a significant portion of our growth potential may be dependent on our ability to increase sales within each of the Life Sciences Product and Life Sciences Services segments, our inability to successfully expand within the markets serviced by these segments may adversely impact future financial results.\nChanges in key personnel could impair our ability to execute our business strategy.\nThe continuing service of our executive officers and essential engineering, scientific and management personnel, together with our ability to attract and retain such personnel, is an important factor in our continuing ability to execute our strategy. There is substantial competition to attract such employees and the loss of any such key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. The same could be true if we were to experience a high turnover rate among engineering and scientific personnel and we were unable to replace them.\nGlobal climate change and related legal and regulatory developments could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change presents immediate and long-term risks to us and to our customers, with the risks expected to increase over time. Our products and services are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations. Future regulations or voluntary actions on our part in response to climate change could result in costly changes to our facilities to reduce carbon emissions and could increase energy costs as a result of switching to less carbon-intensive, but more expensive, sources of energy to operate our facilities and to transport and ship products and samples. There can be no assurance that climate change or environmental regulation and response will not have a negative competitive impact on our ability to provide sample management, automated storage, and genomic services or that economic returns will match the investment that we are making in the development of new products and services. We will likely face increasing complexity related to product design, the use of regulated materials, energy consumption and efficiency, and the reuse, recycling, or disposal of products and their components at end-of-use or useful life. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty regarding future incentives for energy-efficiency and costs of compliance, which may impact the demand for our products and services, and our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in global weather patterns, which could include local changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels, and changing temperature averages or extremes. These impacts may also adversely affect our properties, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnexpected events could disrupt our sample storage operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nUnexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Our Life Sciences Services customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve and transport their critical samples, and these events could result in service disruptions, physical damage to one or more key storage facilities and the customer samples stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of service, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. Our primary storage facility is located in Indianapolis, Indiana, an area of the United States that can be prone to tornadoes and other severe weather events.\nIf our facilities were to experience a significant disruption in operations, our business could be materially harmed, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.\nWe have a limited number of manufacturing facilities for our products and laboratories for our service offerings. If the operations at any one of these facilities were disrupted as a result of a natural disaster, fire, power or other utility outage, work stoppage or other similar event, our business could be seriously harmed because we may be unable to manufacture and ship products and parts, or provide services, to our customers in a timely fashion. The impact of any disruption at one of our facilities may be exacerbated if the disruption occurs at a time when we need to rapidly increase our capabilities to meet increased demand or expedited shipment schedules.\nMoreover, if actual demand for our products or services is different than expected, we may purchase more/fewer component parts or other supplies than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of such parts or supplies. If we purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if our customers reduce or delay orders, we may incur excess inventory charges. Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business relies on certain critical information systems and a failure or breach of such a system could harm our business and results of operations and, in the event of unauthorized access to a customer\u2019s data or our data, incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nWe maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications and e-mail. These information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsource providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors. These information systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines and networking equipment. To the extent that these information systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to mitigate the outlined risks. However, security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, or unauthorized releases of confidential information, could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business.\nConfidential information stored on these information systems could also be compromised. If a third party gains unauthorized access to our data, including any information regarding our customers, such security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third parties may fraudulently attempt to induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.\nOur goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had $469.4 million of goodwill and $453.2 million in net intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions. We periodically review our goodwill and the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value, or for intangible assets, a revised useful life. These events and circumstances include significant changes in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, advances in technology and competition. Any impairment or revised useful life could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and could harm the trading price of our common stock.\nChanges in tax rates or tax regulation could affect results of operations.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Our future annual and quarterly effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the following: applicable tax laws; composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; and/or establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets based on the assessment of their realizability prior to expiration. Changes in applicable tax laws could significantly impact the estimates of our tax assets and liabilities, as well as expectations of future effective tax rates. Recently proposed U.S. corporate income tax reform could drive negative impacts to our tax position depending upon final enacted legislation. Based on the nature of the uncertainties around specific legislation to be agreed-upon by congress, we have not quantified the impact of this risk. In addition, we are subject to regular examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nInternational trade disputes could result in additional or increased tariffs, export controls or other trade restrictions that may have a material impact on our business.\nWe sell a significant number of products outside the United States, including in China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. Based on the complex relationships among these countries and the United States, there is inherent risk that political, diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular, with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Increases in tariffs, additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may increasingly impact customer demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations, including environmental regulations, regulations relating to the design and operation of our products and control systems and regulations relating to certain of our service offerings. We might incur significant costs as we seek to ensure that our products meet safety and emissions standards, many of which vary across the states and countries in which our products are used. In the past, we have invested significant resources to redesign our products to comply with these directives. Compliance with future regulations, directives, and standards could require us to modify or redesign some products, change our service offerings, make capital expenditures, or incur substantial costs. If we do not comply with current or future regulations, directives, and standards:\n\u25cf we could be subject to fines;\n\u25cf our production or shipments could be suspended; and\n\u25cf we could be prohibited from offering particular products or services in specified markets.\nAny of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations and customer demands related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use in components of our products of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, whether the components of our products are manufactured by us or third parties. This requirement could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products. In addition, there are additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements and customer requests, such as costs related to our due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. We may face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free and/or free of numerous other hazardous materials.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations may lead to lower operating margins, or may cause us to raise prices, which could result in reduced sales.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales, cost of sales and results of operations, and we could experience losses with respect to forward exchange contracts into which we may enter. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products and services in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, most sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold or these services are provided and the currency they receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable as compared to the U.S. dollar at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. From time to time, we enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce currency exposure. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to\nprotect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, generate cash flows and make payments on such indebtedness\nOn October 4, 2017, we entered into a $200.0 million Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, or term loan, with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC pursuant to the terms of a credit agreement with the lenders. At September 30, 2021, the outstanding term loan principal balance was $49.7 million, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.3 million. The term loan matures and becomes fully payable on October 4, 2024. We are required to redeem the term loan at the principal amount then outstanding upon occurrence of certain events, as described in the credit agreement. For further information on this transaction, please refer to Note 11, \"Debt\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nOur ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness, including the term loan, is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and maintain sufficient liquidity to service such debt. The loan borrowings are subject to variable interest rates which create exposure to interest rate risk. Interest rate increases may result in higher cost of servicing our loans and reduce our profitability and cash flows. The terms of our debt covenants in the credit agreement for the term loan could limit our ability to raise additional funds and the manner in which we conduct our business. We have the ability to refinance the term loan and obtain additional indebtedness as long as we maintain a certain level of liquidity and earnings, as specified in the credit agreement for the term loan. If our liquidity and earnings are reduced below a certain level, we will have limited ability to service the term loan and obtain additional debt financing. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under the term loan and our other indebtedness could also result in an event of default under the term loan which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of our indebtedness, including under the term loan. Accordingly, a default under the term loan would have a material adverse effect on our business and our lender would have the right to exercise its rights and remedies to collect, which would include the right to foreclose on our assets.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future operations.\nOur ability to compete is significantly affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely upon patents, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, copyrights, trademarks and licensing agreements to protect our technology. Existing trade secret, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products and technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured, or sold may not fully protect our products. Due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the life sciences and related process equipment industries, we believe that the improvement of existing technology, reliance upon trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and the development of new products may be as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. To protect trade secrets and know-how, it is our policy to require all technical and management personnel to enter into nondisclosure agreements.\nWe cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our technology. Other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our intellectual property rights. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to incur significant expenses and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations.\nThe expiration of our patents over time could lead to an increase of competition and a decline in our revenue.\nOne of our main competitive strengths is our technology, and we are dependent on our patent rights and other intellectual property rights to maintain our competitive position. Our current patents will expire from time to time through 2038 which could result in increased competition and declines in product and service revenue.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology.\nThere has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the industries in which we do business. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties. We cannot guarantee that infringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification by customers or end-users of our products and services resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions, whether or not proven to be true, will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which we might be required to seek licenses or alter our products or services so that they no longer infringe the rights of others. We also cannot guarantee that licenses will be available or the terms of any licenses we may be required to obtain will be reasonable. Similarly, changing our products, services or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical and could detract from the value of our products and services. If a judgment of infringement were obtained against us, we could be required to pay substantial damages and a court could issue an order preventing us from selling one or more of our products or offering certain of our services. Further, the cost and diversion of management attention brought about by such litigation could be substantial, even if we were to prevail. Any of these events could result in significant expense to us and may materially harm our business and our prospects.\nRisks Related to Reliance on Third Parties\nOur business could be materially harmed if one or more key suppliers fail to continuously deliver key components of acceptable cost and quality.\nWe currently obtain many of our key components on an as-needed, purchase order basis from numerous suppliers. In some cases, we have only a single source of supply for key components and materials used in the manufacturing of our products. Further, a portion of our supply is sourced from Asia, including China and we do not always have a previous history of dealing with these suppliers. Our inability to obtain components or materials in required quantities or of acceptable cost and quality and with the necessary continuity of supply could result in delays or reductions in product shipments to our customers. In addition, if a supplier or sub-supplier suffers a production stoppage or delay for any reason, including natural disasters such as the tsunamis that affected Japan in 2011 and Thailand in 2004, this could result in a delay or reduction in our product shipments to our customers. Any of these contingencies could cause us to lose customers, result in delayed or lost revenue and otherwise materially harm our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a decline in the availability of raw materials.\nWe are dependent on the availability of certain key raw materials and natural resources used in our products and various manufacturing processes, and we rely on third parties to supply us with these materials in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to raw materials may be adversely affected if our suppliers\u2019 operations were disrupted as a result of limited or delayed access to key raw materials and natural resources which may result in increased cost of these items.\nOur outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect.\nOutsource providers have played and will continue to play a key role in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology and facilities management. Many of these outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ cloud computing technology for such storage. These providers\u2019 cloud computing systems may be susceptible to \u201ccyber incidents,\u201d such as intentional cyber-attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cyber-security compromises,\nwhich are outside of our control. Although we attempt to select reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform or adequately protect our data from cyber-related security breaches as we expect and any such failure could have an adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Customers\nBecause we rely on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenue, the loss of one or more of these customers could materially harm our business.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenue in each fiscal period from a relatively limited number of customers, and that trend is likely to continue. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 19%, 19% and 21%, respectively, of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The loss of one or more of these major customers, a significant decrease in orders from one of these customers, or the inability of one or more customers to make payments to us when they are due could materially affect our revenue, business and reputation.\nBecause of the lengthy sales cycles of many of our products, we may incur significant expenses before we generate any revenue related to those products.\nOur customers may need several months to test and evaluate our products. This increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel an order or change its plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. The impact of this risk can be magnified during the periods in which we introduce a number of new products and services, as has been the case in recent years. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenue for these products, and we may never generate the anticipated revenue if our customer cancels an order or changes its plans.\nCustomers generally do not make long term commitments to purchase our products and our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time.\nSales of our products are often made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term commitments and contracts. Our customers frequently do not provide any assurance of minimum or future sales and are not prohibited from purchasing products from our competitors at any time. Accordingly, we are exposed to competitive pricing pressures on each order. Our customers also engage in the practice of purchasing products from more than one manufacturer to avoid dependence on sole-source suppliers for certain of their needs. The existence of these practices makes it more difficult for us to increase price, gain new customers and win repeat business from existing customers.\nWe may face claims for liability related to damages of customer materials attributed to the failure of our products or services, exposing us to significant financial or reputational harm.\nOur automated cold storage systems for the life sciences sample management market are used in the handling, movement and storage of biological and chemical samples. We also provide sample storage services to customers where we store their biological and chemical samples or perform genomics services at our facilities. In any case, inaccurate or faulty testing services or damage to our customers\u2019 materials attributed to a failure of our products or services could lead to claims for damages made by our customers and could also harm our relationship with our customers and damage our reputation, resulting in material harm to our business.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Securities\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely. From the beginning of fiscal year 2020 through the end of fiscal year 2021, our stock price fluctuated between a high of $109.17 per share and a low of $46.70 per share. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may\nbe unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Factors affecting our stock price may include:\n\u25cf variations in operating results from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u25cf changes in the market price per share of our public company customers;\n\u25cf market conditions in the semiconductor, life sciences sample management and genomic services and other industries into which we sell products and services;\n\u25cf global economic conditions;\n\u25cf political changes, hostilities, the COVID-19 pandemic or similar events, or natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods;\n\u25cf low trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf the change in stockholders expected upon the completion of the sale of our semiconductor automation business; and\n\u25cf the number of firms making a market in our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market has in the past experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us, which could decrease the value of your shares.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent, the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and the potential for super majority votes of our stockholders in certain circumstances. In addition, as discussed below, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation makes us subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits publicly held Delaware corporations to which it applies from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could discourage others from bidding for our shares of common stock and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in the price of our common stock that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our common stock.\nAlthough we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by stockholders. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors is authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion\nrights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences. Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Our issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. Our issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 81241, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "BRKS"}
