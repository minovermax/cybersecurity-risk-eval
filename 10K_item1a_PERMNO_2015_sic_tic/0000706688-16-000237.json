{"cik": "706688", "company": "AARON'S INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAaron\u2019s business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face, but represent the risks that we believe are material. However, there may be additional risks that we currently consider not to be material or of which we are not currently aware, and any of these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results.\nWe may be subject to new or additional federal and state financial services and consumer protection laws and regulations (or changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations) that could expose us to government investigations, significant compliance costs or burdens or force us to change our business practices in a manner that may be materially adverse to our operations, prospects or financial condition.\nCurrently, nearly every state, the District of Columbia, and most provinces in Canada specifically regulate lease-to-own transactions. This includes states in which we currently operate Aaron\u2019s Sales & Lease Ownership stores, as well as states in which our Progressive business has retail partners. While no federal law currently specifically regulates the lease-to-own industry, federal legislation to regulate the industry has been proposed in the past and may be proposed in the future. For example, federal and regulatory authorities such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \"CFPB\") and the FTC are increasingly focused on the subprime financial marketplace in which the lease-to-own industry operates, and may propose and adopt new legislation (or interpret existing regulations) that could result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for businesses such as ours. Furthermore, our debt collections practices are subject to federal and state laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly. For example, with increasing frequency, federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training, monitoring and compliance. Failure by us or those businesses to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could result in fines, penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our business, or federal or state actions, or private litigation, any of which could significantly harm our reputation with consumers and Progressive\u2019s and DAMI\u2019s retail and merchant partners and could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nThe risks in Progressive\u2019s virtual lease-to-own business differ in some potentially significant respects from the risks of Aaron\u2019s store-based lease-to-own business. These risks, whether arising from the offer by third party retailers of Progressive\u2019s lease-purchase solution alongside traditional cash, check or credit payment options or otherwise, may also be materially adverse to our operations, prospects or financial condition. Furthermore, Progressive\u2019s business relies on third party retailers (over whom Progressive cannot exercise the degree of control and oversight that Aaron\u2019s and its franchisees can assert over their own respective employees) for many important business functions, from advertising through assistance with lease transaction applications. Accordingly, there is the potential that regulators may target virtual lease-to-own transactions and/or implement new legislation (or interpret existing regulations) that could negatively impact Progressive\u2019s ability to offer virtual lease-to-own programs through third party retail partners.\nIn addition, as we execute on our strategic plans, we may continue to expand into complementary businesses, such as DAMI, that engage in financial, banking or lending services that are subject to a variety of statutes and regulatory requirements in addition to those regulations currently applicable to our legacy operations, which may impose significant costs, limitations or prohibitions on the manner in which we currently conduct our businesses as well as those we may acquire in the future. Any additional laws or regulations may result in changes in the way our operations are regulated, exposing us to increased regulatory oversight, more burdensome regulations and increased litigation risk, each of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAny proposed rulemaking by the CFPB, the FTC or any other federal or state regulators or other adverse changes in (or interpretations of) existing laws and regulations, the passage of new adverse legislation or regulations by the federal government or the states applicable to our traditional lease-to-own business, our Progressive virtual lease-to-own business, our Aarons.com e-commerce business and any complementary businesses into which we may expand could materially increase both our compliance costs and the risk that we could be subject to government investigations and subject to sanctions if we are not in compliance. In addition, new burdensome laws or regulations could force us to modify our business model, expose us to increased litigation risk, and might reduce the economic potential of our sales and lease ownership operations.\nProgressive\u2019s virtual lease-to-own business differs in some potentially significant respects from the risks of Aaron\u2019s store-based lease-to-own business. The risks could have a material negative effect on Progressive, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business.\nAs discussed above, our Progressive segment offers its lease-to-own solution through the stores of third party retailers. Progressive consequently faces some different risks than are associated with Aaron\u2019s sales and lease ownership concept, which Aaron\u2019s and its franchisees offer through their own stores. These potential risks include, among others, Progressive\u2019s:\n\u2022\nreliance on third party retailers (over whom Progressive cannot exercise the degree of control and oversight that Aaron\u2019s and its franchisees can assert over their own respective employees) for many important business functions, from advertising through assistance with lease transaction applications;\n\u2022\nrevenue concentration in the customers of a relatively small number of retailers, as further discussed below;\n\u2022\nlack of control over, and more product diversity within, its lease merchandise inventory relative to Aaron\u2019s sale and lease ownership business, which can complicate matters such as merchandise repair and disposition of merchandise that is returned;\n\u2022\npossibly different regulatory risks than apply to Aaron\u2019s sales and lease ownership business, whether arising from the offer by third party retailers of Progressive\u2019s lease-purchase solution alongside traditional cash, check or credit payment options or otherwise;\n\u2022\nreliance on automatic bank account drafts for lease payments, which may become disfavored as a payment method for these transactions by regulators;\n\u2022\npotential that regulators may target the virtual lease-to-own transaction and/or new regulations or legislation could be adopted (or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted) that negatively impact Progressive\u2019s ability to offer virtual lease-to-own programs through third party retail partners; and\n\u2022\nindemnification obligations to Progressive\u2019s retail partners and their service providers for losses stemming from Progressive\u2019s failure to perform with respect to its products and services.\nThese risks could have a material negative effect on Progressive, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business.\nWe continue to implement a new strategic plan and there is no guarantee that the new strategic plan will produce results superior to those achieved under the Company\u2019s prior plan.\nWe have a new strategic plan that, in addition to acquiring Progressive in 2014, includes focusing on profitably growing our stores; accelerating our omni-channel platform; promoting communication, coordination and integration; and championing compliance.\nWhile we have always engaged in elements of the new strategy, the new strategy calls for increased emphasis on certain elements while moderating the focus on new store openings that had traditionally been a central tenet of the Company\u2019s strategy. There can be no guarantee that the new strategy will yield the results we currently anticipate (or results that will exceed those that might be obtained under the prior strategy), if we fail to successfully execute on one or more elements of the new strategy, even if we successfully implement one or more other components.\nWe may not fully execute on one or more elements of the new strategy due to any number of reasons, including, for instance, because of the division of management, financial and Company resources among multiple objectives, or other factors beyond or not completely within our control. The successful execution of our new strategy depends on, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nimprove same store revenues in stores that may be maturing;\n\u2022\ndrive recurring cost savings to recapture margin;\n\u2022\nidentify which markets are best suited for more disciplined store growth;\n\u2022\nstrengthen our franchise network; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully manage and grow our Aarons.com e-commerce platform\nIf we cannot address these challenges successfully, or overcome other critical obstacles that may emerge as we gain experience with our new strategy, we may not be able to achieve our revenue or profitability goals at the rates we currently contemplate, if at all.\nOur core business faces many challenges which could materially and adversely affect our overall results of operations.\nOur traditional lease-to-own store-based (\"core\") business faces a number of challenges, particularly from the continued expansion of digital retail - which includes a wide array of e-commerce retailers that have established far larger digital operations than our Aarons.com e-commerce platform has been able to achieve to date. Increasing competition from the digital sector may reduce the market share held by our core business as well as its operating margins, and may materially and adversely affect our overall results of operations. Furthermore, as our Progressive virtual lease-to-own solution continues to partner with traditional retailers, including \"big box\" retailers, those retailers may increasingly compete with our core business, including our franchisees. For example, our Company-operated stores experienced year to date same store revenue declines of 4.1% and 2.8% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, our franchised stores experienced year to date same store revenue declines of 0.9% and 2.5% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We calculate same store revenue growth by comparing revenues for comparable periods for stores open during the entirety of those periods. A number of factors have historically affected our same store revenues, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in competition, particularly from the digital sector;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions;\n\u2022\nconsumer trends;\n\u2022\nchanges in our merchandise mix;\n\u2022\ntiming of promotional events; and\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business strategy effectively.\nIf our core business is unable to successfully address these challenges, our overall business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected as well.\nContinuation or worsening of current economic conditions could result in decreased revenues or increased costs. The geographic concentration of our Sales & Lease Ownership stores, as well as those of Progressive\u2019s retail partners, may magnify the impact of conditions in a particular region, including economic downturns and other occurrences.\nThe U.S. economy continues to experience prolonged uncertainty. We believe that the extended duration of current economic conditions, particularly as they apply to our customer base, may be resulting in our customers curtailing entering into sales and lease ownership agreements for the types of merchandise we offer, resulting in decreased revenues. Any increases in unemployment may result in increased defaults on lease payments, resulting in increased merchandise return costs and merchandise losses.\nThe concentration of our Sales & Lease Ownership stores, and/or those of our retail partners at Progressive, in one region or a limited number of markets may expose us to risks of adverse economic developments that are greater than if our store portfolio and retail partners were more geographically diverse. For example, during 2015, approximately 18% of our core business\u2019s store-based revenues were generated in Texas. Given our concentration of stores in Texas, the downturn and prolonged uncertainty in the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our overall business.\nIn addition, our store operations, as well as those of our retail partners at Progressive, are subject to the effects of adverse acts of nature, such as winter storms, hurricanes, hail storms, strong winds, earthquakes and tornados, which have in the past caused damage such as flooding and other damage to our stores and those of our retail partners in specific geographic locations. Additionally, we cannot assure you that the amount of our hurricane, windstorm, earthquake, flood, business interruption or other casualty insurance we maintain from time to time would entirely cover damages caused by any such event.\nWe could lose our access to data sources, which could cause us competitive harm and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are heavily dependent on data provided by third party providers. For example, our Progressive business employs a proprietary decisioning algorithm when making lease approval decisions for its customers. This algorithm depends extensively upon continued access to and receipt of data from external sources, such as third party data vendors. In addition, our Aarons.com and DAMI businesses are similarly dependent on customer attribute data provided by external sources. Our data providers could stop providing data, provide untimely, incorrect or incomplete data, or increase the costs for their data for a variety of reasons, including a perception that our systems are insecure as a result of a data security breach, regulatory concerns or for competitive reasons. We could also become subject to increased legislative, regulatory or judicial restrictions or mandates on the collection, disclosure or use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by our providers in a way that allows us to legally use the data. If we were to lose access to this external data or if our access or use were restricted or were to\nbecome less economical or desirable, our Progressive, Aarons.com and DAMI businesses would be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in maintaining our relationships with these external data source providers or that we will be able to continue to obtain data from them on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable.\nProgressive\u2019s proprietary algorithm used to approve customers could no longer be indicative of our customer\u2019s ability to pay.\nWe believe Progressive\u2019s proprietary, centralized underwriting process to be a key to the success of the Progressive business. We assume behavior and attributes observed for prior customers, among other factors, are indicative of performance by future customers. Unexpected changes in behavior caused by macroeconomic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, availability of alternative products or other factors, however, could lead to increased incidence and costs related to unpaid leases and/or merchandise losses.\nProgressive\u2019s loss of operating revenues from key retail partners could materially and adversely affect our business.\nProgressive\u2019s relationship with its largest retail partners will have a significant impact on our operating revenues in future periods. The loss of any such key retailers would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of Progressive\u2019s large retail partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain consumers and other retail partners, and could lessen Progressive\u2019s negotiating power with its remaining and prospective retail partners.\nMany of Progressive\u2019s contracts with its retail partners can be terminated by them on relatively short notice, and all can be terminated in limited circumstances, such as our material breach or insolvency, our failure to meet agreed-upon service levels, certain changes in control of Progressive, and its inability or unwillingness to agree to requested pricing changes. There can be no assurance that Progressive will be able to continue its relationships with its largest retail partners on the same or more favorable terms in future periods or that its relationships will continue beyond the terms of our existing contracts with them. Our operating revenues and operating results could suffer if, among other things, any of Progressive\u2019s retail partners renegotiates, terminates or fails to renew, or fails to renew on similar or favorable terms, their agreements with Progressive or otherwise chooses to modify the level of support they provide for Progressive\u2019s lease-purchase option.\nFailure to successfully manage and grow our Aarons.com e-commerce platform could materially adversely affect our business and future prospects.\nOur Aarons.com e-commerce platform provides customers the ability to review our product offerings and prices and enter into lease agreements as well as make payments on existing leases from the comfort of their homes and on their mobile devices. Our e-commerce platform is a significant component of our strategic plan and we believe will drive future growth of our business. In order to promote our products and services and allow customers to transact online and reach new customers, we must effectively create, design, maintain, and improve our e-commerce platform. There can be no assurance that we will be able to create, design, maintain, and improve or grow our e-commerce platform in a profitable manner.\nDAMI\u2019s \"second-look\" credit programs for below-prime consumers differ in significant respects from the risks of Aaron\u2019s store-based lease-to-own business. The risks could have a material negative effect on Progressive, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business.\nAs discussed above, as we execute on our strategic plans, we may continue to expand into complementary businesses that engage in financial, banking or lending services. For example, DAMI, which through its HELPcard\u00ae and other private label credit products, offers merchant partners one source for a variety of open-end credit programs for below-prime consumers, is a business that differs in significant respects from our core business. Consequently, DAMI faces different risks than are associated with Aaron\u2019s sales and lease ownership concept, which Aaron\u2019s and its franchisees offer through their own stores. Because DAMI is operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Progressive, the risks DAMI faces could have a material negative effect on Progressive, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business. These potential risks include, among others, DAMI\u2019s:\n\u2022\nreliance on third party retailers (over whom DAMI cannot exercise the degree of control and oversight that Aaron\u2019s core business, including franchisees, can assert over their own respective employees) for many important business functions, from advertising through assistance with finance applications;\n\u2022\nreliance on a single bank partner to issue DAMI\u2019s HELPcard\u00ae and other credit products. The bank\u2019s regulators could at any time limit or otherwise modify the bank\u2019s ability to continue its relationship with DAMI and any significant interruption of this relationship would result in DAMI being unable to acquire new receivables and provide other credit products. It is possible that a regulatory position or action taken with respect to DAMI\u2019s issuing bank might result in the bank\u2019s inability or unwillingness to originate future credit products on DAMI\u2019s behalf or in partnership with it, which would adversely affect DAMI\u2019s ability to grow its point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer credit products and other consumer credit offerings and underlying receivables. In addition, DAMI\u2019s agreement with its issuing bank partner has a scheduled expiration date. If DAMI is unable to extend or execute a new agreement with its issuing bank upon the expiration of its current agreement, or if its existing agreement was terminated or otherwise disrupted, there is a risk that DAMI would not be able to enter into an agreement with an alternative bank provider on terms that DAMI would consider favorable or in a timely manner without disruption of its business; and\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory risks than those applicable to Aaron\u2019s and Progressive's sales and lease ownership businesses, including risks arising from state credit laws and the offering of open-end credit and the potential that regulators may target DAMI\u2019s operating model and the interest rates it charges.\nThese risks could have a material negative effect on Progressive, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, particularly with respect to our Progressive and DAMI businesses, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, or report them in a timely manner.\nAs a public reporting company subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, we are required to, among other things, establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 so that our management can certify, on an annual basis, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nPrior to their acquisition by us, our Progressive and DAMI businesses were private companies and were not required to establish disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, unlike our core business, these businesses have not historically operated under a fully documented and annually tested system for internal control over financial reporting that is required for public companies by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures - particularly in our Progressive and DAMI businesses - we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, or report them in a timely manner, which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if our senior management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or to certify the effectiveness of such controls, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an unqualified opinion on management\u2019s assessment and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, when required, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public and investor confidence, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price.\nIf we do not maintain the privacy and security of customer, employee, supplier or Company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\nOur business involves the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 personal information, consumer preferences and credit card information, as well as confidential information about our customers, employees, our suppliers and our Company. We also serve as an information technology provider to our franchisees including storing and processing information related to their customers on our systems. Our information systems are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of employee or customer data, could significantly damage our reputation, cause the disclosure of confidential customer, associate, supplier or Company information, and result in significant costs, lost revenues or sales, fines, regulatory enforcement actions and lawsuits. For example, we are currently subject to settlements with the FTC as well as the State of California and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding our business practices and compliance with privacy laws in those states, and data breaches of this nature could result in additional penalties under the terms of those settlements.\nComputer hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or employee information. In addition, one of our employees, contractors or other third parties with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. While we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuse of the data. The regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. These costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with privacy laws, and costs incurred to prevent or remediate information security breaches, could adversely impact our business.\nWe have experienced security incidents in the past, including an incident in which customer information was compromised, although no security incidents have resulted in a material loss to date. We are in the process of improving our system security, although there can be no assurance that these improvements, or others that we implement from time to time, will be effective to prevent all security incidents. We maintain network security and private liability insurance intended to help mitigate the financial risk of such incidents, but there can be no guarantee that insurance will be sufficient to cover all losses related to such incidents.\nA significant compromise of sensitive employee or customer information in our possession could result in legal damages and regulatory penalties. In addition, the costs of defending such actions or remediating breaches could be material. Security breaches could also harm our reputation with our customers and retail partners, potentially leading to decreased revenues.\nIf our information technology systems are impaired, our business could be interrupted, our reputation could be harmed and we may experience lost revenues and increased costs and expenses.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to process transactions with our customers, including tracking lease payments on merchandise, and to manage other important functions of our business. Failures of our systems, such as \"bugs,\" crashes, operator error or catastrophic events, could seriously impair our ability to operate our business. If our information technology systems are impaired, our business (and that of our franchisees) could be interrupted, our reputation could be harmed, we may experience lost revenues or sales and we could experience increased costs and expenses to remediate the problem.\nIf our independent franchisees fail to meet their debt service payments or other obligations under outstanding loans guaranteed by us as part of a franchise loan program, we may be required to pay to satisfy these obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe have guaranteed the borrowings of certain franchisees under a franchise loan program with several banks with a maximum commitment amount of $175.0 million. In the event these franchisees are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience events of default, we would be unconditionally liable for a portion of the outstanding balance of the franchisees\u2019 debt obligations, which at December 31, 2015 was $81.0 million.\nWe have had no significant losses associated with the franchise loan and guaranty program since its inception. Although we believe that any losses associated with defaults would be mitigated through recovery of lease merchandise and other assets, we cannot guarantee that there will be no significant losses in the future or that we will be able to adequately mitigate any such losses. If we fail to adequately mitigate any such future losses, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe are subject to laws that regulate franchisor-franchisee relationships. Our ability to enforce our rights against our franchisees may be adversely affected by these laws, which could impair our growth strategy and cause our franchise revenues to decline.\nAs a franchisor, we are subject to regulation by the FTC, state laws and certain Canadian provincial laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Our failure to comply with applicable franchise regulations could cause us to lose franchise fees and ongoing royalty revenues. Moreover, state and provincial laws that regulate substantive aspects of our relationships with franchisees may limit our ability to terminate or otherwise resolve conflicts with our franchisees.\nWe may engage in litigation with our franchisees.\nAlthough we believe we generally enjoy a positive working relationship with the vast majority of our franchisees, the nature of the franchisor-franchisee relationship may give rise to litigation with our franchisees. In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of complaints or litigation from franchisees, usually related to alleged breaches of contract or wrongful termination under the franchise arrangements. We may also engage in future litigation with franchisees to enforce the terms of our franchise agreements and compliance with our brand standards as determined necessary to protect our brand, the consistency of our products and the customer experience. In addition, we may be subject to claims by our franchisees relating to our Franchise Disclosure Document (the \"FDD\"), including claims based on financial information contained in our FDD. Engaging in such litigation may be costly, time-consuming and may distract management and materially adversely affect our relationships with franchisees and our ability to attract new franchisees. Any negative outcome of these or any other claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations as well as our ability to expand our franchise system and may damage our reputation and brand. Furthermore, existing and future franchise-related legislation could subject us to additional litigation risk in the event we terminate or fail to renew a franchise relationship.\nChanges to the current law with respect to the assignment of liabilities in the franchise business model could adversely impact our profitability.\nOne of the legal foundations fundamental to the franchise business model has been that, absent special circumstances, a franchisor is generally not responsible for the acts, omissions or liabilities of its franchisees. Recently, established law has been challenged and questioned by the plaintiffs\u2019 bar and certain regulators, and the outcome of these challenges and new regulatory positions remains unknown. If these challenges and/or new positions are successful in altering currently settled law, it could significantly change the way we and other franchisors conduct business and adversely impact our profitability.\nFor example, a determination that we are a joint employer with our franchisees or that franchisees are part of one unified system with joint and several liability under the National Labor Relations Act, statutes administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"), regulations and other areas of labor and employment law could subject us and/or our franchisees to liability for the unfair labor practices, wage-and-hour law violations, employment discrimination law violations, OSHA regulation violations and other employment-related liabilities of one or more franchisees. Furthermore, any such change in law would create an increased likelihood that certain franchised networks would be required to employ unionized labor, which could impact franchisors like us through, among other things, increased labor costs and difficulty in attracting new franchisees. In addition, if these changes were to be expanded outside of the employment context, we could be held liable for other claims against franchisees. Therefore, any such regulatory action or court decisions could impact our ability or desire to grow our franchised base and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOperational and other failures by our franchisees may adversely impact us.\nQualified franchisees who conform to our standards and requirements are important to the overall success of our business. Our franchisees, however, are independent businesses and not employees, and consequently we cannot and do not control them to the same extent as our Company-operated stores. Our franchisees may fail in key areas, which could slow our growth, reduce our franchise revenues, damage our reputation, expose us to regulatory enforcement actions or private litigation and/or cause us to incur additional costs.\nFrom time to time we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings which seek material damages or seek to place significant restrictions on our business operations. These proceedings may be negatively perceived by the public and materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings from time to time which may result in material damages or place significant restrictions on our business operations. For example, we are currently subject to settlements with the FTC as well as the State of California and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding our business practices and compliance with privacy laws in those states. Although we do not presently believe that any of our current legal or regulatory proceedings will ultimately have a material adverse impact on our operations, we cannot assure you that we will not incur material damages or penalties in a lawsuit or other proceeding in the future. Significant adverse judgments, penalties, settlement amounts, amounts needed to post a bond pending an appeal or defense costs could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. It is also possible that, as a result of a future governmental or other proceeding or settlement, significant restrictions will be placed upon, or significant changes made to, our business practices, operations or methods, including pricing or similar terms. Any such restrictions or changes may adversely affect our profitability or increase our compliance costs.\nIn addition, certain consumer advocacy groups and federal and state legislators have asserted that laws and regulations should be tightened regarding lease-to-own transactions. The consumer advocacy groups and media reports generally focus on the total cost to a consumer to acquire an item, which is often alleged to be higher than the interest typically charged by banks or similar lending institutions to consumers with better credit histories. This \"cost-of-rental\" amount, which is generally defined as lease fees paid in excess of the \"retail\" price of the goods, is from time to time characterized by consumer advocacy groups and media reports as predatory or abusive without discussing benefits associated with our lease-to-own programs or the lack of viable alternatives for our customers\u2019 needs. If the negative characterization of these types of lease-to-own transactions becomes increasingly accepted by consumers or Progressive\u2019s or DAMI\u2019s retail and merchant partners, demand for our products and services could significantly decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, if the negative characterization of these types of transactions is accepted by legislators and regulators, we could become subject to more restrictive laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The vast expansion and reach of technology, including social media platforms, has increased the risk that our reputation could be significantly impacted by these negative characterizations in a relatively short amount of time. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such characterizations, we may experience declines in customer loyalty and traffic and our relationships with our retail partners may suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of the services of our key executives, or our inability to attract and retain key technical talent in the areas of IT and analytics, could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nWe believe that we have benefited substantially from our current executive leadership and that the unexpected loss of their services in the future could adversely affect our business and operations. We also depend on the continued services of the rest of our management team. The loss of these individuals without adequate replacement could adversely affect our business. Further, we believe that the unexpected loss of certain key technical talent in the areas of information technology and analytics in the future could adversely affect our business and operations. We do not carry key man life insurance on any of our personnel. The inability to attract and retain qualified individuals, or a significant increase in the costs to do so, would materially adversely affect our operations.\nOur competitors could impede our ability to attract new customers, or cause current customers to cease doing business with us.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and highly fluid, particularly in light of the sweeping new regulatory environment we are witnessing from regulators such as the CFPB and the FTC, among others, as discussed above.\nIn the sales and lease ownership market, our competitors include national, regional and local operators of lease-to-own stores, virtual lease-to-own companies and traditional and e-commerce retailers. Our competitors in the traditional and virtual sales and lease ownership and traditional retail markets may have significantly greater financial and operating resources and greater name recognition in certain markets. Greater financial resources may allow our competitors to grow faster than us, including through acquisitions. This in turn may enable them to enter new markets before we can, which may decrease our opportunities in those markets. Greater name recognition, or better public perception of a competitor\u2019s reputation, may help them divert market share away from us, even in our established markets. Some competitors may be willing to offer competing products on an unprofitable basis in an effort to gain market share, which could compel us to match their pricing strategy or lose business.\nOur Progressive business relies heavily on relationships with retail partners. An increase in competition could cause our retail partners to no longer offer the Progressive product in favor of our competitors which could slow growth in the Progressive business and limit profitability.\nIn addition, as a result of changes to the regulatory framework within which we operate, among other reasons, new competitors may emerge or current and potential competitors may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely impact our business.\nWe depend on hiring an adequate number of hourly employees to run our business and are subject to government regulations concerning these and our other employees, including wage and hour regulations.\nOur workforce is comprised primarily of employees who work on an hourly basis. In certain areas where we operate, there is significant competition for employees. The lack of availability of an adequate number of hourly employees or an increase in wages and benefits to current employees could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to service our debt obligations. We are subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees, including wage and hour regulations, health benefits, unemployment and sales taxes, overtime and working conditions and immigration status. Accordingly, legislated increases in the federal minimum wage, as well as increases in additional labor cost components such as employee benefit costs, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, compliance costs and fines, would increase our labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur stock price is volatile, and you may not be able to recover your investment if our stock price declines.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and can be expected to be significantly affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nour ability to meet market expectations with respect to the growth and profitability of each of our operating segments;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations, which may be impacted by, among other things, changes in same store revenues or when and how many locations we acquire or open;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\nstate or federal legislative or regulatory proposals, initiatives, actions or changes that are, or are perceived to be, adverse to our operations;\n\u2022\nthe stock price performance of comparable companies; and\n\u2022\ncontinuing unpredictable global and regional economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market as a whole historically has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many specialty retailers in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance.\nWe are subject to sales, income and other taxes, which can be difficult and complex to calculate due to the nature of our various businesses. A failure to correctly calculate and pay such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales tax, is a complex and evolving issue, particularly with respect to the lease-to-own industry generally and our virtual lease-to-own Progressive and Aarons.com businesses more specifically. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the lease-to-own industry and e-commerce and, therefore, in many cases it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our various businesses. In addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenues, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenues, including through indirect taxes. This also could result in other adverse changes in or interpretations of existing sales, income and other tax regulations. For example, from time to time, some taxing authorities in the United States have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on transactions with our customers. Although these notifications have not resulted in material tax liabilities to date, there is a risk that one or more jurisdictions may be successful in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 78049, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "AAN"}
