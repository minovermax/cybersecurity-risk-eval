{"cik": "860518", "company": "ITEX CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-10-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that are forward-looking such as estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements that express expectations and projections with respect to future matters may be affected by changes in our strategic direction, as well as developments beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those listed below, in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d, Part II Item 7 and elsewhere in this report. These factors, among others, may adversely impact and impair our business and should be considered in evaluating our financial outlook.\nOur revenue growth and success is tied to the operations of our Broker Network, and as a result the loss of our brokers or the financial performance of our brokers can negatively impact our business\nOur financial success primarily depends on our brokers and the manner in which they operate and develop their offices. We depend on the ability of our brokers to enroll new members, train them in the use of the Marketplace, grow our transactional volume by facilitating business among members, manage member relationships, provide members with information about ITEX products and services, and assure the payment of our fees. Brokers are independently owned and operated and have a contractual relationship with ITEX, typically for a renewable five-year term. Our inability to renew a significant portion of these agreements on terms satisfactory to our brokers and us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our brokers may not be successful in increasing the level of revenues generated compared to prior years, or even sustaining their own business activities, which depends on many factors, including industry trends, the strength of the local economy, the success of their marketing activities, control of expense levels, the employment and management of personnel, and being able to secure adequate financing to operate their businesses. There can be no assurance that our brokers will be successful in adding members or increasing the volume of transactions through the Marketplace, or that if they do not renew their agreements or terminate operations we will be able to attract new brokers at rates sufficient to maintain a stable or growing revenue base. If our brokers are unsuccessful in generating revenue, enrolling new members to equalize the attrition of members leaving the Marketplace, or if a significant number of brokers become financially distressed and terminate operations, our revenues could be reduced and our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nFuture revenue growth remains uncertain and our operating results and profitability may decline\nMarketplace revenue decreased 11% for the year ended July 31, 2015, compared to the previous year ended July 31, 2014 and decreased 9% for the year ended July 31, 2014 compared to the same period ended July 31, 2013. Although we seek to increase revenues through organic growth and the development of new revenue streams, we cannot assure you that our revenues will increase in future quarters or future years. We may be unable to add revenue through acquisitions, either because of the absence of acquisition candidates, lack of financing, or unacceptable terms. We have approximately 33% recurring revenues. We do not have an order backlog, and approximately 63% of our revenues each quarter come from variable transaction fees computed as a percentage of the ITEX dollar value of the transactions occurring during that quarter.\nWe cannot assure you that we can continue to be operated profitably, which depends on many factors, including, our success in expanding our member base, the control of our expense levels, and the success of our business activities. We may make investments in marketing, broker and member support, technology and further development of our operating infrastructure which entail long-term commitments. Our industry as a whole may be adversely affected by industry trends, economic factors and new regulations. Despite our efforts to expand our revenues, we may not be successful. We experience a certain amount of attrition from members leaving the Marketplace. If new member enrollments do not continue or are insufficient to offset attrition, we will increasingly need to focus on keeping existing members active and increasing their activity level in order to maintain or grow our business. We cannot assure you that this strategy would be successful to offset declining revenues or profits.\nSubstantial and increasing competition from the ecommerce industry, exchanges and other distribution channels may adversely affect our overall business, revenues and results of operations\nWe encounter significant competition in our efforts to develop our Marketplace. Our competitors include internet distribution channels and local Exchanges. Internet distribution channel competitors include well-known companies such as eBay, Travelocity, Priceline, Amazon and Overstock. Similar to our Marketplace, these companies provide distribution channels to move excess or surplus inventory. We currently and potentially compete with a wide variety of online and offline companies providing products and services to consumers and merchants, including big box stores. The internet and mobile networks provide new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of products and services. The greater the number of avenues to move excess inventory or products and services, the more competitive it is to attract businesses to trade their inventory in our Marketplace. We also compete with these companies with respect to price, ease of use and brand name awareness.\nWe compete with other Exchanges primarily on a service basis, the number of products and services available in the Marketplace and the liquidity of ITEX dollars. In addition to existing Exchanges, new competitors could launch new Exchanges at a relatively low cost since technological and financial barriers to entry are relatively low. Businesses can readily launch online sites or mobile platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software. Potential competitors undertaking this effort could include companies with longer operating histories, greater market presence and name recognition, larger customer bases and greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have.\nOur ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to enhance and improve our existing services, adapt to current technologies, and to continually improve our operating efficiencies. Our competitors may develop competing exchanges, distribution channels, technologies, products or strategic alliances and affiliations that make our brand, products and services less marketable or less useful or desirable. Increased competition could result in erosion of our market share, and adversely affect our revenues, business operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by our lack of liquidity or access to capital.\nOur dividend policy is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon a number of factors, including our earnings, financial condition, cash and capital needs and general economic or business conditions. Although we are currently declaring cash dividends on our common stock as a way to return value to our stockholders, we are not required to do so and we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends in the future. If liquidity from our cash flow is inadequate or unavailable, we may be required to scale back or eliminate the dividends we pay to our stockholders. Any reduction of, or the elimination of, our common stock dividend in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income would be limited if we do not generate sufficient taxable income or if an ownership change occurs, which would negatively impact our results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity\nAs of July 31, 2015, we reported a consolidated federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforward and deferred tax asset of $3,678, which represents approximately 34% of our total assets. The use of our NOL carryforwards is subject to uncertainty because, in addition to the factors discussed below, it is dependent upon the amount of taxable income we generate. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income, if any, in future years to use the net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. If we have uncertainties surrounding our ability to continue to generate future taxable income to realize these tax assets, a valuation allowance will be established to offset our deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized.\nAdditionally, the future utilization of our NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation as a result of ownership changes that could occur in the future. Federal and state tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of NOL and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Generally, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of the value of the stock that is owned in the aggregate by our direct or indirect \u201cfive percent shareholders\u201d increases by more than 50% over their lowest ownership percentage at any time during any three-year testing period. Future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an \u201cownership change.\u201d In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the purchase price could result in an \u201cownership change.\u201d If an \u201cownership change\u201d has occurred or does occur in the future, utilization of the NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and cause us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than we otherwise would, adversely affecting our future cash flow. The write off of NOL carryforward tax benefits would also negatively affect our net earnings and reduce stockholders\u2019 equity.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings, and there could be a negative impact on stockholders\u2019 equity\nWe have goodwill of $3,191 and net other intangible assets of $102 as of July 31, 2015, which represents approximately 31% of our total assets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identified net assets acquired. Goodwill acquired in a purchase business combination is determined to have an indefinite useful life and is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, adverse changes in legal factors or the business climate, and lowered expectations of future financial results. We may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, which would reduce earnings in such period, and reduce stockholders\u2019 equity. We cannot accurately predict the amount, if any, or the timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nOur brokers could take actions that could harm our business, our reputation and adversely affect the ITEX Marketplace\nOur agreements with our brokers require that they understand and comply with all laws and regulations applicable to their businesses, and operate in compliance with our Marketplace Rules. Brokers are independently owned and operated and are not our employees, partners, or affiliates. We set forth operational standards and guidelines; however, we have limited control over how our broker businesses are run. Our brokers have individual business strategies and objectives, and may not operate their offices in a manner consistent with our philosophy and standards. We cannot assure that our brokers will avoid actions that adversely affect the reputation of ITEX or the Marketplace. Improper activity stemming from one broker can generate negative publicity which could adversely affect our entire Broker Network and the Marketplace. Our image and reputation and the image and reputation of other brokers may suffer materially, and system-wide sales could significantly decline if our brokers do not operate their businesses according to our standards. While we ultimately can take action to terminate brokers that do not comply with the standards contained in our agreements, and even though we may implement compliance and monitoring functions, we may not be able to identify problems and take action quickly enough and, as a result, our image and reputation may suffer, causing our revenues or profitability to decline. Further, the success and growth of our Broker Network depends on our maintaining a satisfactory working relationship with our existing brokers and attracting new brokers to our network. Lawsuits and other disputes with our brokers could discourage our brokers from expanding their business or lead to negative publicity, which could discourage new brokers from entering our network or existing brokers from renewing their agreements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStockholders or investors may attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring the past several years, U.S. companies have seen an increasing level of insurgent campaigns, proxy solicitations, and shareholder derivative actions or other attempts to acquire control of companies or effect operational changes. In recent years, we have been the subject of two proxy contests seeking control of our board of directors, as well as a related lawsuit. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to further proxy contests, litigation or other activity or demands in the future. If we are, such activity or demands could harm the Company because:\n\u00b7 Responding to proxy contests, litigation and other actions by dissident shareholders can interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our management and employees from the pursuit of business strategies;\n\u00b7 Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction diverts the attention of, damages morale and creates instability among members of our Broker Network, and adversely impact our existing and potential strategic and operational relationships and opportunities;\n\u00b7 We may experience difficulties in hiring, retaining and motivating personnel during the resulting uncertain and turbulent times;\n\u00b7 If individuals are elected or appointed to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders;\n\u00b7 We would experience substantial increases in legal fees, insurance, administrative and associated costs incurred in connection with responding to proxy contests and related litigation;\n\u00b7 A successful change in control of the Company could result in compensation charges and other expenses, and potentially allow an insurgent shareholder to reimburse his proxy or takeover expenses, resulting in substantial charges.\nFailure to deal effectively with member disputes could result in costly litigation, damage our reputation and harm our business\nITEX faces risks with respect to transactional disputes between members of the Marketplace. While ITEX does, in some cases, as part of its transaction dispute resolution process, reverse transactions, reduce or eliminate credit lines, suspend accounts, or take other measures with members who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other members, the determination as to whether a transaction is reversed or how to resolve a specific dispute is made by ITEX in its sole discretion. Measures we may take to resolve transactional disputes or combat risks of fraud have the potential to damage relations with our members or brokers or decrease transactional activity in the Marketplace by restricting the activities of certain members. Furthermore, negative publicity and member sentiment generated as a result of member complaints or fraudulent or deceptive conduct by members of our Marketplace could damage our reputation, or reduce our ability to attract new members or retain our current members.\nWe occasionally receive communications from members requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made. In addition, because we service our member businesses through our Broker Network, we are subject to claims and could potentially be found liable for the conduct of our brokers in a situation where that broker has caused injury to a member. Litigation involving disputes between members and liability for broker actions could be costly and time consuming for us, divert management attention, result in increased costs of doing business, lead to adverse judgments, or otherwise harm our business. In addition, affected members may complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us, including imposing fines or seeking injunctions.\nWe may be held responsible by members, third parties, regulators or courts for the actions of, or failures to act by, our brokers or their employees, which exposes us to possible adverse judgments, other liabilities and negative publicity\nFrom time to time we are subject to claims for the conduct of our brokers in situations where a broker is alleged to have caused injury to a member as a result of a transaction in the Marketplace. Third parties, regulators or courts may seek to hold us responsible for the actions or failures to act by our brokers or their employees. The failure to comply with laws and regulations by our brokers, or litigation involving potential liability for broker activities could be costly and time consuming for us, divert management attention, result in increased costs of doing business, lead to adverse judgments, expose us to possible fines and negative publicity, or otherwise harm our business.\nOur business is subject to government regulation and future regulation or regulatory changes may increase the cost of compliance and doing business\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our businesses. These include the requirement to obtain business licenses, withhold taxes, remit matching contributions for our employees\u2019 social security accounts, and other such legal requirements, regulations and administrative practices required of businesses in general. We are a third party record-keeper under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (\u201cTEFRA\u201d) and accordingly, we account for and report annually to the IRS the total ITEX dollar sales transactions, net of any returns, of each member in our Marketplace. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act and state franchise and business opportunity laws, our franchisees are entitled to certain protections including mandatory disclosures and the provision that many of the substantive aspects of the business relationship (i.e., termination, transfer, cancellation, and non-renewal) will be governed by state law. An adverse finding in one or more of these business relationship aspects could govern the enforceability of our franchise agreements or permit the recovery of damages and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn addition, we are currently or potentially subject to laws and regulations affecting our operations in a number of other areas, including data privacy requirements, intellectual property ownership and infringement, prohibited items and stolen goods, digital content, promotions, virtual currency, taxes, as well as laws and regulations intended to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities. With respect to our online and mobile operations, it is not always clear how certain laws and regulations apply to our business. Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet, mobile, and related technologies and, as a result, are subject to interpretation by the courts on an ongoing basis. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that future internet-related regulation or regulatory changes might have on our business. Compliance with these laws, regulations, and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and variances and inconsistencies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make our services less attractive to our members, delay the introduction of new products or services in one or more regions, or cause us to change or limit our business practices. We implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees or brokers will not violate these laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.\nUse of our services for illegal purposes could damage our reputation and harm our business\nOur members, typically small businesses, actively market products and services through the Marketplace and our website. We may be unable to prevent our members from selling unlawful or stolen goods or unlawful services, or selling goods or services in an unlawful manner, and we could be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by members through our services. It is possible that third parties, including government regulators and law enforcement officials, could allege that our services aid and abet certain violations of certain laws, for example, laws regarding the sale of counterfeit items, the fencing of stolen goods, selective distribution channel laws, and the sale of items outside of the U.S. that are regulated by U.S. export controls.\nAlthough we have prohibited the listing of illegal products and services and implemented other protective measures, we may be required to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings, any of which could harm our business. Any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the alleged or actual sale of unlawful goods or services could harm our business. In addition, negative media publicity relating to the listing or sale of unlawful goods and stolen goods using our services could damage our reputation, diminish the value of our brand, and make members reluctant to use our services.\nRecent changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities. Despite measures taken by ITEX as administrator and as transaction processor and record-keeper to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct, illegal activities could still be funded using ITEX dollars. Any resulting claims or liabilities could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft\nWe host confidential information as part of our client relationship management and transactional processing platform. Our security measures may not detect or prevent security breaches that could harm our business. Currently, a significant number of our members authorize us to bill their credit card or bank accounts directly for fees charged by us. We take a number of measures to ensure the security of our hardware and software systems and member and client information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised. Many companies have been the subject of sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites. In addition, any party who is able to illicitly obtain a members\u2019 password could access the members\u2019 transaction data. An increasing number of websites have reported breaches of their security. Any compromise of our security could harm our reputation and, therefore, our business, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws. In addition, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. Under credit card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of credit card information that we store, we could be liable to the credit card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, if we fail to follow credit card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to pay their fees. If we were unable to accept credit cards, our business would be seriously damaged.\nWe enhance our systems for data management and protection, and intrusion detection and prevention. However, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches, including any breach by us or by parties with which we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of our members\u2019 personal information, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies carry coverage limits which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nThe emergence of increased regulation related to virtual currencies could increase our costs by requiring us to update our products and services; or subject us to operational requirements that result in substantial compliance costs which would adversely affect our business\nInnovation in the payments industry has led to a variety of virtual currencies, community currencies and reward points, and federal and state regulatory regimes are seeking to revise antiquated currency provisions. The increased attention to virtual currencies could result in changes in federal or state regulations or the adoption of new regulations that could affect us as well as many companies transacting in credits that might be considered \u201cvirtual currency.\u201d For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury, as the delegated administrator of the Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) issued interpretive guidance in March 2013 to clarify the applicability of regulations to persons creating, obtaining, distributing, exchanging, accepting, or transmitting virtual currencies. Although we do not believe we as an administer of a Marketplace utilizing ITEX dollars are currently subject to the BSA requirements, that could potentially change with new regulation. Registering with FinCEN and complying with FinCEN\u2019s regulations would be burdensome, as would getting licensed as a money transmitter and complying with the money transmission regulatory regimes in each state. Changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations relating to the use of virtual currencies could require us to incur significant costs to update our products and services, significantly increase our compliance costs or may impose conditions that we are unable to meet. This could make our business cost-prohibitive in the affected state or states and could materially adversely affect our business.\nUnplanned system interruptions or system failures could harm our business and reputation\nAny interruption in the availability of our transactional processing services due to hardware and operating system failures will reduce our revenues and profits. Our revenue depends on members using our processing services. Any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential members to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our website or services, and could permanently harm our reputation. Furthermore, any system failures could result in damage to our members\u2019 and brokers\u2019 businesses. These persons could seek compensation from us for their losses. Even if unsuccessful, this type of claim likely would be time-consuming and costly for us to address.\nAlthough our systems have been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, and similar events or disruptions. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data, and result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations that protect our members\u2019 and brokers\u2019 personal and financial information could result in liability and harm our reputation\nWe store personal and financial information for members of the Marketplace and our brokers. Privacy concerns relating to the disclosure and safeguarding of personal and financial information have drawn increased attention from federal and state governments. Federal and state law requires us to safeguard our members\u2019 and brokers\u2019 financial information, including credit card information. Although we have established security procedures to protect against identity theft and the theft of this personal and financial information, breaches of our privacy may occur. To the extent the measures we have implemented are breached or if there is an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or personal information or data, we may become subject to litigation or administrative sanctions, which could result in significant fines, penalties or damages and harm to our brand and reputation. Even if we were not held liable, a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or personal information or data could harm our reputation. In addition, we may be required to invest additional resources to protect us against damages caused by these actual or perceived disruptions or security breaches in the future. Changes in these federal and state regulatory requirements could result in more stringent requirements and could result in a need to change our business practices. Establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these new requirements may increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes\nFrom time to time we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. See Note 11 - \u201cLegal Proceedings and Litigation Contingencies\u201d included in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d. Adverse outcomes in one or more claims could occur which may result in significant monetary damages that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Although management does not believe resolving any pending matter, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.\nIf we lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer, our business could suffer\nOur Board places heavy reliance on the continued services of our Chief Executive Officer, Steven White, and his industry experience and relationships, management and operational skills. We have not entered into an employment agreement with Mr. White. If we were to lose the services of Mr. White, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring a qualified successor or successors, and could experience a loss in performance while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience. Corporate staff and our brokers could lose confidence in the direction and stability of the Company and choose to pursue other opportunities. In addition, in connection with a management transition we may need to attract, train, retain and motivate additional financial, technical, managerial, marketing or support personnel. We face the risk that if we are unable to attract and integrate new personnel, or retain and motivate existing personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAlliances, mergers and acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences\nWe expect to evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets and strategic investments. At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is risky. The areas where we may face difficulties include:\nl Diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to challenges related to integration and administration;\nl Challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into the acquiring organization. These may include declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in, or acceleration of, compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the business;\nl The need to integrate each company\u2019s accounting, management, information, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;\nl The need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures and policies;\nl The need to transition operations, members, and customers onto our existing platforms; and\nl Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities.\nThe expected benefit of any of these strategic relationships may not materialize and the cost of these efforts may negatively impact our financial results. Future alliances, mergers or acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the expenditure of our cash or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses of which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.\nWe may need additional financing; current funds may be insufficient to finance our plans for growth or our operations\nWe believe that our financial condition is stable and that our cash balances and operating cash flows provide adequate resources to fund our ordinary operating requirements. However, our existing working capital may not be sufficient to allow us to execute our business plan as fast as we would like or may not be sufficient to take full advantage of all available strategic opportunities. We believe our current core operations reflect a scalable business strategy, which will allow our business model to be executed with limited outside financing. However, we also may expand our operations, enter into a strategic transaction, or acquire competitors or other business to business enterprises. If adequate capital was not available or were not available on acceptable terms at a time when we needed it, our ability to execute our business plans, develop or enhance our services, make acquisitions or respond to competitive pressures would be significantly impaired. Further, we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement various financing alternatives or otherwise obtain required working capital if needed or desired.\nWe are dependent on the value of foreign currency.\nWe transact business in Canadian dollars as well as USD. Revenues denominated in Canadian dollars comprised 6.2% and 6.7% of total revenue in the years ended July 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Part of our cash reserves are held in Canadian banks and subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency expense for the year ended July 31, 2015 increased by $119 compared to the year ended July 31, 2014. Foreign currency exchange fluctuations may or may not materially adversely affect our operations. Changes in the relation of the Canadian dollar to the USD could affect our revenues, cost of sales, operating margins or value of bank holdings which could result in exchange losses.\nOur Brokers may default on their loans\nFrom time to time we finance the operational and expansion activities of our brokers. We loan brokers funds for general operational purposes, to acquire the management rights to select member accounts, and for other reasons. These loans are repaid from regular deductions from broker commissions. We had outstanding loans to brokers of $1,083 at July 31, 2015 and $1,424 at July 31, 2014. In the event one or more brokers default on their loans, it may adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe market for our securities has limited liquidity and may become less liquid\nOur common stock trades on the OTC Pink tier of the over-the-counter market known as the OTC Marketplace. The OTC Marketplace has three tiers, consisting of OTCQX, OTCQB and OTC Pink marketplaces. Many of the securities quoted in the OTC Marketplace do not have a liquid market. They are infrequently traded and can move up or down in price substantially from one trade to the next. As a result, an investment in our shares may be illiquid even if there is a market. Moreover, our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange. Under current regulations national securities exchanges have the ability to offer certain advantages to listed companies. For example, securities listed on a national securities exchange are exempt from state Blue Sky laws covering the offer or sale of securities within the state. We avail ourselves of applicable Blue Sky exemptions, however there are certain states in which we have not qualified for an exemption and our shares may not be traded. National securities exchanges also offer the ability to margin certain listed securities and the potential inclusion of listed securities in certain exchange-traded funds and indices. These differences between our marketplace and the national securities exchanges may make certain investors choose to not invest in our stock.", "PERMNO": 80455, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "ITEX"}
