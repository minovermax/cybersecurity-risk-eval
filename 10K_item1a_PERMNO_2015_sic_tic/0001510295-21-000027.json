{"cik": "1510295", "company": "Marathon Petroleum Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our common stock. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in demand for the petroleum products that we manufacture, sell, transport and store, which has had, and may continue to have, a material and adverse effect on our business and on general economic, financial and business conditions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact worldwide economic and commercial activity. Travel restrictions, business and school closures, increased remote work, stay-at-home orders and other actions taken by individuals, governments and the private sector to stem the spread of the virus have significantly reduced global economic activity, significantly reduced demand for the petroleum products that we manufacture, sell, transport and store, and contributed to increased market and oil price volatility. Our refinery utilization and operating margins and other aspects of our business have been adversely impacted by these developments.\nDuring 2020, there were significant variations in the market prices of products held in our inventories. In each quarter of 2020, these variations required us to record either inventory valuation charges or benefits to reflect the valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market.\nDepending on future movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative or positive effect on our financial performance. In addition, a sustained period of low crude oil prices may also result in significant financial constraints on certain producers from which we acquire our crude oil, which could result in long term crude oil supply constraints for our business. Such conditions could also result in an increased risk that our customers and other counterparties may be unable to fully fulfill their obligations in a timely manner, or at all.\nResurgences in COVID-19 infections could result in the imposition of new stay-at-home orders or other restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, which could further weaken demand for the petroleum products we manufacture, sell, transport and store, and could contribute to increased market and oil price volatility.\nA prolonged period of economic slowdown or recession, or a protracted period of depressed prices for crude oil or refined petroleum products, could continue to have significant and adverse consequences for our financial condition and the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other counterparties, and\ncould diminish our liquidity, trigger additional impairments and negatively affect our ability to obtain adequate crude oil volumes and to market certain of our products at favorable prices, or at all.\nThe ultimate extent to which COVID-19 will continue to negatively affect us and our customers, suppliers and other counterparties will depend largely on the length and severity of the pandemic; actions taken by individuals, governments and the private sector to stem the spread of the virus; general economic conditions; and the availability and widespread distribution and use of safe and effective vaccines, all of which cannot be predicted with certainty.\nOur financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent on factors beyond our control.\nOur operating results, cash flows, future rate of growth, the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products. Historically, refining and marketing margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile. Our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions, including the price of crude oil. The price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and refined products;\n\u2022transportation infrastructure availability, local market conditions and operation levels of other refineries in our markets;\n\u2022natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries;\n\u2022political instability, threatened or actual terrorist incidents, armed conflict or other global political conditions;\n\u2022local weather conditions;\n\u2022seasonality of demand in our marketing areas due to increased highway traffic in the spring and summer months;\n\u2022natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and\n\u2022local, regional, national and worldwide economic conditions.\nSome of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. The longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain. We purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products. Price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks can have a significant effect on our financial results. We also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers. Price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products can have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLower refining and marketing margins have in the past, and may in the future, lead us to reduce the amount of refined products we produce, which may reduce our revenues, income from operations and cash flows. Significant reductions in refining and marketing margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures, impair the carrying value of our assets (such as property, plant and equipment, inventory or goodwill), and require us to re-evaluate practices regarding our repurchase activity and dividends.\nLegal, technological, political and scientific developments regarding emissions and fuel efficiency may decrease demand for transportation fuels.\nDevelopments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing vehicle efficiency may decrease the demand or increase the cost for our transportation fuels. In March 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) and the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) released the final Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (\u201cSAFE\u201d) Vehicles Rule setting corporate average fuel economy (\u201cCAFE\u201d) and carbon dioxide (\u201cCO2\u201d) standards for model years 2021 through 2026 passenger cars and light trucks. The final rule increases the stringency of CAFE and CO2 emission standards by 1.5 percent each year from model years 2021 through 2026. The rule has been challenged in court and could be revised by the Biden Administration through notice and comment rulemaking. In addition, California\u2019s governor issued an executive order requiring sales of all new passenger vehicles in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Other states have, or may issue, zero-emission\nvehicle mandates. Future developments involving climate change and environmental laws and regulations may require heightened fuel efficiency standards.\nGovernment efforts to steer the public toward non-petroleum-based fuel dependent modes of transportation may foster a negative perception toward transportation fuels or increase costs for our products. New technologies that increase fuel efficiency or offer alternative vehicle power sources and the proliferation of alternative-fuel vehicles (i.e., vehicles that do not use petroleum-based transportation fuels or that are powered by hybrid engines) may result in decreased demand for petroleum-based transportation fuel. These developments could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, which could materially and adversely affect our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to business interruptions, such as scheduled and unscheduled refinery turnarounds, unplanned maintenance, explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases, power outages, severe weather, labor disputes, acts of terrorism, or other natural or man-made disasters. The inability to operate one or more of our facilities due to any of these events could significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products.\nExplosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases, product quality or other incidents may result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. We have experienced certain of these incidents in the past. For assets located near populated areas, the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater.\nIn addition, we operate in and adjacent to environmentally sensitive waters where tanker, pipeline, rail car and refined product transportation and storage operations are closely regulated by federal, state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups. Certain of our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks by tanker or barge. MPLX operates a fleet of boats and barges to transport light products, heavy oils, crude oil, renewable fuels, chemicals and feedstocks to and from refineries and terminals owned by MPC. Transportation and storage of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined products over and adjacent to water involves inherent risk and subjects us to the provisions of the OPA-90 and state laws in U.S. coastal and Great Lakes states and states bordering inland waterways on which we operate, as well as international laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. If we are unable to promptly and adequately contain any accident or discharge involving tankers, pipelines, rail cars or above ground storage tanks transporting or storing crude oil, other feedstocks or refined products, we may be subject to substantial liability. In addition, the service providers contracted to aid us in a discharge response may be unavailable due to weather conditions, governmental regulations or other local or global events.\nDamages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities.\nWe rely on the performance of our information technology systems, and the interruption or failure of any information technology system, including an interruption or failure due to a cybersecurity breach, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information technology systems (and those of our third-party business partners, whether cloud-based or hosted on proprietary servers), including our network infrastructure and cloud applications, for the safe and effective operation of our business. We rely on such systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, including financial records and personally identifiable information such as employee, customer, investor and payroll data, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including our supply chain, pipeline operations, gathering and processing operations, retail sales, credit card payments and authorizations at our retail outlets, financial transactions, banking and numerous other processes and transactions. Our systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, malware, power failures, cyber-attacks and other events. We also face various other cybersecurity threats from criminal hackers and employee malfeasance, including threats to gain unauthorized access to our computer network and systems or render data or systems unusable.\nOur cybersecurity protections, infrastructure protection technologies, disaster recovery plans and employee training may not be sufficient to defend us against all unauthorized attempts to access our information. We have been and may in the future be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to our computer network and systems. To date, the impacts of prior events have not had a material adverse effect on us.\nAny cybersecurity incident involving our information technology systems or those of our third-party business partners could result in theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential financial and other data, intellectual property, customer awards or loyalty points; give rise to remediation or other expenses; expose us to liability under federal and state laws; reduce our customers\u2019 willingness to do business with us; disrupt the services we provide to customers; and subject us to litigation and legal liability under federal and state laws. Any of such results could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business.\nWe compete with a broad range of refining and marketing companies, including certain multinational oil companies. Competitors with integrated operations with exploration and production resources and broader access to resources may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions and to bear the risks inherent in the refining industry. For example, competitors that engage in exploration and production of crude oil may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.\nWe have agreed to sell Speedway to 7-Eleven. Nevertheless, pending closing of the Speedway sale, which remains subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals, we still face strong competition in the market for the retail sale of transportation fuels and merchandise. Our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers, and other well-recognized national or regional retail outlets, often selling transportation fuels and merchandise at very competitive prices. Non-traditional transportation fuel retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market. These retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the pump and in the store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales, which could in turn pressure us to offer similar discounts. Additionally, the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either transportation fuels or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and refined products.\nWe utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries. In addition to our own operational risks, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations or third-party actions.\nIn particular, pipelines or railroads provide a nearly exclusive form of transportation of crude oil to, or refined products from, some of our refineries. A prolonged interruption, material reduction or cessation of service of such a pipeline or railway, whether due to private party or governmental action or other reason, or any other prolonged disruption of the ability of the trucks, pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant decrease in oil and natural gas production in MPLX\u2019s areas of operation may adversely affect MPLX\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including MPC.\nA significant portion of MPLX\u2019s operations is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas and crude oil production. The production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells owned by its producer customers will naturally decline over time, which means that MPLX\u2019s cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time. To maintain or increase throughput levels and the utilization rate of MPLX\u2019s facilities, MPLX must continually obtain new oil, natural gas, NGL and refined product supplies, which depend in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities, its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand its system capacity as needed.\nWe have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of MPLX\u2019s operations, the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline. In addition, we have no control over producers or their production decisions, which are affected by demand, prevailing and projected energy prices, drilling costs, operational challenges, access to downstream markets, the level of reserves, geological considerations, governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital. Reductions in exploration or production activity in MPLX\u2019s areas of operations could lead to reduced throughput on its pipelines and utilization rates of its facilities.\nDecreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity, production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves. The prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs depend upon factors beyond our control, including global and local demand, production levels, changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications, imports and exports, seasonality and weather conditions, economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations. Sustained periods of low prices could result in producers deciding to limit their oil and gas drilling operations, which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs to MPLX\u2019s facilities and adversely affect their revenues and cash available for distribution to us.\nThis impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of MPLX\u2019s commodity-based contracts, which are more directly impacted by changes in natural gas and NGL prices than its fee-based contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a Btu equivalent basis than NGL products. In addition, the purchase and resale of natural gas and NGLs in the ordinary course exposes our Midstream operations to volatility in natural gas or NGL prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales and the potential difference in the price associated with each transaction, and direct exposure may also occur naturally as a result of production processes. Also, the significant volatility in natural gas, NGL and oil prices could adversely impact MPLX\u2019s unit price, thereby increasing its distribution yield and cost of capital. Such impacts could adversely impact MPLX\u2019s ability to execute its long-term organic growth projects, satisfy obligations to its customers and make distributions to unitholders at intended levels, and may also result in non-cash impairments of long-lived assets or goodwill or other-than-temporary non-cash impairments of our equity method investments.\nSevere weather events and other climate conditions may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations.\nOur facilities are subject to potential acute physical risks, such as floods, hurricane-force winds, wildfires and snowstorms, and potential chronic physical risks, such as sea-level rise or water shortages. If any such events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to protect our assets and operations from such physical risks and employ the evolving technologies and processes available to mitigate such risks. To the extent such severe weather events or other climate conditions increase in frequency and severity, we may be required to modify operations and incur costs that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks arising from our operations outside the United States and generally to worldwide political and economic developments.\nWe operate and sell some of our products outside the United States, particularly in Mexico, South America and Asia. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by disruptions in any of these markets, including economic instability, restrictions on the transfer of funds, duties and tariffs, transportation delays, difficulty in enforcing contractual provisions, import and export controls, changes in governmental policies, labor unrest, security issues involving key personnel and changing regulatory and political environments. Global outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could affect demand for refined products and economic conditions generally. In addition, if trade relationships deteriorate with these countries, if existing trade agreements are modified or terminated, if new economic sanctions relevant to such jurisdictions are passed or if taxes, border adjustments or tariffs make trading with these countries more costly, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are required to comply with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. Our compliance policies and programs mandate\ncompliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws but may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance. Our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents. Actual or alleged violations of these laws could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant legal expenses, and could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMore broadly, political and economic factors in global markets could impact crude oil and other feedstock supplies and could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways. Hostilities in the Middle East or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products, NGLs and natural gas. Additionally, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. Additionally, tax policy, legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability. For example, the U.S. government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products, NGLs, natural gas or the conduct of business in or with certain foreign countries. In addition, foreign countries could restrict imports, investments or commercial transactions.\nOur investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our reliance on our joint venture partners and their financial condition, and our joint venture partners may have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\nWe conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partners. Our joint venture partners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have an interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTerrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business.\nRefining, gathering and processing, pipeline and terminal infrastructure, and other energy assets, may be future targets of terrorist organizations. Any terrorist attack on our facilities, those of our customers and, in some cases, those of other energy assets, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nFinancial Risks\nWe have significant debt obligations; therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile or downgrade of our credit ratings, a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us, or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally.\nAt December 31, 2020, our total debt obligations for borrowed money and finance lease obligations were $32.17 billion, including $20.54 billion of obligations of MPLX and its subsidiaries and $130 million of obligations of Speedway. We may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future.\nOur indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\n\u2022limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders;\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other purposes.\nA decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity, including unsecured credit extended by third-party suppliers, or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit. Our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. The planned Speedway sale could be a factor causing or contributing to a future determination by one or more of the rating agencies to lower our credit rating. Any changes in our credit capacity or credit profile could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to $750 million depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables outstanding. In periods of lower prices, we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility.\nOur working capital, cash flows and liquidity can be significantly affected by decreases in commodity prices.\nPayment terms for our crude oil purchases are generally longer than the terms we extend to our customers for refined product sales. As a result, the payables for our crude oil purchases are proportionally larger than the receivables for our refined product sales. Due to this net payables position, a decrease in commodity prices generally results in a use of working capital, and given the significant volume of crude oil that we purchase the impact can materially affect our working capital, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe expected phase out of LIBOR could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and could cause our interest expense to increase.\nA portion of our borrowing capacity and outstanding indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR. The ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (\u201cICE\u201d) announced that it will cease calculating and publishing all USD LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023 and cease calculating and publishing certain USD LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021. Further, U.K. and U.S. regulatory authorities have recently issued statements encouraging banks to cease entering into new USD LIBOR based loans as soon as possible and by no later than December 31, 2021 and to continue to transition away from USD LIBOR based loans in preparation of ICE ceasing to calculate and public LIBOR based rates on June 30, 2023. These developments may cause fluctuations in LIBOR rates and pricing of USD LIBOR based loans that are not transitioned to a new benchmark rate.\nThe agreements that govern our variable rate indebtedness contain customary transition and fallback provisions in contemplation of the cessation of LIBOR. Nevertheless, at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR, other benchmarks or floating rate indebtedness. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuance, modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks. Furthermore, the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the market value of, the applicable interest rate on and the amount of interest paid on our floating rate indebtedness to be materially different than expected and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance such floating rate indebtedness or raise future indebtedness on a cost effective basis.\nWe may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions.\nWe currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. If the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. Derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. The risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment. In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us.\nWe do not insure against all potential losses, and, therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.\nWe maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many, but not all, potential liabilities arising from operating hazards. Uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards such as explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases, cybersecurity breaches or other incidents involving our\nassets or operations, could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates.\nWe have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become further impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.\nWe accounted for the Andeavor and other acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets and liabilities of the acquired business be recorded to our balance sheet at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recognized as goodwill.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our balance sheet reflected $8.3 billion and $2.4 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets, respectively. In 2020, we recorded approximately $7.4 billion and $177 million in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment expense, respectively. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes further impaired, we may be required to incur additional material non-cash charges relating to such impairment. Our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment.\nLarge capital projects can take years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date, negatively impacting project returns.\nWe have several large capital projects underway, including the activities associated with the conversion of the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility. Delays in completing capital projects or making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022denials of, delays in receiving, or revocations of requisite regulatory approvals or permits;\n\u2022unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;\n\u2022disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;\n\u2022shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;\n\u2022market-related increases in a project\u2019s debt or equity financing costs;\n\u2022nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors; and\n\u2022delays due to citizen, state or local political or activist pressure.\nAny one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. If we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs to meet the requirements of evolving environmental or other laws or regulations. Future environmental laws and regulations may impact our current business plans and reduce demand for our products.\nOur business is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our business. Laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following:\n\u2022the emission or discharge of materials into the environment,\n\u2022solid and hazardous waste management,\n\u2022the regulatory classification of materials currently or formerly used in our business,\n\u2022pollution prevention,\n\u2022greenhouse gas emissions,\n\u2022climate change,\n\u2022characteristics and composition of transportation fuels, including the quantity of renewable fuels that must be blended into transportation fuels,\n\u2022public and employee safety and health,\n\u2022permitting,\n\u2022inherently safer technology, and\n\u2022facility security.\nThe specific impact of laws and regulations, and their enforcement, on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas, crude oil and feedstock sources, production processes and subsequent judicial interpretation of such laws and regulations. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations. We may also face liability for personal injury, property damage, natural resource damage or clean-up costs due to alleged contamination and/or exposure to chemicals or other regulated materials, such as various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate, perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorohexane sulfonate, or other per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, benzene, MTBE and petroleum hydrocarbons, at or from our facilities. Such expenditures could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas production activities could result in reductions or delays in U.S. production of crude oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, we do provide gathering, processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by our customers as a result of such operations. Our refineries are also supplied in part with crude oil produced from unconventional oil shale reservoirs. A range of federal, state and local laws and regulations currently govern or, in some cases, prohibit, hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdictions. Stricter laws, regulations and permitting processes may be enacted in the future. For example, President Biden has suspended new oil and gas permitting on public lands and properties, and has proposed modifying royalties to account for climate costs. If these or other federal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing or other oil and gas production activities are enacted or expanded, such efforts could impede oil and gas production, increase producers\u2019 cost of compliance, and result in reduced volumes available for our midstream assets to gather, process and fractionate.\nClimate change and greenhouse gas emission regulation could affect our operations, energy consumption patterns and regulatory obligations, any of which could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) and other emissions are in various phases of consideration, promulgation or implementation. These include actions to develop international, federal, regional or statewide programs, which could require reductions in our greenhouse gas or other emissions, establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for refined products. Requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.\nFor example, in 2017, the California state legislature adopted AB 398, which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 percent reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in SB 32. Compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a market-based credit system. Additionally, the CARB is now exploring the potential for additional greenhouse gas reductions by 2045 via a yet undefined carbon neutrality standard. Other states are proposing, or have already promulgated, low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. If we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers, sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase, we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits, or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRegional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex, subject to change and considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility, legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy. Increasing concerns about climate change and carbon\nintensity have also resulted in societal concerns and a number of international and national measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Additional stricter measures and investor pressure can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition.\nInternational climate change-related efforts, such as the 2015 United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement, may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations. Though the United States had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, President Biden issued an executive order recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement on January 20, 2021. President Biden also issued an Executive Order on climate change in which he announced putting the U.S. on a path to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, economy-wide, by 2050. The Executive Order also calls for the federal government to pause oil and gas leasing on federal lands, reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as quickly as possible, and requires federal permitting decisions to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. In a second Executive Order, President Biden reestablished a working group to develop the social cost of carbon and the social cost of methane. The social cost of carbon and social cost of methane can be used to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed regulations. A higher social cost of carbon could support more stringent greenhouse gas emission regulation.\nThe scope and magnitude of the changes to U.S. climate change strategy under the Biden administration and future administrations, however, remain subject to the passage of legislation and interpretation and action of federal and state regulatory bodies; therefore, the impact to our industry and operations due to greenhouse gas regulation is unknown at this time.\nEnergy assets and companies are subject to increasing environmental and climate-related litigation.\nGovernmental and other entities in various U.S. states have filed lawsuits against coal, gas, oil and petroleum companies, including us. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. Additionally, private plaintiffs and government parties have undertaken efforts to shut down energy assets by challenging operating permits, the validity of easements or the compliance with easement conditions. For example, the Dakota Access Pipeline, in which MPLX has a minority interest, has been subject to litigation in which plaintiffs have challenged the validity of an easement necessary for the operation of the pipeline and demanded a permanent shutdown of the pipeline. There remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these types of proceedings, as well as their potential effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. Such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies.\nWe operate and develop our business with the expectation that regulations and societal sentiment will continue to enable the development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. However, policy decisions relating to the production, refining, transportation, storage and marketing of carbon-based fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups.\nThe approval process for storage and transportation projects has become increasingly challenging, due in part to state and local concerns related to pipelines, negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry, and concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions downstream of pipeline operations. In addition, government disruptions may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business. Our expansion or construction projects may not be completed on schedule (or at all), or at the budgeted cost. We also may be required to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with the design and installation of our facilities due to their location and the surrounding terrain. We may be required to install additional facilities, incur additional capital and operating expenditures, or experience interruptions in or impairments of our operations to the extent that the facilities are not designed or installed correctly.\nMoreover, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if we build a new pipeline, the construction will occur over an extended period of time and we may not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project, if at all. Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely\naffect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results, thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows.\nRegulatory and other requirements concerning the transportation of crude oil and other commodities by rail may cause increases in transportation costs or limit the amount of crude oil that we can transport by rail.\nWe rely on a variety of systems to transport crude oil, including rail. Rail transportation is regulated by federal, state and local authorities. New regulations or changes in existing regulations could result in increased compliance expenditures. For example, in 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued new standards and regulations applicable to crude-by-rail transportation (Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains). These or other regulations that require the reduction of volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail, change the design or standards for rail cars used to transport the crude oil we purchase, change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil, or require any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering North American crude oil by rail could increase the time required to move crude oil from production areas to our refineries, increase the cost of rail transportation and decrease the efficiency of shipments of crude oil by rail within our operations. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nHistoric or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate.\nWe currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. Our operations, including those of MPLX, and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. While an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us, in class-action litigation, large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages. Attorneys general and other government officials have in the past and may in the future pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims, including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages. We are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. If we are not able to successfully defend such litigation, it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition to substantial liability, plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nApproximately 3,771 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of these employees, approximately 192 employees at our St. Paul Park refinery are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which expired on December 31, 2020. Approximately 231 employees at our El Paso refinery are covered by a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in April 2021. Approximately 2,390 employees at our Anacortes, Canton, Catlettsburg, Galveston Bay, Los Angeles, Mandan, Martinez and Salt Lake City refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are due to expire on February 1, 2022. The remaining 958 hourly represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2024. These agreements may be renewed at an increased cost to us. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements. For example, approximately 192 workers at our St. Paul Park refinery have been on strike since January 21, 2021. Any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, California requires refinery owners to pay prevailing wages to contract craft workers and restricts refiners\u2019 ability to hire qualified employees to a limited pool of applicants. Legislation or changes in regulations could result in labor shortages, higher labor costs, and an increased risk that contract workers become joint employees, which could trigger bargaining issues, and wage and benefit consequences, especially during critical maintenance and construction periods.\nOne of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a master limited partnership, which may expose us to certain legal liabilities.\nOne of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of MPLX, a master limited partnership. Our control of the general partner of MPLX may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf foreign investment in us or MPLX exceeds certain levels, MPLX could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels, which could adversely affect MPLX\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including MPC.\nThe Shipping Act of 1916 and Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (collectively, the \u201cMaritime Laws\u201d), generally require that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be owned by U.S. citizens. Among other requirements to establish citizenship, entities that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by U.S. citizens. If we fail to maintain compliance with the Maritime Laws, MPLX would be prohibited from operating vessels in the U.S. inland waters. Such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations could be disrupted if we are unable to maintain or obtain real property rights required for our business.\nWe do not own all of the land on which certain of our assets are located, particularly our midstream assets, but rather obtain the rights to construct and operate such assets on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Therefore, we are subject to the possibility of more burdensome terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if our leases, rights-of-way or other property rights lapse, terminate or are reduced or it is determined that we do not have valid leases, rights-of-way or other property rights. Any loss of or reduction in these rights, including loss or reduction due to legal, governmental or other actions or difficulty renewing leases, right-of-way agreements or permits on satisfactory terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our facilities are located on Native American tribal lands and are subject to various federal and tribal approvals and regulations, which may increase our costs and delay or prevent our efforts to conduct planned operations.\nVarious federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, along with each Native American tribe, regulate natural gas and oil operations on Native American tribal lands, including drilling and production requirements and environmental standards. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These tribal laws and regulations include various taxes, fees, requirements to employ Native American tribal members and other conditions that apply to operators and contractors conducting operations on Native American tribal lands. Persons conducting operations on tribal lands are generally subject to the Native American tribal court system. In addition, if our relationships with any of the relevant Native American tribes were to deteriorate, we could face significant risks to our ability to continue operations on Native American tribal lands. One or more of these factors may increase our cost of doing business on Native American tribal lands and impact the viability of, or prevent or delay our ability to conduct operations on such lands.\nThe Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be, to the extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our shareholders.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of MPC;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of MPC to MPC or its stockholders\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against MPC arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, MPC\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, any Preferred Stock Designation or the Bylaws of MPC; or\n\u2022any other action asserting a claim against MPC or any Director or officer of MPC that is governed by or subject to the internal affairs doctrine for choice of law purposes.\nThe forum selection provision may restrict a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim against us or directors or officers of MPC in a forum that it finds favorable, which may discourage stockholders from bringing such claims at all. Alternatively, if a court were to find the forum selection provision contained in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in another forum, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, the forum selection provision does not apply to any claims, actions or proceedings arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nProvisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company, dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity.\nThe existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u2022providing that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board;\n\u2022providing for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022providing that only our board of directors may fill board vacancies;\n\u2022limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022establishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022providing that our directors may only be removed for cause;\n\u2022authorizing a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us; and\n\u2022authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nFinally, to facilitate compliance with the Maritime Laws, our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by non-U.S. citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares. We may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by non-U.S. citizens to exceed 23 percent. Our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock. These limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to non-U.S. citizens due to the limitations on ownership by non-U.S. citizens. Any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.\nStrategic Transaction Risks\nOur pending sale of Speedway to 7-Eleven is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the Speedway sale could have a material and adverse effect on us. Even if completed, the Speedway sale may not achieve the intended benefits.\nWe have announced our agreement to sell Speedway, our company-owned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business, to 7-Eleven. The sale, which is targeted for completion in the first quarter of 2021, is subject to customary conditions. We and 7-Eleven may be unable to satisfy such conditions to the closing of the sale in a timely manner or at all and, accordingly, the Speedway sale may be delayed or may not be completed. Failure to complete the Speedway sale could have a material and adverse effect on us, including by delaying our strategic and other objectives relating to the separation of Speedway and adversely affecting our plans to use the proceeds from the sale to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our shareholders. Even if the sale is completed, we may not realize some or all the expected benefits. For example, we may be unable to utilize the proceeds from the sale as anticipated or capture the value we expect from our plans to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our shareholders. Executing the Speedway sale will require significant time and attention from management, which could divert attention from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies. If the proposed Speedway sale is completed, our diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and it is possible that our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be subject to increased volatility as a result.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nSignificant stockholders may attempt to effect changes at our company or acquire control over our company, which could impact the pursuit of business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our company. Campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies. As a result, stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture acquisitions will involve the integration of new assets or businesses and may present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses will present potential risks, which may include, among others:\n\u2022inaccurate assumptions about future synergies, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs;\n\u2022an inability to successfully integrate, or a delay in the successful integration of, assets or businesses we acquire;\n\u2022a decrease in our liquidity resulting from using a portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to finance transactions;\n\u2022a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance transactions;\n\u2022the assumption of unknown environmental and other liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022the loss of customers or key employees from the acquired business; and\n\u2022the incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, payroll, franchise, withholding and property taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities, and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties.", "PERMNO": 12872, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "MPC"}
