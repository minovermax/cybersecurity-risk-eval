{"cik": "937098", "company": "TRINET GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous complex laws, and changes in, uncertainty regarding, or adverse application of these laws could negatively affect our business.\nThe products and services we provide to our clients are subject to numerous complex federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those described in Part I, Item 1. Business, of this Form 10-K. Many of these laws (such as ERISA, the ACA, other federal and state employee benefit laws, workers' compensation laws, employment tax laws, worksite safety laws, insurance and banking laws, wage and hour laws, anti-discrimination laws, and laws specific to the industries of our clients) do not specifically address PEOs or co-employment relationships, which can lead to unpredictable application, regulatory interpretation and discretion in enforcement at the federal, state and local levels in relation to our business.\nIn addition, new laws, changes in existing laws, or adverse application or interpretation of new or existing laws, whether they apply to employers generally or specifically to PEOs or our co-employment relationships with our WSEs, could reduce or eliminate the need for, or value and benefit provided by, some or all of the products and services we provide, and/or require us to make significant changes to our methods of doing business and providing products and services, including providing additional customer and WSE disclosures. Any such new laws, changes in laws or adverse application or interpretation of laws could also affect the extent and type of employee benefits employers and co-employers can or must provide employees, the amount and type of taxes employers, co-employers and employees are required to pay, or the time within which employers and co-employers must remit taxes to applicable tax authorities. The laws that apply in our industry and to employers and co-employers have and could be changed, replaced or interpreted in a manner adverse to our operations and we are not able to predict the occurrence, direction or ultimate impact of these events. Any such new laws, change in laws or adverse application or interpretation of laws could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to and continued uncertainty regarding the implementation and future of health care reform in the United States, including under the ACA, any successor to the ACA, or related or similar state and local laws, has the potential to substantially change the health insurance market for SMBs and how such employers provide health insurance to their employees, which could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain our clients. For example, the elimination of the ACA individual mandate tax penalty beginning in 2019 may reduce the number of WSEs who participate in our insurance programs. Significant changes could be made to the ACA in 2019 and beyond, including the potential modification, amendment or repeal of the ACA. Changes to federal health care laws, including the ACA, could also result in new or amended laws being introduced at the state or local level. Our ability to comply with, and adapt our product offerings to take advantage of, any such changes could require significant additional costs and divert management attention, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, changes to federal, state and local laws regarding other traditional employee benefits, such as retirement benefits, also have the potential to substantially change the types of benefit programs that are available to SMBs and that may be offered by PEOs. For example, proposed rule changes by the DOL may make available \"open multiple employer plans\" for retirement benefits, which plans may compete with the benefit plans we provide. The availability of alternative employee benefit plans for SMBs, or any reduction in the types of plans that we can offer our clients, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not recognized as an employer of worksite employees under federal and state regulations, or are deemed to be an insurance agent or third-party administrator, we and our clients could be adversely impacted.\nIn order to sponsor our employee benefit plan offerings for WSEs, we must qualify as an employer of WSEs for certain purposes under the Code and ERISA. In addition, our status as an employer is important for purposes of ERISA\u2019s preemption of certain state laws. The definition of employer under various laws is not uniform, and under both the Code and ERISA, the term is defined in part by complex multi-factor tests.\nGenerally, these tests are designed to evaluate whether an individual is an independent contractor or employee and they provide substantial weight to whether a purported employer has the right to direct and control the details of an individual's work. Some factors that the IRS has considered important in the past in evaluating this issue have included the employer\u2019s degree of behavioral control (for example the extent of instructions, training and evaluation of the work), financial control and the economic aspects of the work relationship, the type of relationship, as evidenced by the specific contract, if any, whether employee benefits are provided, whether the work is indefinite in duration or project-based, and whether it is a regular part of the employer\u2019s business. However, a definitive judicial interpretation of \u201cemployer\u201d in the context of PEOs has not been established. For ERISA purposes, for example, courts have held that test factors relating to the ability to control and supervise an individual are less important, while the DOL has issued guidance that certain entities in the HR outsourcing industry do not qualify as common law employers for ERISA purposes. Although we believe that we qualify as an employer of WSEs under ERISA and the DOL has not provided guidance otherwise, we are not able to predict the outcome of any regulatory challenge.\nIf we were found not to be an employer for ERISA purposes, it could adversely affect the manner in which we are able to provide employee benefits to WSEs. Similarly, to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Code, certain employee benefit plans, such as 401(k) retirement plans and cafeteria plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees. All of our 401(k) retirement plans are operated pursuant to guidance provided by the IRS and we have received favorable determination letters from the IRS confirming the qualified status of these plans. However, the IRS uses its own complex, multi-factor test to ascertain whether an employment relationship exists between a worker and a purported employer. Although we believe that we qualify as an employer of WSEs under the Code, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not challenge our position or continue to provide favorable determination letters. Moreover, the IRS' 401(k) guidance and qualification requirements are not applicable to the operation of our cafeteria plans.\nIf we are not recognized as an employer under the Code or ERISA, we may be required to change the method by which we report and remit payroll taxes to the tax authorities and the method by which we provide, or discontinue providing, certain employee benefits to WSEs. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe must also qualify as co-employers of WSEs and comply with state licensing, certification and registration requirements for the regulation of PEOs. Forty-four states have passed such laws and other states may implement such requirements in the future. While we believe that we satisfy these state regulations, these requirements vary from state to state, they can and have changed frequently with varying degrees of impact on our operations. If we are not able to satisfy existing or future licensing requirements or other applicable regulations in any state, we may be prohibited from doing business in that state, including having any clients within that state.\nIn addition, state regulatory authorities generally impose licensing requirements on companies acting as insurance agents or third-party administrators, such as those that handle health or retirement plan funding and claim processing. We do not believe that our current activities require such licensing, but we and others in our industry have received inquiries from regulatory authorities in the past and could receive them in the future. If regulatory authorities in any state determine that we are acting as an insurance agent, third-party administrator, we may need to hire additional personnel to manage regulatory compliance and pay annual regulatory fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur co-employment relationship with our worksite employees exposes us to business risks.\nWe are the co-employer of our WSEs. As the co-employer of our WSEs, we assume certain risks and obligations of an employer. For instance, we face the risk of providing access to health benefits to our WSEs even if the cost of providing benefits exceeds the fees received from our clients. However, the extent of our responsibility for other aspects of our co-employer relationship with our WSEs remains subject to regulatory uncertainty at the local, state and federal levels. For example, under certain circumstances, we may be found to be responsible for paying salaries, wages and related payroll taxes of our WSEs, even if our clients have not timely remitted payments to us.\nOur WSEs work in our clients' workplaces. Our ability to control the workplace environment of our clients is limited. As a co-employer of WSEs, we may be subject to liability for violations of labor and employment laws, industry-specific laws that apply to the businesses our clients operate, other laws that apply to our clients or to employers generally, and other acts and omissions by our clients or WSEs, even if we do not violate such laws or participate in such acts or omissions. State and federal positions regarding co-employment relationships are in a constant state of flux and have changed with varying degrees of impact on our operations. We cannot predict when changes will occur or forecast whether any particular future changes will be favorable or unfavorable to our operations.\nWe seek to mitigate these risks through agreements and insurance coverage. Our agreements with our clients divide responsibilities between us and our clients and provide that our clients will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or our WSEs' conduct. However, we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect on these obligations. In addition, we maintain insurance coverage, including workers\u2019 compensation and EPLI coverage, to limit our and our clients' exposure to various WSE-related claims, but subject to split by contract, we are still responsible for any deductible layer under such insurance and such insurance generally excludes coverage for claims relating to the classification of employees as exempt or non-exempt, other wage and hour issues, and employment contract disputes, among other things. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us and for which we are unable to obtain indemnification from our clients.\nNegative publicity relating to events or activities attributed to us, our corporate employees, WSEs, or others associated with us, whether or not justified, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. In addition, if our brand is negatively impacted, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, including creating challenges in retaining clients or attracting new clients and hiring and retaining employees.\nCyber-attacks or other security-related incidents could result in reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, regulatory penalties, and damage to our reputation.\nMaintaining the security of our infrastructure and the confidentiality of our clients' and WSEs' personal data and information is paramount for us and our clients. Clients using our technology platform and services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our products and services and the protection of sensitive client and WSE data. We collect, store, use, process, transfer, disclose, and transmit a large amount of personal and confidential information about our clients, WSEs and colleagues, including bank account and social security numbers, data used for tax returns, certain medical information, retirement account information and payroll data. In providing our services, we also rely on third-party service providers, such as insurance carriers and banks, who have access to personal and confidential information about our clients, WSEs and employees and some of those service providers subcontract some of their responsibilities to other third-party service providers. Through contractual provisions and third party risk management processes, we take steps to require that our service providers protect our funds and sensitive information. Due to the size and complexity of our information technology system, the amount of sensitive data that we store and the number of employees and third-party service providers with access to that data, our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to a variety of intentional and inadvertent security threats.\nThreats to our information technology systems and data security can take a variety of forms. Hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our networks and data centers or those of our service providers. Other malicious actors may direct social engineering, phishing, credential stuffing and similar types of attacks against either or both of us and our clients and service providers. Other threats include inadvertent security breaches by our employees, clients, WSEs, service providers and other business partners.\nOrganizations and individuals have launched and will continue to potentially launch such targeted attacks, including social engineering, phishing and credential stuffing attacks, against us, our service providers, and our clients. Such attacks have and can disrupt, or result in unauthorized access to, our networks, applications, bank accounts, and confidential data, or those of our clients or WSEs or service providers. In addition, we, our service providers and our clients have experienced inadvertent security breaches that led to disclosures of sensitive client and WSE data in the past and could have such experiences in the future.\nAny cyber-attack, unauthorized intrusion, insider theft, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service or other data security incident could result in disruption to our systems and services, product development delays, and the disclosure or misuse of personal and confidential information. This could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, result in liability or regulatory sanction or a loss of confidence in our ability to provide our services, or harm our reputation and relationships with current or potential clients. The costs of identifying and remediating any attack, breach, or disclosure, and the costs associated with responding to litigation or regulatory investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reduce our operating margins. Any publicized security problems, or even public rumors about a security problem, affecting our businesses and/or those of our service providers may have a similarly material adverse effect on our business or reputation.\nWe have implemented policy, procedural, technical, physical, and administrative controls with the aim of protecting our networks, applications, bank accounts, and the personal and confidential information entrusted to us from such threats. While we, and our service providers, have security measures and programs in place to prevent, detect, and respond to attacks, data security incidents and other similar threats, these security measures and programs and our collective efforts may not always succeed. Despite our efforts and those of our service providers, we cannot fully eliminate the possibility of such attacks, data security incidents and other threats, whether intentional or inadvertent and whether internal or external and we, our clients or our service providers may not discover a security incident for a significant period of time after the incident occurs. We also expect that intentional threats to our infrastructure and our clients\u2019 and WSEs\u2019 data will continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication. As a result, we are investing, and plan to continue investing, resources to protect our information security ecosystem against such incidents though we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a security incident.\nMaintaining the security of confidential WSE information is particularly important to us as a sponsor of employee benefit plans with access to certain personal health information. The manner in which we manage PHI is subject to HIPAA and the HITECH Act. To the extent possible, the health information we possess is anonymized and accessed through a secured third-party database. Although we maintain, and actively seek to improve, security measures and infrastructure designed to protect against unauthorized access to this sensitive data, cyber-attacks and security breaches remain a significant threat to our business. Any security breach, whether deliberate or inadvertent, could result in the access, public disclosure, loss or theft of our clients' and WSEs' confidential and personal data, including PHI, which could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us, result in reputational damage and subject us to lawsuits, regulatory fines, or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are also subject to various federal, state and foreign laws, rules, and regulations relating to the collection, use, and security of personal and confidential information. For example, U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Canada have enacted breach notification laws that may require us to notify WSEs, clients, employees, or regulators in the event of unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal or confidential information. Complying with these various laws, and with any new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws, could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. For example, we must comply with the requirements of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) by January 1, 2020, which may require us to incur additional costs. Changes or inconsistencies in interpretations of these laws and regulations and/or changes in enforcement priorities may result in significant penalties or liability for non-compliance.\nUnexpected changes in workers' compensation and health insurance claims by worksite employees could harm our business.\nOur insurance costs, which make up a significant portion of our overall costs, are significantly affected by our WSEs\u2019 health and workers' compensation insurance claims experience. We establish accrued costs to provide for the estimated costs of reimbursing our workers' compensation and health insurance carriers under our insurance policies, relying on third-party actuaries and our own experience, but the volume and severity of claims activity is inherently unpredictable. If we experience a sudden or unexpected increase or decrease in claims activity including an increase in WSE incidents or costs of those incidents, our costs could increase or decrease, respectively. An increase in claims activity could make it more difficult to secure replacement insurance policies on competitive terms once our current policies expire. Estimating these accrued costs requires us to consider a number of factors and requires significant judgment. If there is an unexpected increase or decrease in the severity or frequency of claims activity of our WSEs (including activity arising from any of a number of factors that affect claim activity levels, such as changes in general economic conditions, claims differing significantly from expectations, and terrorism, disease outbreaks or other catastrophic events), or if we subsequently receive updated information indicating insurance claims were higher or lower than previously estimated and reported, our insurance costs could be higher or lower, respectively, in that period or subsequent periods as we adjust our accrued costs accordingly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have experienced both favorable and unfavorable insurance cost variability due to claims activity in the past and could have similar or worse experiences in the future.\nSome of our health insurance policies include risk-based policies that can limit our exposure for individual claims and our maximum aggregate claims exposure in each policy year. Refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these policies. We have experienced variability, and may experience variability in the future, in the amounts that we are required to pay for group health insurance expenses incurred by WSEs within our deductible layer under these risk-based policies, based on continually changing trends in the frequency and severity of claims. These historical trends may change, and other seasonal trends and variability may develop, which may make it more difficult for us to manage this aspect of our business and which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur results of operations and stock price may fluctuate as a result of numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nOur future operating results and stock price are subject to fluctuations and quarterly variations based upon a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe volume and severity of health and workers' compensation insurance claims by our WSEs, recorded as part of our insurance costs, and the timing of related claims information provided by our insurance carriers,\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our other insurance costs, operating expenses and capital expenditures,\n\u2022\nthe number of our new clients initiating service and the number of WSEs employed by each new client,\n\u2022\nthe retention, loss or merger of existing clients,\n\u2022\na reduction in the number of WSEs employed by existing clients,\n\u2022\nthe timing of client payments and payment defaults by clients,\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with our acquisitions of companies, assets and technologies,\n\u2022\nany payments or draw downs on our credit facility,\n\u2022\nany unanticipated expenses, such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments,\n\u2022\nany expenses we incur for geographic and service expansion,\n\u2022\nany changes in laws or adverse interpretation of laws, which may require us to change the manner in which we operate and/or increase our regulatory compliance costs,\n\u2022\nany changes in our effective tax rate, and\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements.\nIn addition, the trading price of our common stock is subject to fluctuation in response to a variety of factors, including the factors above and below, many of which are not within our control, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets,\n\u2022\nany trading activity, or a market expectation regarding such activity, by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders,\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole, and its impact on SMBs and our clients,\n\u2022\nthe performance and market perception of companies that investors believe are similar to us, and\n\u2022\nany significant changes in the liquidity of our common stock.\nMany of the above factors are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this Risk Factors section and in Part II, Item 7. MD&A, of this Form 10-K. Many of these factors are outside our control, and the variability and unpredictability of these factors have in the past and could in the future cause us to fail to meet our expectations and the expectations of investors and any industry analysts who cover our shares, which could result in a decline in our share price and reduced liquidity in our shares. In addition, the occurrence of one or more of these factors might cause our results of operations to vary widely, which could lead to negative impacts on our margins, short-term liquidity, and our ability to retain or attract key personnel, and could cause other unanticipated issues, including a downgrade of our shares by or change in opinion of industry analysts and a related decline in our share price.\nAny failure in our business systems, or any third-party business systems or service provider that we rely upon, could reduce the quality of our business services, harm our reputation and expose us to liability.\nOur business is highly dependent on data processing systems that rely on the complex integration of numerous hardware and software subsystems to manage, on a daily basis, a large volume of client and WSE transactions, including the processing of employee, payroll and benefits data. Our systems have and could be disrupted by, among other things, equipment failures, computer server or systems failures, network outages, malicious acts, software errors or defects, vendor performance problems, power failures, natural disasters, terrorist actions or similar events. Any delay or failure in these systems, even if only for a short period of time, can have a significant impact on our clients and WSEs and result in a loss of clients and/or liability to our clients and WSEs or fines and penalties levied by the government agencies that regulate our operations, any of which could result in a materially adverse effect on our reputation and business. For example, errors in our products and services, such as the erroneous denial of healthcare benefits or delays in making payroll, could expose our clients to liability claims from improperly serviced WSEs, for which we may be contractually obligated to provide indemnification.\nIn addition, we rely on third-party systems to provide services for our clients and WSEs, such as electronic banking systems and payroll tax systems that transmit client and WSE data to taxing agencies. If any of these systems were disrupted or if the third parties who provide those systems were to experience operational or financial difficulties even if only for a short period of time, which has happened in the past and could happen in the future, the solutions we provide to our clients and WSEs could be significantly affected, which could also result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. We also rely on enterprise software applications licensed from third parties that are upgraded from time to time. Any difficulties we encounter in adapting application upgrades to our systems could harm our performance, delay or prevent us from providing services to our clients.\nTo succeed, we must constantly improve our technology to meet the expectations of our clients. If we fail to meet those expectations, we may lose clients and harm our business.\nIn order to attract and retain clients and satisfy their expectations, the software, hardware and networking technologies we use must be frequently and rapidly upgraded, enhanced and expanded in response to technological advances, competitive pressures, client expectations, and new and changing laws. As a result, we must timely and effectively identify, develop, or license from third parties, and integrate such upgraded, enhanced or expanded technologies into the solutions that we provide. New products or upgrades may not be released according to schedule, or may contain defects when released. Difficulties in integrating new technologies could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our services, or client claims against us, any of which could materially harm our business. We could also incur substantial costs in modifying our services or infrastructure to adapt to these changes. In addition, we could lose market share if our competitors develop technologically superior products and services.\nWe have remediated the material weakness previously reported in our internal control over financial reporting, but if we fail to properly manage our internal control over financial reporting on a go forward basis, future material weaknesses could be identified that could, if not remediated, result in a material misstatement in our financial statements.\nWe have remediated the material weakness that we previously identified in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 by implementing and enhancing our control procedures. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In order to properly manage our internal control over financial reporting, we may need to take additional measures, including system migration and automation, and we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls will be sufficient to ensure that our internal controls will remain effective and eliminate the possibility that other material weakness or deficiencies may develop or be identified in the future. Implementing any changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees and require expenditures to implement new process or modify our existing processes. If we experience future material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls and we are unable to correct them in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, will be adversely affected. Any such failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, lead to delisting, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe have acquired, and may in the future acquire, other businesses and technologies, which can divert management's attention and create integration risks and other risks for our business.\nWe have completed numerous acquisitions of other businesses and technologies, and we expect that we will continue to pursue future acquisitions. Such acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:\n\u2022\nidentifying attractive acquisition candidates,\n\u2022\nover-valuing and over-paying for acquisition candidates,\n\u2022\nintegrating the operations, systems, technologies, services and personnel of the acquired companies, which may include the migration of WSEs from the technology platform and service providers used by the acquired company to our own,\n\u2022\nestablishing or maintaining internal controls, procedures and policies relating to the acquired systems and processes, including the potential for actual or perceived control weaknesses associated with or arising from the acquisitions and integration of acquired systems,\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns,\n\u2022\nlitigation resulting from activities of the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, clients, former stockholders and other third parties,\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisitions and unanticipated liabilities of the acquired companies,\n\u2022\ninsufficient indemnification or security from the selling parties for legal liabilities that we may assume in connection with our acquisitions,\n\u2022\nentering markets in which we have no prior experience and may not succeed,\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired companies, and\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with clients and employees of the acquired companies or our clients and employees as a result of the integration of acquired operations and new management personnel.\nWe have experienced increased operating costs to resolve the challenges of prior acquisitions. If we fail to appropriately integrate any acquired business, we may fail to achieve our growth, service enhancement or operational efficiency objectives, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may pay for acquisitions by issuing additional shares of our common stock, which would dilute our stockholders, or by issuing debt, which could include terms that restrict our ability to operate our business or pursue other opportunities and subject us to significant debt service obligations. We may also use significant amounts of cash to complete acquisitions. To the extent that we complete acquisitions in the future, we likely will incur future amortization expenses associated with the acquired assets. We may also record significant amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill, which could become impaired in the future. Any such impairment charges would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur SMB clients are particularly affected by volatility in the financial and economic environment, which could harm our business.\nOur clients are small and mid-sized businesses that we believe can be particularly susceptible to changes in the level of overall economic activity in the markets in which we operate. During periods of weak economic conditions, small business failures tend to increase and employment levels tend to decrease. Current or potential clients may react to weak or forecasted weak economic conditions by reducing employee headcount or wages, bonuses or benefits levels, any of which would affect our revenues, and may affect our margins, because we may be unable to reduce our operating expenses sufficiently enough or quickly enough to offset the decrease in revenues. It is difficult to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction, strength and length of economic cycles. These conditions may affect the willingness of our clients and potential clients to pay outside vendors for services like ours, and may impact their ability to pay their obligations to us on time, or at all.\nFor example, as a result of macroeconomic factors, interest rates may become more volatile. Increased interest rate volatility could also negatively impact our clients' and prospects' access to credit. If businesses have difficulty obtaining credit, business growth and new business formation may be impaired, which could also harm our business. Even modest downturns in economic activity on a regional or national level could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business and operations have undergone and will continue to undergo significant change as we seek to improve our operational effectiveness. If we are unable to effectively manage this change, our business and results of operations may suffer.\nWe have significantly changed our operations and internal processes in recent periods in order to improve our operational effectiveness, which has placed a strain on our systems, management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We believe these efforts are important to our long-term success. Managing these changes will continue to require further refinement to our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures while we simultaneously seek to effectively recruit, integrate, train and motivate new corporate employees, retain our existing corporate employees, maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture, effectively execute our business plan, satisfy the requirements of our existing clients, acquire new clients, and enhance the quality and scope of our services. These activities will require significant operating and capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources, which we expect will continue to place significant demands on our management and on our operational and financial infrastructure. If we fail to manage these changes effectively, our costs and expenses may increase more than we expect and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nIf our vertical strategy is unsuccessful, we may not be able to grow our business at the rate that we anticipate.\nWe have developed an industry vertical business strategy and we plan to continue to devote significant resources and time in pursuit of this strategy. Under our industry vertical strategy, our sales force, product development, and service teams are focused on specific business sectors. We cannot assure you that our industry vertical approach will resonate with our existing and prospective clients, that we will target the right industries, that our vertical products will have all of the features most valuable to existing and prospective clients in those industries, or that we will implement our strategy in a timely and effective manner. If our vertical strategy is unsuccessful, our business may not grow at the rate that we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to train and manage our sales force effectively, our business may be harmed.\nWe have experienced sales force attrition in the past and we rely on a well-trained sales force to promote our industry vertical strategy and sell our solutions. Competition for skilled sales personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting, training and retaining qualified sales personnel, or that any newly hired sales personnel will function effectively either individually or as a group. In addition, newly hired sales personnel are typically not productive for some period of time following their hiring, which results in increased near-term costs to us relative to their actual sales contributions during this period. If we are unable to effectively train our sales force and benefit from greater productivity of our sales representatives, or if our sales force is otherwise unable to sell our solutions as we anticipate, our revenues likely will not increase at the rate that we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reputation could suffer and our business could be adversely affected if our products do not perform, and our services are not delivered, as expected by our clients and WSEs.\nIn order to attract and retain clients, we believe that we must compete in our industry effectively on the basis of the value proposition that we deliver to our clients including customer experience and satisfaction, breadth and depth of our benefit plans, vertical market expertise, total cost of service, brand awareness and reputation, ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly, access to online and mobile solutions, and subject matter expertise. The expectations of our clients and prospective clients in these areas change over time as a result of many factors outside of our control, such as competition, regulatory and technical changes, and changing trends in the demands employees place on SMB employers. If we are unable to continually satisfy the evolving product and service delivery expectations of our clients and WSEs, then we could experience greater rates of attrition and lower rates for on-boarding new clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are capable of satisfying client expectations in these areas, we may not be able to do so on a cost-effective basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations.\nMost of our clients are concentrated in certain geographic regions and a relatively small number of industries, making us vulnerable to downturns in those geographies and industries.\nMost of our clients are concentrated in certain geographic regions and operate in a relatively small number of industries, including the technology, life sciences, not-for-profit, professional services and financial services industries. As a result, if any of those geographic regions or specific industries suffers a downturn, the portion of our business attributable to clients in that region or industry could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business. Refer to Note 8 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for additional information about the legal proceedings we are currently involved in and future proceedings that we may face. Current and future legal proceedings may result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nChanges in our income tax positions or adverse outcomes resulting from on-going or future tax audits could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nSignificant judgments and estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows may be impacted if any of our tax positions are challenged and successfully disputed by the tax authorities. In determining the adequacy of our tax provision, we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes that could result if our tax positions were challenged by the IRS and other tax authorities. The tax authorities in the U.S. regularly examine our income and other tax returns. Refer to Note 10 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for additional details regarding our on-going tax examinations and disputes. The ultimate outcome of tax examinations and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the IRS or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of these or other examinations, we may be required to record charges to operations that could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nAdverse changes in our insurance coverage, or in our relationships with key insurance carriers, could harm our business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain competitive health and workers' compensation coverage options and insurance rates through well-known insurance carriers. If we are unable to maintain competitive insurance rates or obtain popular and desirable coverage plans through well-known insurance carriers, it could affect our ability to attract and retain clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Where we sponsor insurance coverage and we are not responsible for any deductibles, our carriers set the premiums and the rates set by our carriers on these policies may not be competitive. Even where we sponsor insurance under which we are responsible for deductibles, we may not be able to control costs through the deductible layer in a way that would make our rates competitive.\nIn addition, broad adoption of our services in certain geographic regions or industries may make it more difficult for us to obtain competitive health and/or workers' compensation insurance rates due to concentration of clients within a particular region or industry. The loss of any one or more of our key insurance vendors in these areas, or our inability to partner with certain vendors that are better-known or more desirable to our clients or potential clients, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is significant competition for our clients and clients may terminate our services based on a variety of factors, many of which are difficult for us to control, which can negatively impact our business.\nWe regularly experience client attrition due to a variety of factors that are difficult for us to control, including cost pressures, client merger and acquisition activity, increases in administrative and insurance service fees, client business failure, effects of competition, and client decisions to bring their HR administration in-house. Our standard client service agreement can be canceled by us or by the client without penalty with 30 days\u2019 prior written notice. Clients who intend to cease doing business with us often elect to do so effective as of the beginning of a calendar year. As a result, we have historically experienced our largest concentration of client attrition in the first quarter of each year. In addition, we experience higher levels of client attrition in connection with renewals of the health insurance coverage we sponsor for WSEs in the event that such renewals result in increased costs. If we were to experience client attrition in excess of our historic annual attrition rate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe terms of our credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, which would impair our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our business.\nOur credit facility contains, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us subject to customary exceptions, including restricting our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur, assume or guarantee additional debt,\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock,\n\u2022\nincur or assume liens,\n\u2022\nmake loans, investments and acquisitions,\n\u2022\nengage in sales of assets and subsidiary stock,\n\u2022\nenter into sale-leaseback transactions,\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates,\n\u2022\nenter into certain hedging agreements,\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business,\n\u2022\nprepay certain indebtedness,\n\u2022\ntransfer all or substantially all of our assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions with another person, and\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that prohibit the incurrence of liens or the payment by our subsidiaries of dividends and distributions.\nOur failure to comply with these restrictions and the other terms and conditions under our credit facility could result in a default, which in turn could result in the termination of the lenders\u2019 commitments to extend further credit to us under our credit facility and acceleration of a substantial portion of our indebtedness then outstanding under our credit facility. If that were to happen, we may not be able to repay all of the amounts that would become due under our indebtedness or refinance our debt, which could materially harm our business and force us to seek bankruptcy protection.\nAtairos, our largest stockholder, may have significant influence over our Company, and the ownership of capital stock, and thus the voting control, of our Company remains concentrated in our executive officers, directors and their affiliates, which limits your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOn February 1, 2017, an entity affiliated with Atairos Group, Inc. (together with its affiliates, \u201cAtairos\u201d) became our largest stockholder when it acquired the shares of TriNet common stock previously held by General Atlantic. In connection with this transaction, we appointed Michael J. Angelakis, the Chairman and CEO of Atairos, to our board of directors and agreed to nominate Mr. Angelakis or another designee of Atairos reasonably acceptable to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for election at future annual meetings until Atairos\u2019 beneficial ownership falls below 15% of our common stock. As of February 7, 2019, Atairos beneficially owned approximately 28% of our outstanding common stock, and all of our directors, executive officers and their affiliates, including Atairos, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 37% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, of the foregoing, Atairos, particularly when acting with our executive officers, directors and their affiliates, will be able to exert substantial influence on all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or improve our results of operations.\nWe face significant competition on a national and regional level from other PEOs, as well as other existing, and potential, companies and industries that service, or may in the future service, client HR needs. Refer to the heading \u201cCompetition\u201d under Part I, Item 1. Business, above for more details. Our competitors, regardless of industry, may have greater marketing and financial resources than we have, and may be better positioned than we are in certain markets. Increased competition in our industry could result in price reductions or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business. We expect that we will continue to experience competitive pricing pressure.\nMoreover, we may not be successful in convincing potential clients that the use of our services is a superior, cost-effective means of satisfying their HR obligations relative to the way in which they currently satisfy these obligations either by themselves or by using the services of our competitors. If we cannot compete effectively against other PEOs or against the alternative means by which companies meet their HR obligations, or if we are unable to convince clients or potential clients of the advantages of our offerings, our market share and business may suffer, resulting in a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14521, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "TNET"}
