Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. These risks and uncertainties represent some of the more critical risk factors that affect us, as well as the other information that has been provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK. Our business operations or actual results could also be similarly impacted by additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial to our operations.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Customers and Contracts\nDemand for many of our services is impacted by the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production industry.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 76% and 75%, respectively, of our operating revenues were generated by our services, including search and rescue services, to companies primarily engaged in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production activities. As a result, demand for our services, as well as our revenue, profitability and results of operations, are significantly impacted by levels of activity in those sectors. These levels of activity have historically been volatile and the volatility is likely to continue in future periods. In addition to the volatility, these levels are subject to factors that we cannot predict and that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nprevailing oil and gas prices and expectations about future prices and price volatility;\n\u2022\nactions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producing countries to control prices or change production levels;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nassessments of offshore drilling prospects compared with land-based opportunities that do not generally require our services;\n\u2022\nthe costs of exploration, production and delivery of oil and natural gas offshore;\n\u2022\nglobal supply and demand for the oil and gas markets and expectations about future supply and demand;\n\u2022\navailability and rates of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas;\n\u2022\nfederal, state, local and international political conditions, and policies including those with respect to local content requirements and the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\ntechnological advancements affecting exploration, development and production of oil and gas and energy consumption;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation;\n\u2022\nregulation of drilling activities and the availability of drilling permits and concessions and environmental regulation; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and natural gas companies to generate or otherwise obtain funds for offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production and their capital expenditures budgets.\nWe are in a cyclical business.\nOur industry has historically been cyclical and is affected by the volatility of oil and gas price levels, fluctuations in government programs and spending and general economic conditions. Changes in commodity prices can have a significant effect on demand for our services, and periods of low activity intensify price competition in the industry and could result in our helicopters being idle for long periods of time. A prolonged significant downturn in oil and natural gas prices or increased regulation containing onerous compliance requirements is likely to cause a substantial decline in expenditures for exploration, development and production activity, which would result in a decline in demand and lower rates for our services. Similarly, the government agencies with which we do business could face budget cuts or limit spending, which would also result in a decline in demand and lower rates for our services. These changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on relatively few customers, some of which are our affiliates, for a significant share of our revenues, the loss of any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of oil and gas exploration, development and production companies and government agencies. Specifically, services provided to Anadarko, BSEE, Shell, and Williams accounted for 26%, 10%, 6% and 6% of our revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The portion of our revenues attributable to any single customer may change over time, depending on the level of activity by any such customer, our ability to meet the customer\u2019s needs and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The loss or reduction of business from any\nof our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nFurther, to the extent any of our customers or the customers of companies to whom we dry-lease helicopters experience an extended period of operational or financial difficulty, our revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Aer\u00f3leo, our Brazilian joint venture and dry-lease customer, experienced financial difficulties as a result of certain of its helicopters that were dry-leased from us remaining idle for extended period of time. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Due to the resulting liquidity issues experienced by Aer\u00f3leo, we, together with our partner, contributed $9.2 million of additional debt capital to Aer\u00f3leo to enable it to continue operating in September 2012. Another Aer\u00f3leo customer, OGX, experienced financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy protection. These financial difficulties could impair OGX\u2019s ability to pay its receivables to Aer\u00f3leo, which could, in turn, impair Aer\u00f3leo\u2019s ability to make its dry-lease payments owed to us and impact our revenue. As a result of these financial difficulties, we currently recognize revenues from Aer\u00f3leo only as cash is received and as of December 31, 2014, we had deferred recognition of $31.0 million of revenues from Aer\u00f3leo. If Aer\u00f3leo requires additional capital contributions, it could also affect our liquidity. Further, to the extent we do not collect receivables owed to us from Aer\u00f3leo or earn less revenues from the relationship than anticipated, our results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nConsolidation of our customer base could adversely affect demand for our services and reduce our revenues.\nMany of our customers are international, major integrated or independent oil and gas exploration, development and production companies. In recent years, these companies have undergone substantial consolidation, and additional consolidation is possible. Consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for our services, and in the event one of our customers combines with a company that is using the services of one of our competitors, the combined company could decide to use the services of that competitor or another provider. Further, merger activity among both major and independent oil and natural gas companies affects exploration, development and production activity as the consolidated companies often put projects on hold while integrating operations. Consolidation may also result in an exploration and development budget for a combined company that is lower than the total budget of both companies before consolidation. Reductions in the budgets of oil and gas companies could adversely affect demand for our services that could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers include U.S. government agencies that are dependent on budget appropriations, which may fluctuate and, as a result, limit their ability to use our services.\nU.S. government agencies, consisting primarily of BSEE, are among our key customers and accounted for 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. Government agencies receive funding through budget appropriations, which are determined through the political process, and as a result, funding for the agencies with which we do business may fluctuate. There has been increased Congressional scrutiny of discretionary program spending by the U.S. government in light of concerns over the size of the national debt and lawmakers have discussed the need to cut or impose caps on discretionary spending in coming years, which could mean budget cuts to federal agencies to which we provide services. If any of these agencies, and in particular BSEE, experience reductions in their budgets or if they change their spending priorities, their ability or willingness to spend on helicopter services may decline, and they may substantially reduce or cease using our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe implementation by our customers of cost-saving measures could reduce the demand for our services.\nOil and gas companies are continually seeking to implement measures aimed at cost savings, especially during times of depressed pricing such as the one we are currently experiencing. These measures can include efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce costs by reducing headcount or finding less expensive means for moving personnel offshore. Reducing headcount, changing rotations for personnel working offshore, therefore requiring fewer trips to and from installations are some, but not all, of the possible initiatives that could result in reduced demand for our helicopter transport services. In addition, customers could establish their own helicopter operations or utilize other transportation alternatives, such as marine transport. The continued implementation of these kinds of measures could reduce the demand for helicopter services provided by independent operators like us, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is subject to intense competition.\nThe helicopter industry is highly competitive. Contracting for helicopter services is often done through a competitive bidding process among those operators having an acceptable safety record, demonstrated reliability, requisite equipment for the job and sufficient resources to provide coverage when primary equipment comes out of service for maintenance. Customers typically make their final choice based on aircraft availability, quality and location of facilities and price. If we were unable to satisfy the criteria to participate in bids, we would be unable to compete effectively and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn certain of our international markets where foreign regulations may require that contracts be awarded to local companies owned or controlled by nationals, we participate in bids as a subcontractor or vendor to the local bidding company. These third parties may not be able to win these bids for reasons unrelated to us, our safety record, reliability, or equipment. Accordingly, we may lose potential business, which may be significant, for reasons beyond our control.\nWe compete against a number of helicopter operators, including other major global helicopter operators such as Bristow and CHC Group Ltd. In the U.S., we face competition for business in the oil and gas industry from three major operators: Bristow, PHI and Rotorcraft Leasing Company, LLC. In our international markets, we also face competition from local operators in countries where foreign regulations may require that contracts be awarded to local companies owned or controlled by nationals or from operators that are more recognized in some of those markets. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not be successful in capturing a share of our present or potential customer base. We also face potential competition from customers that establish their own flight departments and smaller operators with access to capital that can expand their fleets and operate more sophisticated and costly equipment. In providing air medical transport services, we face competition from Air Medical Group Holdings, Air Methods Corporation, PHI and many other operators. In addition, helicopter leasing companies, such as Lease Corporation International (Aviation) Limited, Macquarie Rotocraft Leasing, Milestone Aviation Group and Waypoint Leasing, provide offerings which compete with, and could capture a share of our, dry-leasing opportunities to third parties. Further, in January 2015, Milestone Aviation Group was acquired by GE Capital Aviation Services, a company with significant resources. We also compete with other providers of medical air transport, search and rescue, utility and flightseeing services in various markets.\nA significant portion of our business is obtained by competitive bid or other competitive process which often require us to expend significant resources with no guaranty of recoupment.\nChartering of helicopters is often done through an aggressive competitive bidding process and intense negotiations. Customers typically make their final choice based on the best price for the required helicopter model that is available within the time frame mandated by their needs. Successfully competing in competitive bidding situations subjects us to risks associated with the substantial time, money, and effort, including proposal development and marketing activities, required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us.\nDue to the intense competition in our markets and increasing customer demand for shorter delivery periods, even in cases where we not involved in a competitive bidding process, we might be required to begin implementation of a project before the corresponding order has been finalized. If we do not succeed in securing an opportunity or winning a bid, we may obtain little or no benefit from the expenditures associated with pursuing them, we may not be able to recoup them on future projects and may have to write them off.\nOur contracts generally can be terminated or downsized by our customers without penalty.\nMany of our operating contracts and charter arrangements in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Alaska contain provisions permitting early termination by the customer for any reason, generally without penalty, and with limited notice requirements. In addition, many of our contracts do not commit our customers to acquire specific amounts of services and permit them to decrease the number of helicopters under contract with a corresponding decrease in the fixed monthly payments without penalty. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on our customer contracts or the terms of those contracts. The termination of contracts by our significant customers or the decrease in their usage of our helicopter services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers may shift risk to us.\nWe give to and receive from our customers indemnities relating to damages caused or sustained by us in connection with our operations. Our customers\u2019 changing views on risk allocation may cause us to accept greater risk to win new business or may result in our losing business if we are not prepared to take such risks. To the extent that we accept such additional risk, and seek to insure against it, if possible, our insurance premiums could rise. If we cannot insure against such risks or otherwise choose not to do so, we could be exposed to catastrophic losses in the event such risks are realized.\nOur fixed operating expenses and long-term customer contracts could adversely affect our business under certain circumstances.\nOur profitability is directly related to demand for our services. A significant portion of our operating expenses are related to crew wages and benefits, insurance and maintenance programs, and are therefore fixed and must be paid even when our helicopters are not actively servicing customers and generating income. A decrease in our revenues could therefore result in a disproportionate decrease in our earnings, as a substantial portion of our operating expenses would remain unchanged. Similarly, the discontinuation of any rebates, discounts or preferential financing terms offered to us by manufacturers or suppliers would have the effect of increasing our fixed expenses, and without a corresponding increase in our revenues, would negatively impact our results of operations.\nIncreases in supplier costs, fuel costs, labor costs, insurance costs, and other costs are typically passed through to our customers through rate increases where possible, including as a component of contract escalation charges. However, certain of our contracts are long-term in nature and may not have escalation or escalation may be tied to an index, which may not increase as rapidly as the associated costs. As a result, these escalations may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup increased costs in full thereby resulting in lower margins. There can be no assurance that we will be able to estimate costs accurately or recover increased costs by passing these costs on to our customers. We may not be successful in identifying or securing cost escalations for other costs that may escalate during the applicable customer contract term. In the event that we are unable to fully recover material costs that escalate during the terms of our customer contracts, the profitability of our client contracts and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nSignificant increases in fuel costs can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuel is essential to the operation of our helicopters and to our ability to carry out our transport services and is a key component of our operating expenses. High fuel costs can increase the cost of operating our helicopters. Any increased fuel costs may negatively impact our net sales, margins, operating expenses and results of operations. Although we have been able to pass along a significant portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past, we cannot assure you that we can do so again if another prolonged period of high fuel costs occurs. To the extent there is a significant increase in fuel costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Operations\nOur operations involve a degree of inherent risk that may not be covered by our insurance or may increase our costs.\nThe operation of helicopters is subject to various risks, including catastrophic disasters, crashes, collisions, adverse weather conditions, mechanical failures and damage to our facility or spare parts, which may result in loss of life, personal injury and/or damage to property and equipment and the suspension or reduction of our operations. Our helicopters have been involved in accidents in the past, some of which included loss of life, personal injury and property damage. We, or third parties operating our helicopters, may experience accidents or damage to our assets in the future. These risks could endanger the safety of both our own and our customers\u2019 personnel, equipment, cargo and other property, as well as the environment. If any of these events were to occur with equipment that we operate or dry-lease to third parties, we could experience loss of revenues, termination of charter contracts, higher insurance rates and damage to our reputation and customer relationships. In addition, to the extent an accident occurs with a helicopter we operate or by assets supporting our operations, we could be held liable for resulting damages. The occurrence of any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf other operators experience accidents or safety issues with a particular model of helicopter that we operate or dry-lease resulting in a customer refusing to use that particular helicopter model due to a loss in confidence for that model by our customers, their employees or the unions to which our customer\u2019s employees belong, a regulatory body grounding that particular helicopter or our taking such helicopter model out of service until the cause of the accident or concern is adequately addressed, we may experience a reduction of revenues and a loss of customers. While we seek to mitigate the financial impact of such risks and preserve our rights through commercial and other arrangements with all those involved, these mitigation efforts may not be successful or available for all incidents. Our financial condition and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period as a result of such incidents and our mitigation efforts. In addition, the value of such helicopter model might also be permanently reduced in the market if the model were to be considered less desirable for future service.\nCertain models of helicopters that we operate or dry-lease have experienced accidents while operated by third parties. For instance, there were two ditchings involving the EC225 helicopter, including one under dry-lease from us to one of our customers and one owned and operated by another helicopter company, which led major global operators to indefinitely suspend EC225 helicopter operations in October 2012 during the lengthy investigation and subsequent corrective action by the manufacturer. After the manufacturer of the EC225 helicopter, Airbus Helicopters (formerly Eurocopter), a division of European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, identified the root cause of the EC225 helicopter service failures and implemented engineering solutions, prevention and detection measures to remedy the matters that led to the suspension that were approved by the European Aviation Safety Agency regulatory authority in July 2013, the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority and the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway lifted operational restrictions, facilitating the return to service of the EC225 helicopter thereafter on a worldwide basis.\nOur Brazilian joint venture and dry-lease customer, Aer\u00f3leo, experienced financial difficulties resulting from both an incident with an AW139 helicopter operated by a competitor and the extended global suspension of the EC225 helicopter described above (see further discussion in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2014, we had deferred the recognition of $31.0 million million of revenues owed to us by Aer\u00f3leo. Should Aer\u00f3leo be unable to fully recover the amount of the suspended payments or encounter any additional financial challenges,\nit may impede Aer\u00f3leo\u2019s ability to pay for the equipment leased from us, necessitate an infusion of capital to allow Aer\u00f3leo to operate and adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe carry insurance, including hull and liability, liability and war risk, general liability, workers\u2019 compensation and other insurance customary in the industry in which we operate. Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and maximum coverage amounts. Our insurance policies are also subject to compliance with certain conditions, the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy. We cannot ensure that our existing coverage will be sufficient to protect against all potential liabilities or the total amount of insured claims and liabilities, that we will be able to maintain our existing coverage in the future, or that our existing coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates without a substantial increase in premiums. Even in cases where insurance covers the costs of repair due to damage to a helicopter, there may be diminution in the value of the helicopter as result of its being less desirable for future service that is likely not covered by insurance. Furthermore, we are not insured for loss of profit, loss of use of our helicopters, business interruption or loss of flight hours. The loss of, or limited availability of, our liability insurance coverage, inadequate coverage from our liability insurance or substantial increases in future premiums could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain an acceptable safety record may have an adverse impact on our ability to obtain and retain customers.\nOur customers consider safety and reliability as the two primary attributes in selecting a helicopter service provider. We must maintain a record of safety and reliability that is acceptable to, and in certain instances is contractually required by, our customers. In an effort to maintain an appropriate standard, we incur considerable costs to maintain the quality of our safety and training programs and our fleet of helicopters. For example, we have implemented a safety program that includes, among many other features, (i) transition and recurrent training using flight training devices, (ii) an FAA approved flight operational quality assurance program and (iii) HUMS, which automatically monitors and reports on vibrations and other anomalies on key components of certain helicopters in our fleet. In addition, many of our customers regularly conduct audits of our operations and safety programs. We cannot assure you that our safety program or our other efforts will provide an adequate level of safety or an acceptable safety record. If we fail to maintain standards of safety and reliability that are satisfactory to our customers, our ability to retain current customers and attract new customers may be adversely affected. Moreover, helicopter crashes or similar disasters of another helicopter operator could impact customer confidence and lead to a reduction in customer contracts or result in the grounding of our helicopters, particularly if such helicopter crash or disaster were due to a safety fault in a type of helicopter used in our fleet. In addition, the loss of any helicopter as a result of an accident could cause significant adverse publicity and the interruption of services to our customers, which could adversely impact our reputation, operations and financial results. Our helicopters have been involved in accidents in the past, some of which have included loss of life and property damage. We may experience similar accidents in the future.\nWe may not be able to obtain work on acceptable terms covering some of our new helicopters, and some of our new helicopters may replace existing helicopters already under contract, which could adversely affect the utilization of our existing fleet.\nWe have on order and have options to order a substantial number of new helicopters. As of December 31, 2014, we had placed orders for 19 new helicopters and have options to purchase an additional 16 helicopters. Of the helicopters on order, seven are scheduled to be delivered in 2015, five are scheduled to be delivered in 2016, and two are scheduled to be delivered in 2017. Delivery dates for the remaining five helicopters have yet to be determined. Many of our new helicopters may not be covered by customer contracts when they are placed into service, and we cannot assure you as to when we will be able to utilize these new helicopters or on what terms. To the extent our helicopters are covered by a customer contract, many of these contracts are short-term, requiring us to seek renewals frequently. Once a new helicopter is delivered to us, we generally spend between two and three months to install equipment and configure the helicopter to our specifications before we place it into service. As a result, there can be a significant delay between the delivery date for a new helicopter and the time that it is able to generate revenues for us. We also expect that some of our customers may request new helicopters in lieu of our existing helicopters, which could adversely affect the utilization of our existing fleet.\nOur dependence on a small number of helicopter manufacturers poses a significant risk to our business and prospects.\nAlthough our fleet includes equipment from all four of the major helicopter manufacturers, our current fleet expansion and replacement needs rely on three manufacturers. If any of the manufacturers with whom we contract face production delays due to, for example, natural disasters, labor strikes or unavailability of skilled labor, we may experience a significant delay in the delivery of previously ordered helicopters. During these periods, we may not be able to obtain additional helicopters with acceptable pricing, delivery dates or other terms. Delivery delays or our inability to obtain acceptable helicopters would adversely affect our revenues and profitability and could jeopardize our ability to meet the demands of our customers and execute our growth strategy. Furthermore, regulatory authorities may require us to temporarily or permanently remove certain helicopter models from service\nfollowing certain incidents or accidents. The lack of availability of new helicopters resulting from a backlog in orders or unavailability of certain helicopter models for service could result in an increase in prices for certain types of used helicopters.\nA shortfall in availability of aircraft components, parts and subsystems required for maintenance and repairs of our helicopters and supplier cost increases could adversely affect us.\nIn connection with the required routine repairs and maintenance that we perform or are performed by others on our helicopters, we rely on seven key vendors (Agusta Aerospace Corporation, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, Airbus Helicopters Inc., Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., Pratt and Whitney Canada, Turbomeca USA, Inc. and Honeywell International) for the supply and overhaul of components on our helicopters. Consolidations involving suppliers could further reduce the number of alternative suppliers for us and increase the cost of components. These vendors have historically been the manufacturers of helicopter components and parts, and their factories tend to work at or near full capacity supporting the helicopter production lines for new equipment. This leaves little capacity for the production of parts requirements for maintenance of our helicopters. The tight production schedules, as well as new regulatory requirements, the availability of raw materials or commodities, or the need to upgrade parts or product recalls can add to backlogs, resulting in key parts being in limited supply or available on an allocation basis. To the extent that these suppliers also supply parts for helicopters used by the U.S. military, parts delivery for our helicopters may be delayed during periods in which there are high levels of military operations. Our inability to perform timely repair and maintenance could result in our helicopters being underutilized and cause us to lose opportunities with existing or potential customers, each of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Furthermore, our operations in remote locations, where delivery of these components and parts could take a significant period of time, may also impact our ability to repair and maintain our helicopters. Although every effort is made to mitigate such impact, this may pose a risk to our results of operations. In addition, supplier cost increases for critical helicopter components and parts can also adversely impact our results of operations. Cost increases are passed on to our customers through rate increases where possible, including as a component of contract escalation charges. However, as certain of our contracts are long-term in nature and may not have escalation or escalation may be tied to an index, which may not increase as rapidly as the cost of parts, we may see our margins erode. In addition, as many of our helicopters are manufactured by two European based companies, the cost of spare parts could be impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.\nAdditionally, operation of our fleet requires us to carry spare parts inventory to perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance activity. Changes in the aircraft model types of our fleet can result in inventory levels in excess of those required to support the fleet over the remaining life of the fleet. Additionally, other parts may become obsolete or dormant given changes in use of parts on aircraft and maintenance needs. These fleet changes or other external factors can result in impairment of inventory balances where we expect that excess, dormant or obsolete inventory will not recover its carrying value through sales to third parties or disposal.\nOur operations depend on facilities we use throughout the world that are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production.\nOur facilities could be damaged or our operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strike, war, political unrest, terrorist activity or a pandemic. We operate numerous bases in and along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and we are particularly exposed to risk of loss or damage from hurricanes in that region. In addition, our operations in Alaska (including our FBO business at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport) are at risk from earthquake activity. In particular, we have fuel tanks at our FBO facility with approximately 200,000 gallons of fuel storage capacity that could be substantially damaged or compromised due to an earthquake. Although we have obtained property damage insurance, a major catastrophe such as a hurricane, earthquake or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, war or terrorist activities in any of the areas where we conduct operations, could result in a prolonged interruption or stoppage of our business or material sub-parts of it. Any disruption resulting from these events could result in a cause the loss of sales and customers. Our insurance may not adequately compensate us for any of these events, and, if not so covered, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on the secondary used aircraft market to dispose of our older aircraft and parts due to our on-going fleet modernization efforts.\nWe manage our fleet by evaluating expected demand for helicopter services across global markets, including the type of aircraft needed to meet this demand. As offshore oil and gas drilling and production globally moves to deeper water, more heavy and medium aircraft and newer technology aircraft may be required. As helicopters come off of current contracts or are replaced by newer models, our management evaluates our future needs for such helicopters against our ability to recover our remaining investments in these aircraft through sales into the aftermarket. We are dependent upon the secondary used helicopter and parts market to dispose of our helicopters as our fleet continues to evolve to address changes in demand driven by customer needs.\nThe book value of our owned helicopters as reflected on our balance sheet is based on our practice of depreciating our helicopters over their expected useful life to the expected salvage value to be received for such helicopter at the end of that life. From time to time, we disclose our net asset value, which is based, in large part, on the fair market value of our helicopters derived\nfrom a combination of available market data, utilization of estimates, application of significant judgment and assistance of valuation specialists, including values obtained from third party analysts. There is no assurance that either the book value, net asset value or the fair market value of any helicopter represents the amount that we could obtain from an unaffiliated third party in an arm\u2019s length sale of the aircraft, and market factors will impact whether we record gains or losses on aircraft sales and whether we are able to achieve the estimated fair market value of such aircraft. The number of helicopter sales and the amount of gains and losses recorded on these sales is unpredictable. A failure to dispose of helicopters and parts in the secondary market could impair our ability to operate our fleet efficiently and service existing contracts or win new opportunities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe derive revenue from non-wholly owned entities. If we are unable to maintain good relations with the other owners of such non-wholly owned entities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLocal regulatory requirements may require us to conduct our international operations through entities in which we have a noncontrolling investment, through strategic alliances with foreign partners or through non-wholly owned entities with local shareholders. We derive significant amounts of revenue from these entities. Approximately 5% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 was from Aer\u00f3leo, our dry-lease customer and a Brazilian joint venture in which we hold 20% of the voting interests and 50% of the economic interests. Due to the financial difficulties experienced by Aer\u00f3leo, we recognize revenues from Aer\u00f3leo as cash is received, and as of December 31, 2014, we had deferred $31.0 million of revenues. To operate helicopters in Brazil, an operator must be licensed by the local regulatory authority. Under applicable Brazilian law, in order to maintain its license, an operator must be \u201ccontrolled\u201d by nationals of Brazil. By \u201ccontrol\u201d, Brazilian aviation legislation refers to holding of at least 80% of operator\u2019s voting shares. We believe that the majority holder of voting shares in Aer\u00f3leo is a Brazilian national and therefore this subsidiary is currently \u201ccontrolled\u201d within the meaning of Brazil licensing requirements. Any change in the national status of the majority shareholder in Aer\u00f3leo could affect the operating licenses of Aer\u00f3leo. We depend to some extent upon good relations with our local shareholders to ensure profitable operations. These shareholders may have interests that are not always aligned with ours and may not be required to provide any funding that these entities may require. Furthermore, certain shareholders\u2019 agreements with local shareholders contain call arrangements which allow the local shareholder to elect to purchase our shares and/or require us to bear all of the losses of these entities. The calls are exercisable in certain circumstances, including liquidation and events of default. In the event shareholder disputes arise or we lose our interest in these entities and/or find other local partners, this could negatively impact our revenues and profit sharing from these entities, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon the level of activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, which are mature exploration and production regions.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our operating revenues derived from services provided to customers primarily engaged in oil and gas activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico represented approximately 67% and 60%, respectively, and in Alaska represented approximately 8% and 13%, respectively, of our total operating revenues. The U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Alaska are mature exploration and production regions that have undergone substantial seismic survey and exploration activity for many years. We cannot predict the levels of activity in these areas. A large number of oil and gas properties in these regions have already been drilled and additional prospects of sufficient size and quality could be more difficult to identify. Generally, the production from these mature oil and gas properties is declining and future production may decline to the point that such properties are no longer economically viable to operate and our services with respect to such properties may no longer be needed. Oil and gas companies may not identify sufficient additional drilling sites to replace those that become depleted. If activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in either the U.S. Gulf of Mexico or Alaska materially declines, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico were adversely impacted by the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig incident and resulting oil spill and any significant development impacting deepwater drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico would adversely affect us.\nWe are highly dependent on offshore oil and gas activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As a result of the well-publicized sinking of the Deepwater Horizon, a semi-submersible deepwater drilling rig operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico after an apparent blowout and fire resulting in a significant flow of hydrocarbons from the BP Plc. (\u201cBP\u201d) Macondo well, the U.S. Department of Interior imposed a moratorium on offshore drilling operations. Drilling resumed in November 2010 but activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico did not reach pre-blowout levels until September 2011. As a result of the blowout at the BP Macondo well and subsequent moratorium on drilling activities, our operating results were adversely affected in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first half of 2011. In addition, as a result of the blowout, the U.S. Department of Interior issued new rules designed to improve drilling and workplace safety in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and various congressional committees began pursuing legislation to regulate drilling activities and increase liability. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BSEE and Office of National Resources Revenue are expected to continue to issue new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and other regulatory agencies could potentially issue new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations in other geographic regions, and may take other steps that could increase the costs of exploration, development and production, reduce the area of operations and result in permitting delays. We are monitoring legislation and regulatory developments; however, it is difficult to\npredict the ultimate impact of any new guidelines, regulations or legislation. A prolonged suspension of drilling activity or permitting delays in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, new regulations and/or increased liability for companies operating in this sector, whether or not caused by a new incident in the region, could result in reduced demand for our services, and reduced cash flows and profitability.\nOur future growth may be impacted by our ability to expand into markets outside of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Alaska.\nOur future growth will depend on our ability to expand into markets outside of the U.S. Expansion of our business depends on our ability to operate in these other regions.\nExpansion of our business outside of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Alaska may be adversely affected by:\n\u2022\nlocal regulations restricting foreign ownership of helicopter operators;\n\u2022\nrequirements to award contracts to local operators; and\n\u2022\nthe number and location of new drilling concessions granted by foreign governments.\nWe cannot predict the restrictions or requirements that may be imposed in the countries in which we operate or wish to operate. If we are unable to continue to operate or obtain and retain contracts in markets outside of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, our future business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our operations outside of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Alaska may not grow.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our international operations.\nWe operate and dry-lease helicopters in international markets. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 15% and 18%, respectively, of our operating revenues resulted from our international operations. We expect to increase our international operations in the future. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\npolitical conditions and events, including embargoes;\n\u2022\nrestrictive actions by U.S. and foreign governments, including those in Brazil, India, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom, that could limit our ability to provide services in those countries;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of withholding or other taxes on foreign income, tariffs or restrictions on foreign trade and investment;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nlimitations on repatriation of earnings or currency exchange controls and import/export quotas;\n\u2022\nnationalization, expropriation, asset seizure, blockades and blacklisting;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms, of insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nloss of contract rights and inability to adequately enforce contracts;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets, such as terrorist attacks, piracy and kidnapping;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange that affect demand for our services and our profitability;\n\u2022\npotential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the \u201cUKBA\u201d) and Brazil\u2019s Clean Companies Act (the \u201cBCCA\u201d);\n\u2022\nlabor strikes;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements, including those with respect to flight operations and environmental protections; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations.\nIf we are unable to adequately address these risks, we could lose our ability to operate in certain international markets and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn order to grow our business, we may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us.\nOur business is capital intensive, and to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we will need to raise additional funds through bank financings or other public or private debt or equity financings to execute our growth strategy. Adequate sources of capital funding may not be available when needed, or may not be available on favorable terms. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or certain types of convertible debt securities, dilution to the holdings of our existing stockholders may result. If we raise additional debt financing, we will incur additional interest expense and the terms of such debt may be at less favorable rates than existing debt and could require the pledge of assets as security or subject us to financial and/or operating covenants that affect our ability to conduct our business. Our ability to engage in any capital raising activities would be subject to the restrictions in our existing debt instruments as well as in the Tax Matters Agreement. Refer to Part III, Item 13 - \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions - Agreements between SEACOR and Era Group Relating to the Separation - Tax Matters Agreement\u201d for additional information. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, or we are unable to conduct capital raising activities as a result of restrictions in our existing debt instruments or in the Tax Matters Agreement, we may be unable to acquire additional helicopters, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDifficult economic and financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe financial results of our business are both directly and indirectly dependent upon economic conditions throughout the world, which in turn can be impacted by conditions in the global financial markets. These factors are outside our control and changes in circumstances are difficult to predict. Uncertainty about global economic conditions may lead businesses to postpone spending in response to tighter credit and reductions in income or asset values, which may lead many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. Weak economic activity may lead government customers to cut back on services. Factors such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation), trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls, and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts or security operations) could have a material adverse effect on our business and investments, which could reduce our revenues, profitability and value of our assets. These factors including the failure of lenders participating in our amended and restated senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) to fulfill their commitments and obligations may also adversely affect our liquidity and our financial condition, and the business, liquidity and financial condition of our customers. Adverse economic and liquidity conditions for our customers could negatively impact their capital investment activity and increase our ongoing exposure to credit risks on our accounts receivable balances. We have procedures that are designed to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables; however, there can be no assurance that such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses, and, if not effective, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, a slowdown in economic activity could reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in an extended period of lower oil and natural gas prices. A reduction in oil and natural gas prices could depress the activity levels of oil and gas companies, which in turn would reduce demand for our services. Perceptions of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and gas companies can similarly further reduce or defer major expenditures of oil and gas companies given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects. Lower levels of activity can result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. Unstable economic conditions or turmoil in financial markets may also increase the volatility of our stock price.\nWe are exposed to credit risks.\nWe are exposed to credit risk on trade receivables from the unexpected loss in cash and earnings when a customer cannot meet its obligation to us or when the value of security provided declines. Customer credit risk is further enhanced during times of depressed oil prices such as the one we are currently experiencing. To mitigate trade credit risk, we have developed credit policies that include the review, approval and monitoring of new customers, annual credit evaluations and credit limits. There can be no assurance that our risk mitigation strategies will be effective and that credit risk will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are exposed to credit risk on our financial investments and financial instruments that are dependent upon the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligations to us. We manage credit risk by entering into arrangements with established counterparties that possess investment grade credit ratings, monitoring our concentration risk with counterparties on an ongoing basis and through the establishment of credit policies and limits, which are applied in the selection of counterparties.\nWeather and seasonality can impact our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues is dependent on actual flight hours. Prolonged periods of adverse weather and storms can adversely impact our operations and flight hours. A significant portion of our operating revenue is dependent upon actual flight hours, and a substantial portion of our direct cost is fixed. The fall and winter months generally have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year, with poor visibility, high winds, and heavy precipitation in some areas. Although\nsome of our helicopters are equipped to fly at night, operations servicing offshore oil and gas transport of passengers, and also other non-emergency operations, are generally conducted during daylight hours. During winter months there are fewer daylight hours, particularly in Alaska. Flight hours, and therefore revenues, tend to decline in the winter. In addition, oil and gas exploration, development and production activity in Alaska decreases during the winter months due to the harsh weather conditions. Our operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may also be adversely affected by weather. Tropical storm season runs from June through November. Tropical storms and hurricanes limit our ability to operate our helicopters in the proximity of a storm, reduce oil and gas exploration, development and production activity, could result in the incurrence of additional expenses to secure equipment and facilities and may require us to evacuate our aircraft, personnel and equipment out of the path of a storm. In addition, a significant portion of our facilities are located along the coasts of these regions, so extreme weather may cause substantial damage to our property in these location. Despite our efforts to plan for storms and secure our equipment, we may suffer damage to our helicopters or our facilities, thereby reducing our ability to provide our services. Accordingly, our reduced ability to operate in harsh weather conditions and darkness may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, these factors also result in seasonal impacts on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to develop or implement new technologies could affect our results of operations.\nMany of the helicopters that we operate are characterized by changing technology, introductions and enhancements of models of helicopters and services and shifting customer demands, including technology preferences. Our future growth and financial performance will depend in part upon our ability to develop, market and integrate new services and to accommodate the latest technological advances and client preferences. In addition, the introduction of new technologies or services that compete with our services could result in our revenues decreasing over time. If we are unable to upgrade our operations or fleet with the latest technological advances in a timely manner, or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to, and may in the future be subject to, a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of their merits, legal proceedings may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. We may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have a material adverse effect on a portion of our business operations or a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations should we fail to prevail in such matters.\nWe may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.\nWe continuously evaluate the acquisition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions. Any such transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests. The consideration for such transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in us or our subsidiaries, or a contribution of equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets. Such dispositions could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests.\nThese transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant revenues and income streams, increased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain covenants in our debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations or the number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock, thereby diluting holders of our Common Stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.\nThere are risks associated with our debt structure.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our indebtedness consisted of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.750% senior notes due 2022 (the \u201c7.750% Senior Notes\u201d), $85.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $27.4 million of aggregate indebtedness of one of our subsidiaries outstanding under two promissory notes. In addition, we had the ability to borrow up to an additional $214.3 million under our Revolving Credit Facility, after taking into account the financial ratios we are required to maintain under the facility as discussed in more detail below.\nThe agreements governing our Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture governing our 7.750% Senior Notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens or pledge the assets of certain of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain sales of all or substantially all of our assets, mergers and consolidations.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility requires that we maintain a maximum ratio of funded debt to EBITDA, as defined, of 5.0 to 1.0, a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum ratio of the sum of (i) fair market value of mortgaged helicopters, as defined, (ii) accounts receivable and (iii) inventory to funded debt of 1.2 to 1.0. Failure to comply with these covenants is an event of default under the facility, and therefore, our ability to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility is dependent on and limited by our ability to comply with them. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIf we experience reduced operating revenues, our ability to utilize our Revolving Credit Facility may be limited and we may require additional investments in our capital stock to maintain our financial ratio within applicable limits. Any inability to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make capital expenditures, on our results of operations and on our liquidity. Further, failure to maintain the financial ratios required under the Revolving Credit Facility would constitute an event of default, allowing the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility to declare the entire balance of any and all sums payable under the Revolving Credit Facility immediately due and payable, which in turn would permit the holders of the 7.750% Senior Notes to accelerate maturity of the 7.750% Senior Notes as well.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and refinance our indebtedness, including any future debt that we may incur, will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales, which are subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, seasonality and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including (i) reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or (ii) dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in our industry could be impaired. The lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of our other debt.\nOur future debt levels and the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur may contain restrictive covenants and limit our liquidity and our ability to obtain additional financing and pursue acquisitions and joint ventures or purchase new helicopters. Tight credit conditions could limit our ability to secure additional financing, if required, due to difficulties accessing the credit and capital markets.\nOur global operations are subject to foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity and commodity price risks.\nWe are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks. A significant portion of our capital purchase obligations are denominated in foreign currencies and, although some of these risks may be hedged, fluctuations could significantly impact our cost of purchase and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operation. We purchase some of our helicopters and helicopter parts from foreign manufacturers and maintain operations in foreign countries, which results in portions of our revenues and expenses being denominated in foreign currencies. We attempt to minimize our exposure to currency exchange risk by contracting the majority of our services in U.S. dollars. As a result, a strong U.S. dollar may increase the local cost of our services that are provided under the U.S. dollar denominated contracts, which may reduce demand for our services in foreign countries. Some of these risks may be hedged, but fluctuations could impact our financial condition and our results of operations. Our financial condition and our results of operations may also be affected by the cost of hedging activities that we undertake to protect against currency exchange risk. We operate in countries with foreign exchange controls, including Brazil and India. These controls may limit our ability to repatriate funds from our unconsolidated foreign affiliates or otherwise convert local currencies into U.S. dollars. These limitations could adversely affect our ability to access cash from these operations and our liquidity.\nOur inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAttracting and retaining qualified pilots, mechanics and other highly skilled personnel is an important factor in our future success. Specifically, the Company is engaged in a search for a Chief Financial Officer to assume those responsibilities from Chris Bradshaw who is currently serving as both Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business and our growth strategy. Many of our customers require pilots with very high levels of flight experience. In addition, the maintenance of our helicopters requires mechanics that are trained and experienced in servicing particular makes and models of helicopters. The market for these highly skilled personnel is competitive and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in the future. In\naddition, if we enter into new markets, obtain additional customer contracts, experience an increase in the demand for our services, add new helicopter models to our fleet or experience a sudden change in demand for a specific model of aircraft, we may be required to hire additional pilots, mechanics and other flight-related personnel, which we may not be able to do on a timely or cost-effective basis. Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our current business and future growth.\nIf our employees were to unionize, our operating costs could increase.\nOur employees are not currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement. However, we have no assurances that our employees will not unionize in the future. Periodically, certain groups of our employees may consider entering into such an agreement. If any of our employees were to unionize, it could increase our operating costs, force us to alter our operating methods and/or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact us.\nMedia coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by us or relate to accidents or other issues involving the safety of our helicopters or operations, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation or governmental investigations by regulators. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on our reputation, our customer relationships and the morale of our employees, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows from operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology, and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted and our business could be negatively affected.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information; to capture knowledge of our business; to coordinate our business across our operation bases; and to communicate within our company and with customers, suppliers, partners and other third-parties. These information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns, hardware or software failures, power outages, computer viruses, cyber attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Our information technology systems are becoming increasingly integrated, so damage, disruption or shutdown to the system could result in a more widespread impact. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our operations could be disrupted and our business could be negatively affected. In addition, cyber attacks could lead to potential unauthorized access and disclosure of confidential information, and data loss and corruption. There is no assurance that we will not experience these service interruptions or cyber attacks in the future. Further, as the methods of cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber attacks.\nRisk Factors Relating to Regulations\nIf we do not restrict the amount of foreign ownership of our Common Stock, we may fail to remain a U.S. citizen, might lose our status as a U.S. air carrier and be prohibited from operating helicopters in the U.S., which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince we hold the status of a U.S. air carrier under the regulations of both the U.S. DOT and the FAA and we engage in the operating and dry-leasing of helicopters in the U.S., we are subject to regulations pursuant to the Transportation Code and other statutes (collectively, \u201cAviation Acts\u201d). The Transportation Code requires that Certificates to engage in air transportation be held only by citizens of the U.S. as that term is defined in the relevant section of the Transportation Code. That section requires: (i) that our president and two-thirds of our board of directors and other managing officers be U.S. citizens; (ii) that at least 75% of our outstanding voting stock be owned by U.S. citizens; and (iii) that we must be under the actual control of U.S. citizens. Further, our helicopters operating in the U.S. must generally be registered in the U.S. In order to register such helicopters under the Aviation Acts, we must be owned or controlled by U.S. citizens. Although our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions intended to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Aviation Acts, a failure to maintain compliance would result in loss of our air carrier status and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and we would be prohibited from both operating as an air carrier and operating helicopters in the U.S. during any period in which we did not comply with these regulations.\nThe Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore resources for the production of oil and gas.\nWe currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from services we provide in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in support of offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production activity. As such, we are subject to the U.S. government\u2019s exercise of authority under the provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act that restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases by requiring lease conditions such as the implementation of safety and environmental protections, the preparation of spill\ncontingency plans and air quality standards for certain pollutants, the violations of which could result in potential court injunctions curtailing operations and lease cancellations and by requiring that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf provide open and nondiscriminatory access to shippers. These provisions could adversely impact exploration and production activity in these regions. If activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in these regions declines, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation that limits foreign ownership of helicopter companies.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation that limits foreign ownership of helicopter companies. Failure to comply with regulations and requirements for citizen ownership in the various markets in which we operate and may operate in the future, may subject our helicopters to deregistration or impoundment. If required levels of citizen ownership are not met or maintained, joint ventures in which we have significant investments also could be prohibited from operating within these countries. Deregistration of our helicopters or helicopters operated by our joint venture partners for any reason, including foreign ownership in excess of permitted levels, would have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct operations within these markets. We cannot assure you that there will be no changes in aviation laws, regulations, required levels of citizen ownership, or administrative requirements or the interpretations thereof, that could restrict or prohibit our ability to operate in certain regions. Any such restriction or prohibition on our ability to operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to tax and other legal compliance risks, including anti-corruption statutes, the violation of which may adversely affect our business and operations.\nAs a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Changes in laws or regulations and related interpretations and other guidance could result in higher expenses and payments. Uncertainty relating to such laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights.\nIn order to compete effectively in certain foreign jurisdictions, we seek to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners. We are subject to a variety of tax and legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to taxes and compliance with U.S. and foreign export laws such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, competition laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the UKBA and the BCCA. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business. Each of the UKBA and BCCA has similar provisions. We could be charged with wrongdoing for any of these matters as a result of our actions or the actions of our agents, local partners or joint ventures, even though these parties may not be subject to such statutes. If convicted or found liable of tax or other legal infractions, or if we have been determined to be in violation of the FCPA, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also subject to laws in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. regulating competition.\nIndependently, failure by us or one of our joint ventures or strategic partners to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges.\nEnvironmental regulation and liabilities, including new or developing laws and regulations, may increase our costs of operations and adversely affect us.\nOur business is subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health, including laws that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters. Such laws include the federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, which imposes restrictions on the discharge of pollutants to the navigable waters of the U.S. We are also subject to the Coastal Zone Management Act, which authorizes state development and implementation of certain programs to manage water pollution to restore and protect coastal waters. In addition, because our operations generate and, in some cases, involve the transportation of hazardous wastes, we are subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which regulates the use, generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and certain non-hazardous wastes. Violations of these laws, along with comparable state and local laws, may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions or other sanctions. We are also subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and certain comparable state laws, which establish strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several liabilities for specified parties in connection with liability for the investigation and remediation of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and damages to natural resources. Such liability can arise even as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or third parties. In addition, our customers in the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry are affected by environmental laws and regulations, which have recently become stricter as a result of the Deepwater Horizon matter (discussed above), that restrict their activities and may result in reduced demand for our services.\nAny failure by us to comply with any environmental laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil or criminal sanctions, revocation or denial of permits or other authorizations, imposition of limitations on our operations, and site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations change frequently, which makes it difficult to predict their cost or impact on our results of operations. In recent years, governments have increasingly focused on climate change, carbon emissions, and energy use. Laws and regulations that curb the use of energy, or require the use of renewable fuels or renewable sources of energy-such as wind or solar power-could result in a reduction in demand for hydrocarbon-based fuels such as oil and natural gas. In addition, governments could pass laws, regulations or taxes that increase the cost of fuel, thereby impacting both demand for our services and also our cost of operations. Such initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActions taken by government agencies, such as the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration, could increase our costs and prohibit or reduce our ability to operate successfully.\nOur operations are highly regulated by several U.S. government regulatory agencies. For example, as a certified air carrier, we are subject to regulations promulgated by the DOT and the FAA. The FAA regulates our flight operations and imposes requirements with respect to personnel, aircraft, ground facilities and other aspects of our operations, including:\n\u2022\ncertification and reporting requirements;\n\u2022\ninspections;\n\u2022\nmaintenance standards;\n\u2022\npersonnel training standards; and\n\u2022\nmaintenance of personnel and aircraft records.\nThe Department of Transportation can review our economic fitness to continue our operations, both presently and if a substantial change occurs to our management, ownership or capital structure, among other things. The Department of Commerce, through its International Traffic in Arms Regulations, regulates our imports and exports of aircraft (through leases and sales) as well as parts sales to international customers and the use of certain regulated technology in domestic and international airspace. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, or if these agencies develop concerns over our operations, we could face administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties. In addition, we may become subject to regulatory actions that could suspend, curtail or significantly modify our operations. A suspension or substantial curtailment of our operations or any substantial modification of our current operations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture changes to the regulations and laws under which we operate, and promulgation of new regulations and laws also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur FBO in Alaska is subject to extensive government regulation and other cost-related risks that could disrupt operations.\nOur FBO in Alaska is subject to oversight by the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, is dependent upon that airport being \u201copen for business\u201d and is subject to federal regulatory requirements by the FAA, the Transportation Security Administration (the \u201cTSA\u201d) and other agencies. If the FAA, TSA or other agencies were to impose significant operating restrictions or increase insurance obligations such that insurance could not be obtained or purchased for a reasonable cost, or if any federal regulatory requirement were to require significant expenditure, the market for services from our FBO could be significantly impaired or entirely eliminated. In addition, the biggest revenue producing activity at our FBO, fuel sales to transient customers, could be adversely impacted by increases in fuel prices, the ability of our competitors to undercut our pricing, restrictions on private air travel and/or taxes on fuel or aircraft, any of which could make private air travel prohibitively expensive. Should the FBO\u2019s operations be restricted or shut down, whether due to regulatory issues, the weather, a natural disaster, terrorist activity, or any other reason, our operations could be adversely impacted.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock may be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the broader stock market;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new equipment or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nsales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nregulatory or political developments;\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u2022\nchanging economic conditions.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nIf securities analysts or industry analysts downgrade our ordinary shares, publish negative research or reports or fail to publish reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business and our market. If one or more analysts adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock or our competitors\u2019 stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe limit foreign ownership of our company, which could reduce the price of our Common Stock and cause owners of our Common Stock who are not U.S. persons to lose their voting rights.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that persons or entities that are not \u201ccitizens of the U.S.\u201d (as defined in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958) shall not collectively own or control more than 24.9% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock (the \u201cPermitted Foreign Ownership Percentage\u201d) and that, if at any time persons that are not citizens of the U.S. nevertheless collectively own or control more than the Permitted Foreign Ownership Percentage, the voting rights of our outstanding voting capital stock in excess of the Permitted Foreign Ownership Percentage owned by stockholders who are not citizens of the U.S. shall automatically be reduced. These voting rights will be reduced pro rata among the holders of voting shares who are not citizens of the U.S. to equal the Permitted Foreign Ownership Percentage based on the number of votes to which the underlying voting securities are entitled. Shares held by persons who are not citizens of the U.S. may lose their associated voting rights and be redeemed as a result of these provisions. These restrictions may also have a material adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of our Common Stock because holders may be unable to transfer our Common Stock to persons who are not citizens of the U.S.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Operation as a Public Company\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will be exempt from certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nIn April 2012, President Obama signed into law the JOBS Act, which contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for emerging growth companies, including certain requirements relating to accounting standards and compensation disclosure. We are classified as an emerging growth company, which is defined as a company with annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion, that has been a public reporting company for a period of less than five years, and that does not have a public float of $700 million or more in securities held by non-affiliated holders. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, unlike other public companies, unless we elect not to take advantage of applicable JOBS Act provisions, we will not be required to (i) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards are also applicable to private companies under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act, (iii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), such as the proposed requirements for mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, (iv) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 unless the SEC determines otherwise, (v) provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or (vi) hold stockholder advisory and other votes on executive compensation. We cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAs noted above, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies.\nWe have elected not to take advantage of such extended transition period. This election is irrevocable pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act.\nThe cost of compliance or failure to comply with the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the NYSE requirements may adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cthe Exchange Act\u201d) and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, we are now subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including the requirements of the NYSE. These requirements impose significant compliance obligations upon us and may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. The failure to comply with Section 404 may result in investors losing confidence in the reliability of our financial statements (which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our Common Stock), prevent us from providing the required financial information in a timely manner (which could materially and adversely impact our business, our financial condition, the trading price of our Common Stock and our ability to access capital markets, if necessary), prevent us from otherwise complying with the standards applicable to us as an independent, publicly-traded company and subject us to adverse regulatory consequences.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.\nMaintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud. As noted in Part II Item 9A - \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,\u201d management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2014. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed. We are currently evaluating and implementing a process to document and test our internal control procedures to satisfy Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley and the related rules of the SEC requiring our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting to the extent we are no longer an emerging growth company. During the course of this documentation and testing, we may identify deficiencies that we may be unable to remedy before the requisite deadline for those reports. Our auditors have not conducted an audit of our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to remediate material weaknesses noted by us or our independent registered public accounting firm or to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. If our management or our independent registered public accounting firm were to conclude in their reports that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our Common Stock could drop significantly. Failure to comply with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the NYSE, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or other regulatory authorities.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include certain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in our management, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of our stockholders to fill a vacancy on the board of directors;\n\u2022\nrestrictions related to the ability of non-U.S. citizens owning our Common Stock;\n\u2022\nour ability to issue preferred stock with terms that the board of directors may determine, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors which may limit the ability of minority stockholders to elect directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from soliciting proxies to elect a particular slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nThese provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company that is in the best interest of our stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Common Stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Spin-off\nOur historical financial information may not be representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone public company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nOur historical financial information may not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been an independent entity during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future. The costs and expenses reflected in our historical financial information include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by SEACOR, that may be different from the comparable expenses that we would have incurred had we operated as a stand-alone company. Our historical financial information does not reflect changes that will occur in our cost structure, financing and operations as a result of our transition to becoming a stand-alone public company, including changes in our cash management, employee base, potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with SEC reporting and NYSE requirements.\nIf there is a determination that the separation is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) ruling or tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then SEACOR, its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and Era Group could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, SEACOR received a private letter ruling from the IRS, together with an opinion of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, tax counsel to SEACOR, substantially to the effect that, among other things, the separation qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 of the Code. The ruling and opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from SEACOR and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, SEACOR and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of SEACOR or us after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable, SEACOR, its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and Era Group could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities\nPrior to the separation, we and SEACOR entered into the Tax Matters Agreement that governs the parties' respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and assistance and cooperation in respect of tax matters. Taxes relating to or arising out of the failure of certain of the transactions described in the private letter ruling request and the opinion of tax counsel to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be borne by SEACOR, except, in general, if such failure is attributable to our action or inaction or SEACOR's action or inaction, as the case may be, or any event (or series of events) involving our assets or stock or the assets or stock of SEACOR, as the case may be, in which case the resulting liability will be borne in full by us or SEACOR, respectively.\nOur obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. Further, even if we are not responsible for tax liabilities of SEACOR and its subsidiaries under the Tax Matters Agreement, we nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if SEACOR were to fail to pay them. If we are required to pay any liabilities under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement or pursuant to applicable tax law, the amounts may be significant.\nWe may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions for a period of time after the separation.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to SEACOR of the separation, under the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with SEACOR, we may not take any action that would jeopardize the favorable tax treatment of the distribution. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions that might increase the value of our business for the two-year period following the separation. Refer to Part III, Item 13. - \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions - Agreements between SEACOR and Era Group Relating to the Separation - Tax Matters Agreement\u201d for additional information.\nA number of our directors own common stock and other equity instruments of SEACOR, which could cause conflicts of interests.\nOur Non-Executive Chairman and a number of our other directors own a substantial amount of SEACOR common stock along with other equity instruments, the value of which is related to the value of common stock of SEACOR. The direct and indirect interests of our Non-Executive Chairman and other directors in common stock of SEACOR and the presence of certain of SEACOR\u2019s principal executives on our board of directors could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving both us and SEACOR that could have different implications for SEACOR than they do for us. As a result, we may be precluded from pursuing certain opportunities on which we would otherwise act, such as acquisitions or other opportunities for expansion that would otherwise fit within our business model or would complement our growth strategy.\nThe Spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.\nThe distribution was subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent conveyance laws generally provide that an entity engages in a constructive fraudulent conveyance when (i) the entity transfers assets and does not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in return, and (ii) the entity (a) is insolvent at the time of the transfer or is rendered insolvent by the transfer, (b) has unreasonably small capital with which to carry on its business, or (c) intends to incur or believes it will incur debts beyond its ability to repay its debts as they mature. An unpaid creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a creditor (including without limitation a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or SEACOR or any of our respective subsidiaries) may bring an action alleging that the distribution or any of the related transactions constituted a constructive fraudulent conveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies, including without limitation, voiding our claims against SEACOR, requiring our stockholders to return to SEACOR some or all of the shares of our Common Stock issued in the distribution, or providing SEACOR with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by SEACOR and the fair market value of our company at the time of the distribution.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if (1) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities); (2) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than its probable liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured; (3) it cannot pay its debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) as they mature; or (4) it has unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged. We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, SEACOR or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the distribution.\nThe distribution of our Common Stock is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (i) out of its surplus (net assets minus capital) or (ii) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Although SEACOR intended that the distribution of our Common Stock be entirely from surplus, we cannot assure you that a court will not later determine that some or all of the distribution to SEACOR stockholders was unlawful.\nAs a condition to the distribution, the SEACOR board of directors obtained an opinion from a nationally recognized provider of such opinions that SEACOR and Era Group were each solvent and adequately capitalized immediately after the separation. We cannot assure you, however, that a court would reach the same conclusions set forth in such opinion in determining whether SEACOR or we were insolvent at the time of, or after giving effect to, the Spin-off, or whether lawful funds were available for the separation and the distribution to SEACOR\u2019s stockholders.", "PERMNO": 59089, "SIC": 4522, "TIC": "VTOL"}
