{"cik": "1526796", "company": "Ignite Restaurant Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are currently seeking to sell the Company, but may not be successful in effecting a sale transaction.\nOn April 3, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors, working together with our management team and financial advisors, has commenced a process to pursue the sale of our business, which could be sold as an entirety or through the separate sales of our two restaurant brands, Joe\u2019s and Brick House. There can be no assurance that the process that we are undertaking will be successful. In addition, we cannot predict the terms or timing of any transaction that may be undertaken or whether any such transaction will result in any proceeds for the holders of our common stock.\nWe are currently pursuing certain strategic alternatives in an effort to improve our capital structure, but these efforts may not be successful.\nWe are currently in discussions with our lenders in an effort to pursue various strategic alternatives. We can give no assurance that we will successfully execute any strategic alternatives we are currently pursuing or any others, and our ability to do so could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the economic or business environment, financial market volatility, the performance of our business, and the terms and conditions of the 2014 Credit Facility.\nWe may be required to file for protection in bankruptcy, even if we are successful in effecting a sale of our business or improving our capital structure. Any bankruptcy proceeding may result in the holders of our common stock receiving no proceeds.\nIt is possible that even a successful implementation of one of the strategic alternatives that we are pursuing will require us to make a filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Our seeking relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, whether or not such relief leads to a quick emergence from Chapter 11, could materially adversely affect the relationships between us and our existing and potential customers, employees, suppliers, and others, and could result in little or no recovery to our existing security holders.\nYou should not rely on historical results in our restaurant sales or our average unit volumes as an indication of our future results of operations because they may fluctuate significantly.\nA number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our restaurant sales and average unit volumes, including, among other factors:\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business strategy effectively;\n\u2022\nunusually strong initial sales performance by new restaurants;\n\u2022\ncompetition;\n\u2022\nconsumer trends and confidence;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new menu items; and\n\u2022\nregional and national macroeconomic conditions.\nOur restaurant sales and average unit volumes may not increase at rates achieved in prior fiscal years or may decrease below levels achieved in recent years. Changes in our restaurant sales and average unit volumes could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nMacroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain the sales and profits of existing restaurants or to open new restaurants.\nAlthough the global economy has shown signs of recovery over the last several years, the United States may continue to suffer from depressed economic activity. Recessionary economic cycles, higher fuel and other energy costs, lower housing values, low consumer confidence, inflation, increases in commodity prices, higher interest rates, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws or other economic factors that may affect discretionary consumer spending could adversely affect our revenues and profit margins and make opening new restaurants more difficult. Our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out. This could result in reduced guest traffic, reduced average checks or limitations on the prices we can charge for our menu items, any of which could reduce our sales and profit margins. In addition, many of our Joe\u2019s restaurants are located in areas that we consider tourist or vacation destinations. Therefore, in those locations, we depend in large part on vacation travelers to frequent our Joe\u2019s restaurants, and such destinations typically experience a reduction in visitors during economic downturns, thereby reducing the potential guests that could visit our restaurants. Also, businesses in the shopping vicinity in which some of our restaurants are located may experience difficulty as a result of macroeconomic trends or cease to operate, which could, in turn, further negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth strategy.\nIf we fail to execute our growth strategy, which partially depends on our ability to open new restaurants that are profitable, our business could suffer.\nHistorically, one of the key means of achieving our growth strategies has been through opening new restaurants and operating those restaurants on a profitable basis. We expect this to continue to be an important element of our growth in the future. For fiscal year 2017, we do not plan to open any new restaurants but are targeting opening new restaurants in the future. Competition for prime locations is intense and the prices commanded for such locations have remained high. There is no guarantee that a sufficient number of locations will be available in desirable areas or on terms that are acceptable to us in order to achieve our growth plan. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants, or achieving lower than expected sales in new restaurants, could materially adversely affect our growth strategy. Once we have identified suitable restaurant sites, our ability to open new restaurants successfully and on the development schedule we anticipate will also depend on numerous other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other items, the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to secure suitable new restaurant sites;\n\u2022\nour ability to control the timing and costs of construction and development of new restaurants;\n\u2022\nour ability to negotiate suitable lease terms;\n\u2022\nour ability to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner and any changes in local, state or federal laws and regulations that adversely affect our costs or ability to open new restaurants;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of capital to fund construction costs and pre-opening expenses;\n\u2022\nconsumer acceptance of our new restaurants; and\n\u2022\nlimitations under our current and future credit facilities.\nAlthough we target specified new restaurant average unit volumes, cash on cash returns and capital investment for our brands, new restaurants may not meet these targets. Any restaurant we open may not be profitable or achieve operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants. We may not be able to respond on a timely basis to all of the changing demands that our planned expansion will impose on management and on our existing infrastructure, or be able to hire or retain the necessary management and operating personnel. Our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may not be adequate to support our planned expansion. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to locate, hire, train and retain management and operating personnel.\nThere is also the potential that some of our new restaurants will be located near areas where we have existing restaurants, thereby reducing the revenues of such existing restaurants.\nOur success depends on our ability to compete with many other restaurants.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with many well-established restaurant companies on the basis of food taste, price of products offered, guest service, atmosphere, location and overall guest experience. Our competitors include restaurant chains and individual restaurants that range from independent local operators to well-capitalized national and regional restaurant companies. Our Joe\u2019s restaurants compete against other casual seafood restaurants, including national and regional chains and local seafood restaurants, as well as against casual dining restaurants that provide a different type of food. Our Brick House restaurants compete against casual restaurants in the bar and grill segment and restaurants in the casual dining segment.\nSome of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in the restaurant industry better than we can. Other competitors are local restaurants that in some cases have a loyal guest base and strong brand recognition within a particular geographic market. As our competitors expand their operations or as new competitors enter the industry, we expect competition to intensify. Should our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, we could experience a loss of guest traffic to our competitors. Also, if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We also compete with other restaurant chains and other retail businesses for quality site locations, management and hourly employees.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may have material misstatements in our financial statements and we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely manner.\nAs a public company, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the date we are no longer a smaller reporting company or an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, if we continue to take advantage of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act. We expect that we will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year in which we have annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d which will occur at such time as we have (1) an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (2) been required to file annual, quarterly and current reports under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, for a period of at least 12 calendar months, and (3) filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act. As a result, we may qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until as late as May 10, 2017. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nThere is no guarantee that internal control deficiencies will not be identified in the future. Any future failure in our controls could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in a misstatement of our accounts and disclosures that could result in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements in future periods that would not be prevented or detected. If our financial statements are not timely or accurate, then, in addition to the risks described above, investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our ability to prevent fraud, and we could lose our ability to access capital markets.\nChanges in food and supply costs, including the cost of crab, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. Operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities, including crab, shrimp, lobster and other seafood. In fiscal year 2016, crab, lobster and shrimp accounted for approximately 49% of our total food purchases. Any increase in food prices, particularly for these food items, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such as weather conditions (including hurricanes), oil spills, fisherman strikes, food safety concerns, costs of distribution, product recalls and government regulations. Furthermore, the introduction of or changes to tariffs on seafood, such as imported crab and shrimp or other food products, could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu items and prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, because our menu items are moderately priced, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our guests. If we adjust pricing there is no assurance that we will realize the full benefit of any adjustment due to changes in our guests\u2019 menu item selections and guest traffic.\nBrick House is a newer and still evolving brand and our plans to expand Brick House may not be successful.\nWhile Joe\u2019s and Brick House are subject to the risks and uncertainties described herein, there is an enhanced level of risk and uncertainty related to the expansion of Brick House, our most recently developed brand. While Brick House, since its founding in 2008, has grown to 25 locations as of January 2, 2017, it is still evolving and has not yet proven its long-term growth potential.\nInitially, we opened Brick House restaurants across a broad range of geographies with the intent of optimizing the brand prior to a continued build out. While we continue to incorporate key insights into our new restaurant rollout plans, we believe the brand is now positioned for expansion. However, there can be no assurance that the enhancements we intend to implement as part of the brand optimization process will be successful or that additional new restaurant growth will occur. Brick House will be subject to the risks and uncertainties that accompany any emerging restaurant brand. If Brick House fails to expand and/or continue generating profits, our operating results could suffer.\nWe may incur costs resulting from breaches of security of confidential guest information related to our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions.\nThe majority of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. Recently, a number of other retailers, including other restaurant chains, have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information has been stolen. Although we use secure private networks to transmit confidential information, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the guest information transmitted in connection with credit and debit card sales, and our\nsecurity measures and those of technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. We may, in the future, become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these types of incidents. Any such claim or proceeding could cause us to incur significant unplanned expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations could significantly harm our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on us and our restaurants.\nFood safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.\nFood safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our guests enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food-borne illnesses, such as salmonella, E. coli, hepatitis A, trichinosis or \u201cmad cow disease,\u201d and food safety issues have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. In addition, publicity regarding certain illnesses and contaminations related to seafood, including high levels of mercury or other carcinogens, oil contaminations, vibrio vulnificus and the Norwalk virus could affect consumer preferences and the consumption of seafood. Any report or publicity linking us to instances of food-borne illness or other food safety issues, including food tampering or contamination, could adversely affect our brands and reputation as well as our revenues and profits. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry or seafood restaurants generally and adversely impact our sales.\nIn addition, our reliance on third-party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple locations would be affected rather than a single restaurant. Although we inspect food products when they are delivered to us, we cannot assure that all food items are properly maintained during transport throughout the supply chain and that our employees will identify all products that may be spoiled and should not be used in our restaurants. New illnesses resistant to any precautions may develop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise, such as \u201cmad cow disease,\u201d which could give rise to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. In addition, our industry has long been subject to the threat of food tampering by suppliers, employees or guests, such as the addition of foreign objects in the food that we sell. Reports, whether or not true, of injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations and brands of restaurant chains in the quick service restaurant segment and could affect us in the future as well. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination, whether or not at our restaurants, could subject us or our suppliers to a food recall pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Food Safety Modernization Act.\nChanges in consumer preferences could harm our performance.\nConsumer preferences often change rapidly and without warning, moving from one trend to another among many products or retail concepts. We also depend on trends regarding away-from-home dining. Consumer preferences towards away-from-home dining or certain food products might shift as a result of, among other things, health concerns or dietary trends related to cholesterol, carbohydrate, fat and salt content of certain food items, including crab or other seafood items, in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy. Changes in consumer preference away from the current menu offerings of our restaurant brands would have a material adverse effect on our business. Negative publicity over the health aspects of such food items may adversely affect demand for our menu items and could result in lower guest traffic, sales and results of operations.\nIf we fail to continue to develop and maintain our restaurant brands, our business could suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining and developing our restaurant brands are critical to our success and our growth strategy, and that the importance of brand recognition is significant as a result of competitors offering products similar to our products. We have made significant marketing expenditures to create and maintain brand loyalty as well as to increase awareness of our brands. If our brand-building strategy is unsuccessful, these expenses may never be recovered, and we may be unable to increase our future sales or implement our business strategy.\nAny incident that erodes consumer affinity for our brands could significantly reduce their respective values and damage our business. If guests perceive or experience a reduction in food quality, service or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer and our business may be adversely affected.\nThe impact of new restaurant openings could result in fluctuations in our financial performance.\nNew restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize. When our new restaurants open, they typically encounter startup costs, but also significant guest traffic and, therefore, high sales in their initial months. However, over time, these new restaurants may experience a decrease in guest traffic and sales compared to their opening months. Accordingly, sales achieved by new or converted restaurants may not be indicative of future operating results. Also, due to the foregoing factors, results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year.\nWe rely heavily on certain vendors, suppliers and distributors, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to maintain consistent price and quality throughout our restaurants depends in part upon our ability to acquire specified food products and supplies in sufficient quantities, especially with respect to shellfish such as crab. While our seafood offerings are generally caught from government regulated fisheries, crab and other fish are caught in the wild, which could cause volatility in supply. In some cases, we may have only one supplier or a limited number of suppliers for a particular food product. We cannot make assurances regarding the continued supply of our food items since we do not have control over the businesses of our suppliers. Furthermore, such food items are perishable, and we cannot assure that such items will be delivered by such third parties in appropriate condition for sale in our restaurants. In addition, we rely on one primary distributor to deliver products to our restaurants. If any of these vendors, our other suppliers or our distributor is unable to fulfill their obligations, or if we are unable to find replacement providers in the event of a supply or service disruption, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, which would materially harm our business.\nIn addition, we use various third-party vendors to provide, support and maintain most of our management information systems. We also outsource certain payroll functions to business process service providers. Such third-party vendors may not be able to handle the volume of activity or perform the quality of service necessary for our operations. The failure of such vendors to fulfill their support and maintenance obligations or service obligations could disrupt our operations. Furthermore, the outsourcing of certain of our business processes could negatively impact our internal control processes.\nInformation technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including point-of-sale processing at our restaurants. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems. Any damage or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and subject us to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities. While we utilize our personnel, as well as a variety of hardware and software, to monitor our systems, controls, firewalls and encryption and intend to maintain and upgrade our security technology and operational procedures to prevent damage, breaches or other disruptive problems, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful.\nApproximately 42% of our restaurants are located in Texas, California and Florida and, as a result, we are sensitive to economic and other trends and developments in those states.\nAs of January 2, 2017, 58 of our 137 restaurants were spread across Texas (34), California (11) and Florida (13). As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in those states, including their labor markets. In addition, given our geographic concentration in these states, negative publicity regarding any of our restaurants in such states could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, as could other occurrences in these regions such as local competitive changes, changes in consumer preferences, local strikes, new or revised laws or regulations, energy shortages or changes in energy prices, droughts, hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, floods or other natural disasters.\nIn addition, many of our restaurants in California and Florida are located in areas that we consider tourist or vacation destinations. Therefore, we depend in large part on vacation travelers to frequent our restaurants in these locations. Any change in consumer preferences away from California and Florida as their choice of destination could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nAllergy concerns relating to crab and other shellfish items could affect consumer preferences and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nMany of our food items contain crab or other shellfish items. In recent years, there has been negative publicity concerning shellfish and other food allergies. This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning food products we serve, may adversely impact demand for our food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants. Owing to the severe nature of certain shellfish allergies, shellfish have recently been identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a significant allergen. The introduction of seafood and shellfish labeling regulations to the restaurant industry could cause us to modify the operations or atmosphere of our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business and brand differentiation.\nHealth concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as H1N1, Ebola, avian influenza, SARS and various other forms of influenza. To the extent that a virus is transmitted by human-to-human contact, our employees or guests could become infected, or could choose to, or be advised to avoid gathering in public places and avoid eating in restaurant establishments, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend upon our executive officers and may not be able to retain or replace these individuals or recruit additional personnel, which could harm our business.\nWe have recently announced changes in our senior management, with Robert S. Merritt resigning as our Chief Executive Officer following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Jonathan Tibus being elected to that position, and Brad A. Leist, currently our Chief Financial Officer, being elected as our Chief Administrative Officer. There can be no assurance that the newly appointed officers will be effective in these roles. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace such personnel on a timely basis. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which could cause our common stock price to decline. As our business expands, our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified executive-level personnel. Our inability to attract and retain qualified executive officers in the future could impair our growth and harm our business.\nWe are dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees while also controlling labor costs.\nWe are dependent upon the availability of qualified restaurant personnel. Our future performance will depend on our ability to attract, motivate and retain our Regional Vice Presidents, Directors of Operations and restaurant-level managers. Competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of members of our restaurant management team or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could materially harm our business.\nIn addition, availability of staff varies widely from restaurant to restaurant. If we experience high levels of restaurant management and staff turnover, we could suffer higher direct costs associated with recruiting, training and retaining replacement personnel. Moreover, we could suffer from significant indirect costs, including restaurant disruptions due to management changeover and potential delays in new restaurant openings or adverse guest reactions to inadequate guest service levels due to staff shortages. Competition for qualified employees may exert upward pressure on wages paid to attract such personnel, resulting in higher labor costs, together with greater recruitment and training expense.\nWe must comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act and various federal and state laws governing employment matters, such as minimum wage, tip credit allowance, overtime pay practices, child labor laws and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. Federal, state and municipal laws may also require us to provide new or increased levels of employee benefits to our employees, many of whom are not currently eligible for such benefits. Many of our employees are hourly workers whose wages are likely to be affected by an increase in the federal or state minimum wage or changes to the tip credit allowance. Proposals have been made, and continue to be made, at federal and state levels to increase minimum wage levels, including changes to the tip credit allowance. An increase in the minimum wage or a change in the tip credit allowance may require an increase or create pressure to increase the pay scale for our employees. In addition, while we take certain measures to operate our restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration regulations and the requirements of certain states, some of our employees, especially given the location of many of our restaurants, may fail to meet federal work authorization or residency requirements, which could result in disruptions in our work force, sanctions against us and adverse publicity. A shortage in the labor pool or other general inflationary pressures or changes could also increase our labor costs. A shortage in the labor pool could also cause our restaurants to be required to operate with reduced staff, which could negatively impact our ability to provide adequate service levels to our guests.\nAmong the federal laws with which we must comply is the National Labor Relations Act that applies to the election by employees to be represented by a labor organization for purposes of collective bargaining over wages, hours, working conditions and terms and conditions of employment. Currently, none of our employees are represented by labor organizations for these purposes. However, potential union representation and collective bargaining agreements may result in increased labor costs that can have an impact on competitiveness. Labor disputes, as well, may precipitate strikes and picketing that may have an impact on business, including guest patronage and supplier deliveries.\nOur existing senior secured credit facility contains financial covenants, negative covenants and other restrictions and failure to comply with these requirements could cause the related indebtedness to become due and payable and limit our ability to incur additional debt.\nThe lenders\u2019 obligation to extend credit under our existing senior secured credit facility depends upon our maintaining certain financial covenants. In particular, our senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, plus certain additional addbacks more particularly specified in the credit agreement), an interest coverage ratio, and capital expenditure limits. The leverage and interest coverage ratios are computed at the end of each fiscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period. The facility provides that (a) the leverage ratio shall not exceed (i) 5.75x through December 29, 2014, (ii) 5.5x from December 30, 2014 through June 29, 2015, (iii) 5.25x from June 30, 2015 through December 28, 2015, (iv) 5.0x from December 29, 2015 through March 28, 2016, (v) 4.75x from March 29, 2016 through June 27, 2016, (vi) 4.25x on June 28, 2016 through September 26, 2016, (vii) 4.0x on September 27, 2016 through April 3, 2017, (viii) 3.75x from April 4, 2017 through October 2, 2017, (ix) 3.5x from October 3, 2017 through April 2, 2018, (x) 3.25x from April 3, 2018 through December 31, 2018, and (xi) 3.0x from January 1, 2019 through maturity date; and (b) an interest coverage ratio of at least (i) 2.0x through June 29, 2015, (ii) 2.25x from June 30, 2015 through March 28, 2016, (iii) 2.5x from March 29, 2016 through June 27, 2016, (iv) 2.75x from June 28, 2016 through January 2, 2017, (v) 3.0x from January 3, 2017 through July 3, 2017, (vi) 3.25x from July 4, 2017 through April 2, 2018, (vii) 3.5x from April 3, 2018 through December 31, 2018, and (viii) 3.75x from January 1, 2019 through maturity date. Failure to adhere to these ratios could result in an acceleration of outstanding amounts under the credit facility and restrict us from borrowing amounts under the facility to fund our future liquidity requirements. In addition, our credit facility contains certain negative covenants, which, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments, guarantees or loans;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or otherwise dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nenter into sale-leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our or our lenders\u2019 affiliates.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments and comply with financial covenants will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to other financial, business and other factors beyond our control described herein. Please see \u201cGoing Concern\u201d disclosures in Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7. Our obligations and the guarantees under the senior secured credit facility are secured by substantially all of our and such subsidiaries\u2019 present and future assets and a perfected first priority lien on the capital stock or other equity interests of our direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nWe have entered into a forbearance agreement with certain of the lenders and the Administrative Agent under the 2014 Credit Facility under which they have agreed to forbear from taking any action to enforce their rights and remedies in connection with certain defaults, events of default, and anticipated events of default. Should we be in default of the forbearance agreement or should the required lenders and the Administrative Agent not agree to further extend such forbearance agreement, the Administrative Agent and lenders would be free to exercise any rights and remedies with respect to such defaults and events of default pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Credit Facility.\nOn March 31, 2017, we entered the Forbearance Agreement. The Forbearance Agreement is effective until the earliest of (i) May 9, 2017, or (ii) the occurrence or existence of any default or event of default other than defaults, events of default and anticipated events of default that are subject to the Forbearance Agreement. Should we be in default of the Forbearance Agreement or should the required lenders and the Administrative Agent not agree to further extend such Forbearance Agreement, the Administrative Agent and lenders would be free to exercise any rights and remedies with respect to such defaults and events of defaults pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Credit Facility which could include accelerating the maturity of all our indebtedness. If our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we will not have sufficient liquidity to repay the entire balance of our outstanding borrowings.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms.\nThe development of our business may require significant additional capital in the future to fund our operations and growth, among other activities. We have historically relied upon cash generated by our operations and our senior secured credit facility to fund our operations. In the future, we intend to rely on funds from operations and, if necessary, our senior secured credit facility. We may also need to access the debt and equity capital markets. There can be no assurance, however, that these sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreements governing our then-outstanding debt. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financings unattractive to us. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital, our operations could be impacted.\nAs of January 2, 2017, we had approximately $121.3 million of total indebtedness outstanding and available borrowing capacity of $13.9 million under our credit agreement. We may not be able to refinance our indebtedness prior to or at its maturity on acceptable terms or at all.\nLegal complaints or litigation may impact our business.\nOccasionally, restaurant guests and/or employees file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants, or that we have problems with food quality or operations. We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. We have been subject to class action lawsuits related to these matters and could be subject to additional class action lawsuits in the future. In recent years, a number of restaurant companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace conditions, employment and similar matters. A number of these industry lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by defendants. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their guests.\nRegardless, however, of whether any claim brought against us in the future is valid or whether we are liable, such a claim would be expensive to defend and may divert time, money and other valuable resources away from our operations and, thereby, hurt our business.\nWe are subject to certain state and local \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes, which may subject us to uninsured liabilities. These statutes generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to seek to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. In the past, after allegedly consuming alcoholic beverages at our restaurants, there have been isolated instances where certain individuals have been killed or injured or have killed or injured third parties. Because these statutes may allow a plaintiff to seek punitive damages, which may not be fully covered by insurance, this type of action could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. A judgment in such an action significantly in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, adverse publicity resulting from any such allegations may adversely affect us, our restaurant brands, and our restaurants taken as a whole.\nFailure to obtain and maintain required licenses and permits or to comply with alcoholic beverage or food control regulations could lead to the loss of our liquor and food service licenses and, thereby, harm our business.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to various federal, state and local government regulations, including those relating to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages. Such regulations are subject to change from time to time. The failure to obtain and maintain these licenses, permits and approvals could adversely affect our operating results. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked, suspended or denied renewal for cause at any time if governmental authorities determine that our conduct violates applicable regulations. Difficulties or failure to maintain or obtain the required licenses and approvals could adversely affect our existing restaurants and delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants, which would adversely affect our business.\nIn fiscal year 2016, approximately 13% of Joe\u2019s gross revenues and 40% of Brick House gross revenues were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages. Our alcoholic beverage sales may increase in the future. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on-premises and to provide service for extended hours and on Sundays. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our restaurants, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, other relationships with alcohol manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. In the past, we have been subject to fines for violations of alcoholic beverage control regulations. Any future failure to comply with these regulations and obtain or retain liquor licenses could adversely affect our results of operations and overall financial condition.\nWe are subject to many federal, state and local laws with which compliance is both costly and complex.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the recently enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation and those relating to building and zoning requirements and the preparation and sale of food. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and liquor licenses, federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees (including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and applicable requirements concerning the minimum wage, overtime, family leave, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards, immigration status, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates and state and local payroll taxes), federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (the \u201cADA\u201d).\nMinimum employee health care coverage mandated by state or federal legislation, such as the federal healthcare reform legislation that became law in March 2010 (known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the PPACA), could significantly increase our employee health benefit costs or require us to alter the benefits we provide to our employees. To date, we have not experienced material costs related to such legislation. However, due to the phased-in nature of the implementation and the lack of interpretive guidance, it is difficult to determine at this time what impact the health care reform legislation will have on our financial results. Possible adverse effects could include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees. Providing more extensive health insurance benefits to employees than the health insurance benefits we currently provide and to a potentially larger proportion of our employees, or the payment of penalties if the specified level of coverage is not provided at an affordable cost to employees, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, these laws require employers to comply with a significant number of new reporting and notice requirements from the Departments of Treasury, Labor and Health and Human Services, and we will have to develop systems and processes to track the requisite information and to comply with the reporting and notice requirements. Our suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. In addition, certain laws, including the ADA, could require us to expend significant funds to make modifications to our restaurants if we failed to comply with applicable standards. Compliance with all of these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nNew information or attitudes regarding diet and health could result in additional menu labeling laws and changes in regulations and consumer eating habits that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRegulations and consumer eating habits may continue to change as a result of new information and attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may include regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items. The federal government as well as a number of states (including California), counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritional information available to guests (including caloric, sugar, sodium and fat content) or have enacted legislation prohibiting the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. In December 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published its final rules on menu labeling, which implement section 4205 of the PPACA, to establish requirements for the nutrition labeling of standard menu items at restaurants with 20 or more locations. Under the rule, which is currently scheduled to become effective on May 5, 2017, calorie information must be provided clearly and conspicuously next to the listed standard menu item on a menu or menu board. In addition to calorie information, each menu or menu board must prominently include a succinct statement concerning suggested caloric intake. Upon request, covered establishments must provide information about the total calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, fiber, sugars, and protein in their standard menu items. The final rule contains detailed requirements for providing calorie and nutrition information and determining nutrient content. The effect of such labeling requirements on consumer choices, if any, is unclear at this time, and the implementation of such requirements may be costly.\nThe success of our restaurant operations depends, in part, upon our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations and to adapt our menu offerings to fit the dietary needs and eating habits of our guests without sacrificing flavor. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to our menu offerings, it could materially affect guest traffic and our results of operations. Furthermore, a change in our menu could result in a decrease in guest traffic.\nWe may be subject to increased scrutiny as the result of growing public concern over seafood mislabeling.\nAlthough we source our seafood from third-party food suppliers and distributors that we believe accurately identify and label the seafood items that they sell and inspect food products when they are delivered to us, we do not conduct DNA sampling on the products we purchase. Therefore, we cannot assure that the seafood items we purchase from third-parties have been accurately labeled, which could cause us to inadvertently mislabel such items in our restaurants. Recent studies have shown a number of instances of fish products being inaccurately labeled as other species in retail outlets, including grocery stores and restaurants. Although none of our restaurant brands were included in these studies, negative publicity regarding seafood mislabeling, even when not related to our restaurants, could affect consumer preferences and the consumption of seafood and consequently impact our sales. In addition, if any incident of seafood mislabeling were to occur at one of our restaurants, it could erode consumer affinity for our brands and significantly reduce their respective values and damage our business. Furthermore, public concern over seafood mislabeling could result in new regulations relating to the sourcing and labeling of seafood products. For instance, a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress in July 2012 that was intended to address seafood fraud by requiring fish suppliers and restaurants to provide more information to their customers about the seafood they sell. Although such bill was not enacted, future bills may be proposed and enacted and compliance with any such regulations could cause us to incur additional costs.\nWe occupy most of our restaurants under long-term non-cancelable leases which may obligate us to perform even after a restaurant closes, and we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms.\nAll of our restaurant locations are leased under individual lease agreements. Leases are noncancelable and in general, have 10- to 15-year terms, with 3- to 5-year extensions. If we were to close or fail to open a restaurant at a location we lease, we would generally remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which could include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Our obligation to continue making rental payments and fulfilling other lease obligations in respect of leases for closed or unopened restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Alternatively, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a restaurant, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we cannot renew such a lease we may be forced to close or relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks. If we are required to make payments in respect of leases for closed or unopened restaurants or if we are unable to renew our restaurant leases, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe impact of negative economic factors, including the availability of credit, on our landlords, developers and surrounding tenants could negatively affect our financial results.\nNegative effects on our existing and potential landlords due to the inaccessibility of credit and other unfavorable economic factors may, in turn, adversely affect our business and results of operations. If our landlords are unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, they may be unable to provide construction contributions or satisfy other lease obligations owed to us. In addition, if our landlords are unable to obtain sufficient credit to continue to properly manage their retail sites, we may experience a drop in the level of quality of such retail centers. Our development of new restaurants may also be adversely affected by the negative economic factors affecting developers and potential landlords. Developers and/or landlords may try to delay or cancel recent development projects (as well as renovations of existing projects) due to the instability in the credit markets and recent declines in consumer spending, which could reduce the number of appropriate locations available that we would consider for our new restaurants. If any of the foregoing affect any of our landlords, developers and/or surrounding tenants, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. To the extent our restaurants are part of a larger retail project or tourist destination, our guest traffic could be negatively impacted by economic factors affecting our surrounding tenants.\nWe have recorded impairment charges in past periods and may record additional impairment charges in future periods.\nWe periodically evaluate possible impairment of our intangible assets, as well as other fixed assets at the individual restaurant-level, and record an impairment loss whenever we determine that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying value. We also periodically evaluate the criteria we use as an indication of asset impairment. As a result of our annual impairment testing, we recorded aggregate impairment charges of $23.5 million, $9.4 million and $1.8 million in fiscal year 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to Joe\u2019s long-lived assets and impairment charges of $2.7 million in fiscal year 2016 related to Brick House\u2019s long-lived assets. If we are unable to improve the performance of our restaurants or if we experience deteriorating results at some of our restaurants, we could recognize additional impairment charges.\nOur current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe currently maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and property insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur failure or inability to enforce our trademarks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position or the value of our brand.\nOur registered trademarks and service marks include Joe\u2019s Crab Shack and the design, our stylized logos, and Brick House Tavern + Tap and the design, which are protected under applicable intellectual property laws. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position, and, therefore, we devote resources to the protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights. The protective actions that we take, however, may not be enough to prevent unauthorized use or imitation by others, which could harm our image, brand or competitive position. If we commence litigation to enforce our rights, we will incur significant legal fees.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not claim infringement by us of their proprietary rights in the future. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming and distracting for executive management, result in costly litigation, cause changes to existing menu items or delays in introducing new menu items, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing of new restaurant openings and related expense;\n\u2022\nrestaurant operating costs and expenses for our newly-opened restaurants, which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter;\n\u2022\nlabor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel;\n\u2022\nprofitability of our restaurants, especially in new markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nincreases and decreases in average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales;\n\u2022\nimpairment of long-lived assets and any loss on restaurant closures;\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions, both nationally and locally;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity relating to the consumption of seafood or other products we serve;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nexpansion to new markets;\n\u2022\nincreases in infrastructure costs; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in commodity prices.\nOur business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our revenues are typically highest in the summer months (June, July and August) and lowest in the winter months (November, December and January) with respect to Joe\u2019s restaurants. As a result, our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above. Accordingly, results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for any fiscal year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely decrease.\nSignificant adverse weather conditions and other disasters could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAdverse weather conditions and acts of god, such as regional winter storms, fires, floods, hurricanes, tropical storms and earthquakes, and other disasters, such as oil spills or other incidents involving hazardous materials, could negatively impact our results of operations. In particular, a number of our restaurants are located in states which are particularly susceptible to hurricanes, tropical storms, flooding and earthquakes.\nAny strategic transactions or initiatives that we consider in the future may have unanticipated consequences that could harm our business and our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions of restaurants joint ventures, dispositions of existing brands or other strategic initiatives to acquire or develop additional restaurant brands. To successfully execute any acquisition or development strategy, we will need to identify suitable acquisition or development candidates, negotiate acceptable acquisition or development terms and obtain appropriate financing. Any acquisition, disposition or future development that we pursue, whether or not successfully completed, may involve risks, including:\n\u2022\nmaterial adverse effects on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisition or development as the restaurants are integrated into our operations;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering into new domestic markets or conducting operations where we have no or limited prior experience, including international markets;\n\u2022\nrisks inherent in accurately assessing the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates and newly developed restaurant brands, and our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies;\n\u2022\nnegative impacts on the reputation of our current brands; and\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nWe are party to a franchise relationship and may pursue additional franchise relationships, and any current or future franchisees could take actions that could be harmful to our business.\nWe currently have three Joe\u2019s franchised locations in operation in Dubai, U.A.E. We may pursue additional international franchise relationships for both of our brands in the future. The addition of operations in foreign jurisdictions through franchising involves additional risks to us, including complying with foreign regulatory requirements and general economic and political conditions in such foreign markets, and we may be unsuccessful in complying with such requirements. Our ability to pursue future franchise relationships depends in part upon our ability to find and attract quality franchisees. Any franchisees will be contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with our standards and all applicable laws. However, although we will attempt to properly train and support any franchisees, franchisees are independent third parties that we will not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchised restaurant rests with the franchisee. Adverse events beyond our control, such as quality issues related to a food product or a failure to maintain quality standards at a franchised restaurant, could negatively impact our brand, business and results of operations. In addition, the failure of any future franchisees or any of their restaurants to remain financially viable could result in their failure to pay royalties owed to us.\nWe have incurred and may continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company.\nOngoing compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies require considerable time and attention of management, particularly if we are no longer a smaller reporting company or an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nCongress enacted the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the \u201cJOBS Act,\u201d on April 5, 2012. Pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Section 102 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we chose to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period was irrevocable.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Some investors may find our common stock less attractive if we continue to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe anticipate that we will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earlier of the end of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more and May 10, 2017.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nConcentration of ownership by J.H. Whitney VI may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nJ.H. Whitney VI owns, in the aggregate, approximately 66% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, J.H. Whitney VI is able to exercise control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions and will continue to have significant control over our management and policies. In addition, one of the six members of our board of directors is a principal of J.H. Whitney. J.H. Whitney VI can take actions that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. These actions may be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. The concentration of voting power with J.H. Whitney VI may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. The interests of J.H. Whitney VI may not be consistent with your interests as a stockholder. J.H. Whitney VI is also able to transfer control of us to a third-party by transferring their common stock, which would not require the approval of our board of directors or our other stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of corporate opportunity does not apply against J.H. Whitney, or any of our directors who are employees of or affiliated with J.H. Whitney, in a manner that would prohibit them from investing or participating in competing businesses. To the extent J.H. Whitney-affiliated funds invest in such other businesses, they may have differing interests than our other stockholders. For example, J.H. Whitney-affiliated funds may choose to own other restaurant brands through other investments, which may compete with our brands.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of The NASDAQ Stock Market rules, and, as a result, we rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies.\nJ.H. Whitney VI owns more than 50% of the total voting power of our common stock and therefore, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under The NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance listing standards. As a controlled company, we are exempt under The NASDAQ Stock Market listing standards from the obligation to comply with certain of The NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:\n\u2022\nthat a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors, as defined under the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market;\n\u2022\nthat we have a corporate governance and nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthat we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including those described under \u201cRisks Related to Our Business\u201d and the following:\n\u2022\npotential fluctuation in our annual or quarterly operating results due to seasonality and other factors;\n\u2022\nchanges in capital market conditions that could affect valuations of restaurant companies in general or our goodwill in particular or other adverse economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022\ndowngrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nglobal economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 perceptions of our prospects;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures or capital commitments; and\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives.\nIn addition, the stock markets, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many food service companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. J.H. Whitney VI has the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements registering additional shares of common stock, and J.H. Whitney VI and members of management have the right to require us to include shares of common stock in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or J.H. Whitney VI. Subject to compliance with restrictions under the registration rights agreement (which may be waived), shares of common stock sold under these registration statements can be freely sold in the public market. In the event such registration rights are exercised and a large number of shares of common stock are sold in the public market, such sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock. These sales also could impede our ability to raise future capital. In addition, we would incur certain expenses in connection with the registration and sale of such shares.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that stockholders might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors for a period of time after the consummation of the public offering, so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders, if J.H. Whitney VI owns less than 50% of our outstanding voting stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange and is quoted only on the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) market, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity.\nEffective March 15, 2017, our common stock trades exclusively on the OTC market under the symbol IRGT. The OTC market is a significantly more limited market than NASDAQ, and the quotation of our common stock on the OTC market may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock. This could further depress the trading price of our common stock and could also have a long-term adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We cannot provide any assurances as to if or when we will be in a position to relist our common stock on a nationally-recognized securities exchange.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nThe continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, including our senior secured credit facility and other indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.", "PERMNO": 13408, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "IRGTQ"}
