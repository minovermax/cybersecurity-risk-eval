Risk Factors.\nRisk Factors Summary\n\u2022Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our securities, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described in \u201cPart I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022We have incurred significant losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and may continue to incur net losses over the next several years.\n\u2022We may need substantial additional funding, and if we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\n\u2022We are substantially dependent on the success of our product candidates and we cannot guarantee that our product candidates will successfully complete development, receive regulatory approval, or be successfully commercialized.\n\u2022The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to it may result in disruptions to our business operations.\n\u2022Our product candidates generated from our modifier gene therapy platform are based on a novel technology and face an uncertain regulatory environment, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval.\n\u2022COVAXIN, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate that is the subject of our Covaxin Agreement with Bharat Biotech, is being evaluated by Bharat Biotech in a Phase 3 clinical trial in India and the regulatory path in the United States is currently being evaluated. We may be unable to successfully produce and commercialize a vaccine that effectively and safely treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all, and ultimately may be unable to obtain EUA or BLA approval in the United States.\n\u2022The regulatory pathway for COVAXIN is continually evolving, and may result in unexpected or unforeseen challenges.\n\u2022If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our completion of clinical trials and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\n\u2022We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\n\u2022We have no prior experience in the marketing, sale, and distribution of pharmaceutical products and there can be no assurance that our products, if approved, will be successfully commercialized.\n\u2022We face significant competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and other research organizations.\n\u2022We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct, supervise, and monitor our preclinical studies and any future clinical trials we may initiate, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or failing to comply with regulatory requirements.\n\u2022If the manufacturers upon whom we rely fail to produce our product candidates or components pursuant to the terms of contractual arrangements with us or fail to comply with stringent regulations applicable to biologic and pharmaceutical manufacturers, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of, or be unable to meet demand for, our product candidates and may lose potential revenues.\n\u2022We may seek to collaborate with third parties for the development or commercialization of our product candidates and we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining collaborative relationships, any of which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\n\u2022We may be unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and product candidates, or the scope of the patent protection obtained may not be sufficiently broad or enforceable, such that our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and product candidates may be impaired.\n\u2022Certain aspects of our product candidates are protected by patents exclusively licensed from other companies or institutions and if these third parties terminate their agreements with us or fail to maintain or enforce the underlying patents or licenses thereto, or we otherwise lose our rights to these patents, our competitive position and our market share in the markets for any of our approved products will be harmed.\n\u2022We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming, and unsuccessful.\n\u2022We have used almost all of our unreserved, authorized shares.\n\u2022Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\n\u2022Raising additional funding may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations, or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\n\u2022The trading price of the shares of our common stock could be highly volatile, and purchasers of the common stock could incur substantial losses.\n\u2022If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. We may incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant net losses and may continue to incur net losses in the future. We have not generated significant revenue to date and have funded our operations to date through the sale of common stock, warrants to purchase common stock, the issuance of convertible notes, debt, and grant proceeds. We incurred net losses of approximately $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $73.3 million and a cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balance of $24.2 million.\nTo date, we have not commercialized any products or generated any revenues from the sale of products, and absent the realization of sufficient revenues from product sales, if any, of our current or future product candidates, if authorized or approved, we may never attain profitability in the future. To date, we have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical and clinical studies. We may continue to incur losses from operations in the next several years as we increase our expenditures in research and development in connection with clinical trials and other development and commercialization activities. Even if we obtain an EUA or regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidates have received such authorization or approval, and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payors, and adequate market share for our products in those markets.\nWe anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in 2021 as compared to 2020 as we develop, seek an EUA for and potentially commercialize COVAXIN in the United States and prepare to commence human clinical trials with respect to OCU400, OCU410, and OCU200. Our expenses will increase as a result of increased headcount, including management personnel to support our research and development and clinical activities, expanded infrastructure, and increased insurance premiums, among other factors.\nDue to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development and the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with such activities, we are unable to predict with any certainty the nature or amounts of the costs we will incur, the timelines we will require in our continued development efforts or the timing, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability.\nAdditionally, our expenses will also increase if, and, as we:\n\u2022initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional product candidates that we may pursue in the future, particularly if there are any delays in enrollment of patients in or completing our clinical trials or the development of our product candidates;\n\u2022seek marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical development;\n\u2022establish sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for our product candidates for which we obtain an EUA or marketing approval;\n\u2022scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support our clinical trials of our product candidates and commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain an EUA or marketing approval;\n\u2022expand our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts, and our operations as a public company;\n\u2022hire additional clinical, quality control, and scientific personnel;\n\u2022acquire other companies, products, product candidates, or technologies, or in-license the rights to other products, product candidates, or technologies; and\n\u2022develop, maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. We do not expect to generate revenue that is sufficient to achieve profitability unless and until we obtain an EUA or marketing approval for and commercialize one of our product candidates. Our product candidates are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development and it may be several years before we obtain regulatory approval for any candidate, if ever. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become profitable or inability to remain profitable would decrease the value of the company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain\nour research and development efforts, continue or undertake commercialization efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of the company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have a limited operating history and no history of commercializing pharmaceutical products, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative endeavor. Biopharmaceutical product development entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and there is significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, to gain any required regulatory approvals or to become commercially viable. To date, our operations have been limited to organizing and staffing the company, acquiring rights to intellectual property, business planning, raising capital, and developing our product candidates. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial-scale product, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nWe have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in a rapidly developing and changing industry, such as the biopharmaceutical industry, including challenges in forecasting accuracy, determining appropriate investments of our limited resources, gaining market acceptance of our products, if authorized or approved, managing a complex regulatory landscape, and developing new product candidates. Our current operating model may require changes in order for us to scale our operations efficiently. We will need to transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we face as a company focused on developing products in the fields of biopharmaceuticals and biotechnology.\nWe expect our financial condition and operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, you should not rely upon the results of any quarterly or annual periods as indications of future operating performance.\nWe may need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect to devote substantial financial resources to our ongoing and planned product development activities, particularly as we commence development and commercialization activities with respect to COVAXIN in the United States and continue the development of and potentially seek marketing approval for other product candidates, including OCU400, OCU410, OCU200, and any potential future product candidates. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of approximately $24.2 million, and since that date we have received net proceeds of $4.8 million from the sale of our common stock in an at-the-market offering and $21.2 million from the sale of our common stock in a registered direct offering. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least one year from the date the consolidated financial statements included in this report are issued. However, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We cannot predict when we will be able to generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval of products with the market potential sufficient to enable us to achieve profitability, if ever. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the progress, costs, and results of any clinical trials for our product candidates, and any clinical activities for regulatory review of our product candidates outside of the United States;\n\u2022the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our preclinical product candidates;\n\u2022the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up activities associated with our product candidates, if we receive, or expect to receive, and EUA or marketing approval;\n\u2022the costs of commercialization activities for our product candidates if we receive, or expect to receive, an EUA or marketing approval, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution, and outsourced manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022subject to receipt of an EUA or marketing approval, revenue received from commercial sales of our product candidates;\n\u2022our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing, or other agreements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u2022the scope, progress, results, and costs of any additional product candidates that we may derive from our modifier gene therapy platform or any other product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates, or technologies; and\n\u2022the costs and timing of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights, and defending against any intellectual property-related claims.\nAny additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Moreover, adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate preclinical studies, clinical trials, or other development activities for one or more of our product candidates or delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe may need additional funding in order to enable us to successfully develop COVAXIN, and such funding may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. The commitment of substantial resources to this program entails additional risks.\nWe may need additional funding in order to enable us to successfully develop and obtain FDA authorization or approval and have sufficient capacity to manufacture, commercialize, and distribute COVAXIN, if authorized or approved by the FDA. Such funding may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, our commitment of substantial financial resources and personnel to the joint development of a vaccine candidate entails additional risks. In particular, this commitment may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs, despite uncertainties surrounding the longevity and extent of COVID-19 as a global health concern. Our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to a global health threat that is unpredictable and could rapidly dissipate.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nWe expect to raise additional capital through public and private placements of equity and/or debt, payments from potential strategic research and development, sale of assets, government grants, licensing and/or collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical companies or other institutions, and other funding from the government. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Such arrangements may require us to grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market on our own.\nOur existing and future indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had incurred indebtedness consisting of (i) $0.4 million of outstanding principal borrowings from Silicon Valley Bank (\"SVB\") under the Paycheck Protection Program (the \"PPP\") of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\"), which matures on April 30, 2022 and bears interest at a rate of 1% per annum, payable monthly commencing on either the date the Small Business Administration (the \"SBA\") compensates SVB for any forgiven amounts or 10 months after the end of our covered period under the PPP, which ended in October 2020 and (ii) $1.5 million of outstanding principal borrowings under a Loan Agreement (the \"EB-5 Loan Agreement\") with EB5 Life Sciences, L.P. (\"EB-5 Life Sciences\"), which we are required to repay on the seventh anniversary of the date of the last disbursement under the EB-5 Loan Agreement (unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the EB-5 Loan Agreement). Our obligations under the EB-5 Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets other than our intellectual property. We could in the future incur additional indebtedness beyond our borrowings under the PPP of the CARES Act and our borrowings under the EB-5 Loan Agreement.\nOur existing or future debt could have significant adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations or cash on hand to the payment of interest on, and principal of, our debt, which will reduce the amounts available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry, and market conditions;\n\u2022subjecting us to restrictive covenants that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions or obtain further debt or equity financing (for instance, the EB-5 Loan Agreement includes restrictive covenants related to, among other things, the disposition of our property, the incurrence by us of any additional indebtedness, and the creation by us of any liens or other encumbrances);\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options.\nA failure to comply with the covenants under the EB-5 Loan Agreement, including covenants to take or avoid specific actions as set forth above, could result in an event of default and acceleration of amounts due. If an event of default occurs and EB-5 Life Sciences accelerates the amounts due under the EB-5 Loan Agreement, we may not be able to make accelerated payments, and EB-5 Life Sciences could seek to enforce security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness.\nAll or a portion of our borrowings under the PPP of the CARES Act may be forgiven by the SBA. We will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest and we cannot provide any assurance that any amount of our borrowings under the PPP of the CARES Act will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA. If we are unable to obtain forgiveness of all or any portion of our borrowings under the PPP of the CARES Act, our liquidity could be reduced and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn order to satisfy our current and future debt service obligations, we will be required to raise funds from external sources. We may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay the amounts due under our existing debt. Funds from external sources may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to satisfy our current and future debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to use carryforward tax losses or benefit from favorable tax legislation to reduce our taxes, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred significant net operating losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2020, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $128.0 million and $126.7 million, respectively. If we are unable to use carryforward tax losses to reduce our future taxable income and liabilities in our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which will occur if there is a cumulative change in ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change net operating losses equal to the value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation for a taxable year generally is increased by the amount of any \u201crecognized built-in gains\u201d for such year and the amount of any unused annual limitation in a prior year. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities.\nRecent and any potential future U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecently-enacted U.S. tax legislation has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations, including by reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions generally referred to as \u201corphan drugs\u201d), adopting elements of a territorial tax system, imposing a one-time transition tax, or repatriation tax, on all undistributed earnings and profits of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations, revising the rules governing net operating losses and the rules governing foreign tax credits, and introducing new\nanti-base erosion provisions. Many of these changes are effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. The legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.\nFurthermore, it is also possible that there will be technical corrections or other legislation proposed with respect to the tax reform legislation, the effect of which cannot be predicted and may be adverse to us or our stockholders. Further, the new presidential administration in 2021 may result in additional amendments to the Code or reversal of the 2017 changes.\nWhile some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. We continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us. We urge our investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation.\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Development of Our Product Candidates\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our product candidates. We cannot guarantee that our product candidates will successfully complete development, receive regulatory approval, or be successfully commercialized.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our product candidates. Notwithstanding such investment, we currently have no products approved for commercial distribution and we generate no revenues from sales of any products. Our business and our ability to generate revenues in the near term depends entirely on the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates, which may never occur. Our product candidates are susceptible to the risks of failure inherent at any stage of product development, including the appearance of unexpected or unacceptable adverse events or failure to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials, and our product candidates may not be successfully commercialized even if they receive regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates are various stages of development ranging from preclinical development to late-stage clinical development.\nThe success of our product candidates and our ability to generate revenues from our product candidates will depend on many factors including our ability to:\n\u2022complete and obtain favorable results from our clinical and preclinical trials with respect to our product candidates;\n\u2022apply for and receive marketing approval from the applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022receive regulatory approval for claims that are necessary or desirable for successful marketing;\n\u2022receive approval for our manufacturing processes and third-party manufacturing facilities from the applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022recruit and enroll qualified patients for clinical trials with respect to our product candidates in a timely manner;\n\u2022expand and maintain a workforce of experienced scientists and others with experience in the relevant technology to continue to develop our product candidates;\n\u2022hire, train, and deploy marketing and sales representatives or contract with a third-party for marketing and sales representatives to commercialize product candidates in the United States;\n\u2022launch and create market demand for our product candidates through marketing and sales activities, and any other arrangements to promote these product candidates that we may otherwise establish;\n\u2022achieve market acceptance of our product candidates by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022effectively compete with other therapies and establish a market share;\n\u2022maintain a continued acceptable safety and efficacy profile of our product candidates following commercial launch;\n\u2022achieve appropriate reimbursement, pricing, and payment coverage for our product candidates;\n\u2022manufacture product candidates in sufficient quantities and at acceptable quality and manufacturing cost to meet commercial demand at launch and thereafter;\n\u2022establish and maintain agreements with wholesalers, distributors, and group purchasing organizations on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022pursue partnerships with, or offer licenses to, qualified third parties to promote and sell product candidates in domestic and key foreign markets where we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022develop our product candidates for additional indications or for use in broader patient populations;\n\u2022maintain patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;\n\u2022qualify for, identify, register, maintain, enforce and defend intellectual property rights and claims covering our products and intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u2022not infringe on others\u2019 intellectual property rights.\nTo the extent we are not able to do any of the foregoing, our business may be materially harmed. If we do not receive FDA approval for, and successfully commercialize our product candidates, we will not be able to generate revenue from these product candidates in the United States in the foreseeable future or at all.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming, and inherently unpredictable. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates as expected, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, which regulations differ from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials. The outcome of the approval process is inherently uncertain and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. This is especially true for rare and/or complicated diseases. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. We cannot predict if or when we might receive regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates currently under development. Any delay in our obtaining or our failure to obtain required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from the particular product candidate, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.\nSecuring marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy for that indication. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites by the regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for regulatory approval also varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. The FDA or other similar regulatory authorities may determine that our product candidates are not effective or only moderately effective (e.g., studies may not produce the necessary result on all study endpoints), that our studies failed to reach the necessary level of statistical significance, or that our product candidates have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022regulators, including the FDA and the NIH, or IRBs or IBCs may not authorize us or our investigators to commence or continue a clinical trial, conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site, or amend trial protocols, or regulators, IRBs or IBCs may require that we modify or amend our clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites and our CROs;\n\u2022the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or be lost to follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or the clinical trial protocol, or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or we may be required to engage in additional clinical trial site monitoring;\n\u2022us, the regulators, IRBs or IBCs may require the suspension or termination of clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects, or other unexpected characteristics (alone or in combination with other products) of the product candidate, or due to findings of undesirable effects caused by a chemically or mechanistically similar therapeutic or therapeutic candidate;\n\u2022changes in marketing approval policies or regulations, or changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, during the development period rendering our data insufficient to obtain marketing approval and requiring us to conduct additional studies;\n\u2022the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate or we may have insufficient funds for a clinical trial or to pay the substantial user fees required by the FDA upon the filing of a marketing application;\n\u2022the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate;\n\u2022we may have delays in adding new investigators or clinical trial sites, or we may experience a withdrawal of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022patients that enroll in our studies may misrepresent their eligibility or may otherwise not comply with the clinical trial protocol, resulting in the need to drop the patients from the study, increase the needed enrollment size for the study or extend the study\u2019s duration;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our study design, including endpoints, or our interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials or find that a product candidate\u2019s benefits do not outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from studies with clinical trial sites in foreign countries;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our intended indications;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or our contract manufacturer\u2019s manufacturing facility for clinical and future commercial supplies;\n\u2022the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to support the submission of a marketing application, or other comparable submissions in foreign jurisdictions or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may take longer than we anticipate to make a decision on its product candidates; and\n\u2022we may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate provides an advantage over current standards of care or current or future competitive therapies in development.\nSignificant delays relating to any preclinical or clinical trials also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do. This may prevent us from receiving marketing approvals and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, delays in clinical trials may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of any of our product candidates. If any of this occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be materially harmed.\nThe failure to comply with FDA and comparable foreign regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, if any, subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or planned trials\u037e\n\u2022restrictions on our products, manufacturers, or manufacturing process\u037e\n\u2022warning letters, Form 483s, or untitled letters alleging violations\u037e\n\u2022civil and criminal penalties\u037e\n\u2022injunctions\u037e\n\u2022suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals\u037e\n\u2022product seizures, detentions, or import bans\u037e\n\u2022voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements\u037e\n\u2022total or partial suspension of production\u037e\n\u2022imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements\u037e and\n\u2022refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements to approved marketing applications.\nEven if we were to obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may grant approval for fewer or more limited indications, populations, or uses than we request, may require significant safety warnings, including black box warnings, contraindications, and precautions, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, surveillance, restrictions on use or other requirements, including a REMS to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of these scenarios could compromise the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to it may result in disruptions to our business operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread to multiple countries, including the United States and several European countries. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Further, the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency. The Governor of Pennsylvania declared a state of emergency and has issued orders impacting our business operations.\nWe currently expect to commence two Phase 1/2a clinical trials for OCU400, our product candidate for the treatment of multiple IRDs, in the United States in the second half of 2021. If COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States and elsewhere, it may delay enrollment in these planned clinical trials, and in any clinical trials that we may commence for our other product candidates in 2022. Some patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if any future quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Moreover, limitations on global international travel may delay key trial activities, including necessary interactions with regulators, ethics committees, and other important agencies and contractors. We may be faced with limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people. Any of the above could delay our planned clinical trials for OCU400 or prevent us from completing these clinical trials at all, and harm our ability to obtain approval for OCU400 or our other product candidates.\nMoreover, we may experience additional disruptions that could severely impact our business and development activities, including, but not limited to, strain on our suppliers and other third parties, possibly resulting in supply disruptions of our product candidates for preclinical development and potential future clinical trials we expect to initiate, decrease in clinical enrollment in any clinical trials we initiate, and the ability to raise capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. Disruptions in our operations or supply chain, whether as a result of restricted travel, quarantine requirements, or otherwise, could negatively impact our ability to proceed with our clinical trials, preclinical development, and other activities and delay our ability to receive product approval and generate revenue.\nIn addition, the continued spread of COVID-19 may lead to severe disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. It is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 could cause an economic slowdown or recession or cause other unpredictable events, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the emergence of any new mutations or variants of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions imposed by the United States and other countries, business closures or\nbusiness disruption in the United States and other countries, and the actions taken throughout the world, including in our markets, to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, our preclinical development efforts, healthcare systems, or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nCOVAXIN, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate that is the subject of the Covaxin Agreement with Bharat Biotech, is being evaluated by Bharat Biotech in a Phase 3 clinical trial in India and the regulatory path in the United States is currently being evaluated. We may be unable to successfully produce and commercialize a vaccine that effectively and safely treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all, and ultimately may be unable to obtain emergency use authorization or regulatory approval in the United States.\nIn February 2021, we entered into the Covaxin Agreement, with Bharat Biotech, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive right and license under certain of Bharat Biotech\u2019s intellectual property rights, with the right to grant sublicenses, to develop, manufacture, and commercialize COVAXIN, a whole-virion inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate, in the United States of America, its territories and possessions. COVAXIN has been granted approval for emergency use in India. A Phase 3 clinical trial is ongoing in India and enrollment is complete. COVAXIN demonstrated a vaccine efficacy of 81% in the first interim analysis of the Phase 3 clinical trial. Notwithstanding receipt of the approval for emergency use in India, Bharat Biotech\u2019s development efforts in India remain subject to ongoing clinical trials. Bharat Biotech may be unable to develop or produce a vaccine that successfully vaccinates against the SARS-CoV-2 virus or emerging variants of the virus. Moreover, subjects receiving COVAXIN in Bharat Biotech\u2019s clinical trials, as well as patients receiving the vaccine under the emergency use approval in India, may experience allergic reactions or other adverse events, which could adversely impact the U.S. market\u2019s perception of the vaccine. Any of these events could materially impair our ability to develop COVAXIN in the United States.\nOur development efforts with respect to the U.S. market are in their initial stages, and we may be unable to obtain authorization or approval of COVAXIN in the United States, in a timely manner, if at all. We have initiated discussions with the FDA but no EUA application has been submitted at this time. The FDA may determine that the studies conducted in India were not done in compliance with FDA regulations, including GCP regulations. For this and other reasons, the FDA may not accept data from the studies conducted with COVAXIN at clinical trial sites in India and may require us to conduct clinical studies in the United States before considering an application for an EUA in the United States. Even if we conduct clinical trials in the United States, we may not be successful in obtaining an EUA from the FDA if our development efforts were to result in findings relating to a lack of efficacy, safety concerns, or other issues. Our inability to obtain an EUA from the FDA could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs an organization, we have no experience in the development, manufacturing, distribution or commercialization of a vaccine candidate.\nWe have never undertaken the development, manufacturing, distribution, or commercialization of a vaccine candidate, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory authorization or approval in the United States. Additionally, development of an effective vaccine candidate depends on the success of our and our partner\u2019s manufacturing capabilities. We have not previously ramped our organization for a commercial launch of any product, and doing so in a pandemic environment with an urgent, critical global need creates additional challenges such as clinical trials, licensing, distribution channels, intellectual property disputes or challenges, and the need to establish teams of people with the relevant skills. We may also face challenges with sourcing a sufficient amount of raw materials to support the demand for a vaccine, including any potential import issues. We may be unable to effectively create a supply chain for COVAXIN that will adequately support demand. Furthermore, there are no assurances that any vaccine candidate would be approved or authorized by the FDA at all or for inclusion in government stockpile programs, which may be material to the commercial success of a vaccine product candidate, in the United States.\nThe regulatory pathway for COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including COVAXIN, is continually evolving, and may result in unexpected or unforeseen challenges.\nCOVAXIN has moved rapidly through the regulatory review process for emergency use in India. We cannot predict the speed at which we will be able to obtain authorization or approval of COVAXIN in the United States, if at all. Evolving or changing plans or priorities at the FDA, including changes based on new knowledge of COVID-19 and how the disease affects the human body, may significantly affect the regulatory pathway and timeline for COVAXIN authorization or approval in the United States. The FDA may not accept data from the studies conducted with COVAXIN at clinical trial sites in India and may require additional clinical trials. Any results from further clinical testing may raise new questions and require us to redesign proposed clinical trials, including revising proposed endpoints or adding new clinical trial sites or cohorts of subjects. In addition, the FDA\u2019s analysis of any clinical data may differ from our interpretation and the FDA may require that we conduct additional\nanalysis or trials. Further, the ongoing Phase 3 trial in India may demonstrate that the vaccine candidate is ineffective or has an unacceptable safety profile.\nThe FDA has the authority to grant an EUA to allow unapproved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. If we are granted an EUA by the FDA for COVAXIN, we would be able to commercialize it without FDA approval. However, the FDA may revoke the EUA where it is determined that the COVID-19 public health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, and we cannot predict how long, if ever, an EUA would remain in place. Such revocation could adversely impact our business in a variety of ways, including if COVAXIN is not yet approved by the FDA and if we, Bharat Biotech and our manufacturing partners have invested in the supply chain to provide COVAXIN under an EUA in the United States. In addition, the FDA may revoke or terminate the EUA sooner if, for example, we fail to comply with the conditions of authorization or other terms of the EUA or if COVAXIN is determined to be less effective or safe than it was initially believed to be. We cannot predict how long, if ever, an EUA would remain in place.\nOur ability to produce a successful vaccine may be curtailed by one or more government actions or interventions, which may be more likely during a global health crisis such as COVID-19.\nGiven the significant global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that the U.S. government may take actions that directly or indirectly have the effect of diminishing some of our rights or opportunities with respect to COVAXIN and the economic value of a COVID-19 vaccine to us could be limited. In the United States, the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, or the Defense Production Act, gives the U.S. government rights and authorities that may directly or indirectly diminish our own rights or opportunities with respect to COVAXIN and the economic value of a COVID-19 vaccine to us could be limited. Our potential third-party service providers may be impacted by government entities regarding potentially invoking the Defense Production Act or other potential restrictions to all or a portion of services they might otherwise offer. Government entities imposing restrictions or limitations on our third-party service providers may require us to obtain alternative service sources for our vaccine candidate, including COVAXIN. If we are unable to timely enter into alternative arrangements, or if such alternative arrangements are not available on satisfactory terms, we will experience delays in the development or production of our vaccine candidate, increased expenses, and delays in potential distribution or commercialization of our vaccine candidate, when and if approved.\nOur product candidates generated from our modifier gene therapy platform are based on a novel technology and face an uncertain regulatory environment, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval.\nA substantial portion of our product research and development efforts is centered around our modifier gene therapy platform. The regulatory approval and successful commercialization of product candidates such as OCU400, a gene therapy designed to treat RP and other IRDs, and OCU410, a gene therapy designed to treat dry AMD, depend on the successful development of this platform. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our modifier gene therapy platform will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. The clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA, and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use and market of such product candidates. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as OCU400 and OCU410 can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates.\nRegulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. For example, the FDA established the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (\u201cCBER\u201d) to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. Gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. NIH, are also subject to review by the NIH Novel and Exceptional Technology and Research Advisory Committee (\u201cNExTRAC\u201d), formerly the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, which now focuses on emerging areas of research including, but not restricted to, technologies surrounding advances in recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid research. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, it is possible the NExTRAC review process, which is still being implemented, could delay the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial design and details and approved its initiation. Before a clinical trial can begin at a study site, the institution\u2019s IRB, and its IBC, have to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other regulatory bodies to change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates.\nThese regulatory review committees and advisory groups and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates, or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance our gene therapy product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups, and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our gene therapy product candidates. These additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected for orphan ophthalmology product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue to maintain our business.\nExisting data on the safety and efficacy of gene therapy is very limited and sometimes include historically poor clinical efficacy of previous non-replicating gene therapy products. In addition, there have been publicized safety issues associated with previous gene therapy products in third-party clinical trials, including patient deaths. The results of preclinical and clinical trials performed for our product candidates will not definitively predict safety or efficacy in humans. OCU400 and OCU410 use an AAV vector. Possible serious side effects of other viral vector-based gene therapies in general include uncontrolled viral infections and the development of cancer, particularly lymphoma or leukemia. The risk of insertional mutagenesis or oncogenesis remains a significant concern for gene therapy, and we cannot provide any assurance that it will not occur in any of our planned or future clinical trials with respect to our product candidates based on our modifier gene therapy platform. There is also the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biological activity of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material. Potential procedure-related adverse reactions, including inflammation, can also occur. If any such adverse events occur during clinical trials, further advancement of such clinical trials could be halted or delayed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFinally, public attitudes may be influenced by claims that gene therapy technology is unsafe, unethical, or immoral. If we are unable to convincingly demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates arising from our gene modifier platform, our product candidates, even if approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community.\nThe development and manufacture of biologics is a complex process and entails particular risks.\nOCU200, our product candidate currently in preclinical development, is a novel biologic designed to treat retinal diseases. The process of developing and manufacturing biologics is complex, highly regulated, and subject to multiple risks, and we have no experience in successfully developing, manufacturing, or commercializing a biologics product. The manufacturing of biologics is highly susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics, and difficulties in scaling the production process. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions, and higher costs.\nThe raw materials required in our third-party vendors\u2019 manufacturing processes are derived from biological sources. We cannot assure you that our third-party vendors have, or will be able to obtain on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, sufficient rights to these materials derived from biological sources. Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may also be subject to contamination or recall. If microbial, viral, or other contaminations are discovered at the facilities of our manufacturer, such facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination, which could delay clinical trials, result in higher costs of drug product, and adversely harm our business. A material shortage, recall, or restriction on the use of biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our product candidates could adversely impact or disrupt the clinical and commercial manufacturing of our product candidates, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and development timelines.\nIn addition, our biologics product candidates may expose us to additional potential product liability claims. The development of biologics products entails a risk of additional product liability claims because of the risk of transmitting disease to human recipients, and substantial product liability claims may be asserted against us as a result.\nOCU400 has received four ODDs from the FDA and two OMPDs from the European Commission. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain these designations, receive this designation for any of our other product candidates, or receive or maintain any corresponding benefits, including periods of exclusivity.\nWe have obtained from the FDA Office of Orphan Products ODDs for OCU400 for NR2E3, CEP290, RHO, and PDE6\u00df mutation-associated inherited retinal degenerations. OCU400 additionally received OMPD from the European Commission,\nbased on the recommendation of the EMA, for RP and LCA in February 2021. We may also seek ODD or OMPD for our other product candidates, as appropriate. While these ODDs and OMPDs provide us with certain advantages, they neither shorten the development time or regulatory review time of a product candidate nor give the product candidate any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nGenerally, if a product candidate with ODD subsequently receives marketing approval before another product considered by the FDA or EMA to be the same, for the same orphan indication, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or EMA from approving another marketing application for the same drug or biologic for the same indication for a specified time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and 10 years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a product no longer meets the criteria for OMPD or if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.\nWe may not be able to obtain any future ODDs or OMPDs that we apply for, ODDs or OMPDs do not guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop our product candidates, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain any ODDs or OMPDs that we receive. For instance, ODDs may be revoked if the FDA finds that the request for designation contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted material information, or if the FDA finds that the product candidate was not eligible for designation at the time of the submission of the request.\nMoreover, even if we are able to receive and maintain ODDs or OMPDs, we may ultimately not receive any period of regulatory exclusivity if our product candidates are approved. For instance, we may not receive orphan product regulatory exclusivity if the indication for which we receive FDA or EMA regulatory approval is different than the ODD or OMPD. Orphan exclusivity may also be lost for the same reasons that ODD or OMPD may be lost. Orphan exclusivity may further be lost if we are unable to assure a sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nEven if we obtain orphan exclusivity for any of our current or future product candidates, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition as different products can be approved for the same condition or products that are the same as ours can be approved for different conditions. Even after an orphan product is approved, the FDA or EMA can also subsequently approve a product containing the same principal molecular features for the same condition if the regulatory authority concludes that the later product is clinically superior by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care.\nIf another sponsor receives approval for such product before we do, we would be prevented from launching our product for the orphan indication during the period of marketing exclusivity unless we can demonstrate clinical superiority.\nIn the future we may seek FDA designations to facilitate product candidate development, such as fast track or breakthrough designation. We may not receive any such designations or if we receive such designations they may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nIn the future, we may seek product designations, such as fast track or breakthrough designation, which are intended to facilitate the development or regulatory review or approval process for product candidates. Receipt of such a designation is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for a designation, the FDA may disagree. In any event, the receipt of such a designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review, or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate marketing approval by the FDA. In addition, the FDA may later decide that the product candidates no longer meet the designation conditions, in which case any granted designations may be revoked.\nThe FDA may determine that our product candidates have undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization. If such side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may need to abandon our development of such product candidates.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us, IRBs, and other reviewing entities or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. For example, if concerns are raised regarding the safety of one of our product candidates as a result of undesirable side effects identified during clinical or preclinical testing, the FDA may order us to cease further development or issue a letter requesting additional data or information prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve the product candidate. FDA requests for additional data or information can result in substantial delays in the approval of a new product candidate.\nUndesirable side effects caused by or any unexpected characteristics (alone or in combination with other products) for any of our product candidates could also result in denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities for any or all targeted indications or the inclusion of unfavorable information in our product labeling, such as limitations on the indicated uses or populations for which the products may be marketed or distributed, a label with significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings, contraindications, and precautions, a label without statements necessary or desirable for successful commercialization, or may result in requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance, or other requirements, including REMS, to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products. These could prevent us from commercializing and generating revenues from the sale of our product candidates.\nMany compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. In addition, adverse events which had initially been considered unrelated to the study treatment may later be found to be caused by the study treatment. Moreover, incorrect or improper use of our product candidates (including use more frequently than is prescribed) by patients could cause unexpected side effects or adverse events. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will be used correctly, and if used incorrectly, such misuse could prevent our receipt or maintenance of marketing authorization, resulting in label changes or regulatory authority safety communications or warnings, or hamper commercial adoption of our product candidate, if approved, at the rate we currently expect.\nIf any of our product candidates are associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or have properties that are unexpected, we may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe, or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. The therapeutic-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. We may also be held liable for harm caused to patients and our reputation may suffer. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our completion of clinical trials and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our product candidates. Our two planned Phase 1/2a clinical studies for OCU400 could be discontinued early if they experience slow enrollment, and we may also experience similar difficulties in future clinical trials for our other product candidates currently in preclinical development. If patients are unwilling to participate in our clinical trials because of negative publicity from adverse events related to gene therapy or in the industry more broadly, in the clinical trials for related third party product candidates, or for other reasons, including competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting studies, and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, delays in testing the effectiveness of our product candidates, or termination of the clinical trials altogether.\nWe or our clinical trial sites may not be able to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with the required or desired characteristics in a clinical trial, to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u2022the size and nature of the patient population (for instance, we are pursuing clinical trials for certain orphan indications, for which the size of the patient population is limited);\n\u2022the severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022the existence of current treatments for the indications for which we are conducting clinical trials;\n\u2022the eligibility criteria for and design of the clinical trial in question, including factors such as frequency of required assessments, length of the study, and ongoing monitoring requirements;\n\u2022the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate, including the potential advantages or disadvantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies;\n\u2022competition in recruiting and enrolling patients in clinical trials;\n\u2022efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022effectiveness of publicity created by clinical trial sites regarding the trial;\n\u2022patients\u2019 ability to comply with the specific instructions related to the trial protocol, proper documentation, and use of the product candidate;\n\u2022an inability to obtain or maintain patient informed consents;\n\u2022the risk that enrolled patients will drop out before completion or not return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\u2022the ability to compensate patients for their time and effort; and\n\u2022the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue conducting clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. In particular, there may be low or slow enrollment, and the studies may enroll subjects that do not meet the inclusion criteria, requiring the erroneously enrolled subjects to be excluded and the trial population to be increased. Moreover, patients in our clinical trials, especially patients in our control groups, may be at risk for dropping out of our studies if they are not experiencing relief of their disease. A significant number of withdrawn patients would compromise the quality of a study's data.\nEnrollment difficulties or delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, or the inability to complete development of our product candidates, which would cause our value to decline, limit our ability to obtain additional financing, and materially impair our ability to generate revenues.\nData from preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may not be predictive of success in later clinical trials.\nThe results of preclinical studies, preliminary study results, and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials or the ultimately completed trial. Preliminary and final results from such studies may not be representative of study results that are found in larger, controlled, blinded, and more long-term studies. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the clinical trial protocols, and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may publish interim, \u201ctop-line,\u201d initial, or preliminary data from our clinical studies. Interim data from clinical trials are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data becomes available. Preliminary, initial, or \u201ctop-line\u201d data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data previously published. As a result, interim, \u201ctop-line\u201d, initial, and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Adverse changes between preliminary, initial, \u201ctop-line\u201d or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing, or other royalty arrangements in cases in which we would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nWe may in the future conduct clinical trials for product candidates at sites outside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations.\nWe may in the future choose to conduct one or more of our clinical trials outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of these data is subject to conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and be performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles, such as IRB or ethics committee approval and informed consent. The trial population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws (and therefore failure to comply with such laws could result in regulatory enforcement action), acceptance of the data by the FDA will be dependent upon its determination that the trials were conducted consistent with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and could delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable product candidates. For example, the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of COVAXIN were conducted in India and a Phase 3 clinical trial is currently ongoing there. The FDA may not accept data from the studies conducted with COVAXIN at clinical trial sites in India, and instead require clinical trials be conducted in the United States.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our products in jurisdictions outside the United States, we must obtain separate marketing approvals in international jurisdictions and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedures vary among countries and the time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. Our clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support an application for marketing approval outside the United States. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming.\nWe do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including in international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. We, or any eventual collaborators, may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may compromise our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nAdditionally, in June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. In March 2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. In October 2019, the United Kingdom and European Union agreed upon the terms of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the E.U. in the form of a Withdrawal Agreement. The Withdrawal Agreement was ratified by the U.K Parliament, and the European Parliament in Brussels, in late January 2020, with the consequence that Brexit formally occurred on January 31, 2020. The 11-month transition period ended on December 31, 2020. Following the transition period, the United Kingdom is no longer a part of the single market and customs union of the E.U. In December 2020, the United Kingdom and E.U. announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues. However, this deal may not avoid all disruption resulting from Brexit. Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from European Union directives and regulations, the withdrawal could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the approval of our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the European Union. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the United Kingdom and/or the European Union and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and/or European Union for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions, or other enforcement actions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses, resulting in damage to our reputation and business.\nWe must comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to therapeutics are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and continuing review by the FDA, Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress, and the public. When the FDA or comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities issue regulatory approval for a product candidate, the regulatory approval is limited to those specific uses and indications for which a product is approved. We may not market or promote them for other indications and uses, referred to as off-label uses. We further must be able to sufficiently substantiate any claims that we make for our products including claims comparing our products to other companies\u2019 products and must abide by the FDA\u2019s strict requirements regarding the content of promotion and advertising. While physicians may choose to prescribe products for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, we are prohibited from marketing and promoting the products for indications and uses that are not specifically approved by the FDA.\nIf we are found to have impermissibly promoted any of our product candidates, we may become subject to significant liability and government fines. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations regarding product promotion, particularly those prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted a product may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nIn the United States, engaging in the impermissible promotion of our products, following approval, for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims and other litigation under federal and state statutes, including fraud and abuse and consumer protection laws. Such litigation can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines, agreements with governmental authorities that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute therapeutic products and do business through, for example, corporate integrity agreements, suspension or exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts. These false claims statutes include the federal civil FCA, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a company on behalf of the federal government (\"qui tam\" action) alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing others to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government decides to intervene and prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in the proceeds from any fines or settlement funds. If the government declines to intervene, the individual may pursue the case alone. These FCA lawsuits against sponsors of drugs and biologics have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements, up to $3.0 billion, pertaining to certain sales practices and promoting off-label uses. In addition, FCA lawsuits may expose sponsors to follow-on claims by private payors based on fraudulent marketing practices. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that companies will have to defend a false claim action, and pay settlements fines or restitution, as well as criminal and civil penalties, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully promote our approved products, if any, we may become subject to such litigation and, if we do not successfully defend against such actions, those actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn the United States, the distribution of product samples to physicians must further comply with the requirements of the U.S. PDMA, and the promotion of biologic and pharmaceutical products are subject to additional FDA requirements and restrictions on promotional statements. If the FDA determines that our promotional activities violate our regulations and policies pertaining to product promotion, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or other enforcement actions, including issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, requests for recalls, payment of civil fines, disgorgement of money, imposition of operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, and other enforcement actions. These regulatory and enforcement actions could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to extensive and ongoing requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including requirements related to the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, recordkeeping, export, import, advertising, marketing, and promotional activities for such product. These requirements further include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information, including manufacturing deviations and reports, registration and listing requirements, the payment of annual fees, continued compliance with current GMPs or current GMP-requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance, and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and GCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval.\nEven if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses and populations for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including significant safety warnings,\nsuch as boxed warnings, contraindications, and precautions that are not desirable for successful commercialization. Any approved products may also be subject to a REMS that render the approved product not commercially viable or other post-market requirements, such as Phase 4 studies, or restrictions. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of any of our product candidates, they may, among other actions, withdraw approval, require labeling changes or establishment of a REMS or similar strategy, impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.\nWe and any of our collaborators, including our contract manufacturer, could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with current GMPs and other FDA regulatory requirements. Application holders must further notify the FDA, and depending on the nature of the change, obtain FDA pre-approval for product and manufacturing changes.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or that the product is less effective than previously thought or other problems with our products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements both before and after approval, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022restrictions on manufacturing, distribution, or marketing of such products;\n\u2022restrictions on the labeling, including restrictions on the indication or approved patient population, and required additional warnings, such as black box warnings, contraindications, and precautions;\n\u2022modifications to promotional pieces;\n\u2022issuance of corrective information;\n\u2022requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or other clinical trials;\n\u2022clinical holds or termination of clinical trials;\n\u2022requirements to establish or modify a REMS or a comparable foreign authority may require that we establish or modify a similar strategy;\n\u2022liability for harm caused to patients or subjects;\n\u2022reputational harm;\n\u2022warning, untitled, Form 483s, or cyber letters;\n\u2022suspension of marketing, withdrawal or recall of the products from the market;\n\u2022regulatory authority issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;\n\u2022refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022fines, restitution, or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022product seizure or detention;\n\u2022FDA debarment, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, consent decrees, or corporate integrity agreements; or\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including imprisonment.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of developing and commercializing such product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale. Any of these events could further have other material and adverse effects on our operations and business and could adversely impact our stock price and could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit, or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates, that could limit the marketability of our product candidates, or that could impose\nadditional regulatory obligations on us. Changes in medical practice and standard of care may also impact the marketability of our product candidates.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely affect our business.\nAny name we intend to use for our product candidates will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d). The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims or contributes to an overstatement of efficacy. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt alternative names for our product candidates. If we adopt alternative names, we would lose the benefit of any existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third-parties, and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe have no prior experience in the marketing, sale, and distribution of pharmaceutical products and there can be no assurance that our products, if approved, will be successfully commercialized.\nWe have no prior experience in the marketing, sale, and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and there are significant risks involved in the building and managing of a commercial infrastructure. The establishment and development of commercial capabilities, including compliance plans, to market any products we may develop will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and we may not be able to successfully develop this capability. We will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train, manage, and retain marketing and sales personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates include:\n\u2022the inability to recruit, train, manage, and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our product candidates;\n\u2022our inability to effectively oversee a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team;\n\u2022the costs associated with training sales and marketing personnel on legal and regulatory compliance matters and monitoring their actions;\n\u2022an inability to secure adequate coverage and reimbursement by government and private health plans;\n\u2022reduced realization on government sales from mandatory discounts, rebates and fees, and from price concessions to private health plans and pharmacy benefit managers necessitated by competition for access to managed formularies;\n\u2022the clinical indications for which the products are approved and the claims that we may make for the products;\n\u2022limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the products\u2019 approved labeling;\n\u2022any distribution and use restrictions imposed by the FDA or to which we agree as part of a mandatory REMS or voluntary risk management plan;\n\u2022liability for sales or marketing personnel who fail to comply with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization or engaging a contract sales organization.\nShould any of the foregoing occur, we may not be successful in commercializing any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval.\nWe face significant competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and other research organizations. Our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe development and commercialization of new vaccines and therapeutic products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization.\nThe competitive landscape of potential COVID-19 vaccines and treatment therapies has been rapidly developing since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with several hundreds of companies claiming to be investigating possible candidates and more than 5,000 studies registered worldwide as investigating COVID-19. We are aware of several competitors developing late-stage COVID-19 vaccines, including Pfizer Inc./BioNTech SE, Moderna, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen Biotech, Inc., and Novavax, Inc. Vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc./BioNTech SE, Moderna, Inc., and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen Biotech have already been granted EUAs by the FDA. We are also aware of others pharmaceutical companies that are working on inactivated virus-based COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, the FDA has authorized and many companies are developing therapeutics to treat COVID-19. If the FDA requires us to conduct clinical trials, enrollment in such trials may be impacted given the commercial availability of other EUA authorized vaccines. Furthermore, the FDA has authorized and many companies are developing therapeutics to treat COVID-19. The success or failure of other vaccines, or perceived success or failure, may adversely impact our ability to obtain any future funding for our joint COVID-19 vaccine development efforts or for us to ultimately commercialize any vaccine candidate, if authorized or approved by the FDA. In addition, we may not be able to compete effectively if our product candidate does not satisfy government procurement requirements with respect to biodefense products. If existing vaccines in the market or if competitors develop and commercialize additional COVID-19 vaccines before we can complete regulatory review and obtain an EUA or regulatory approval for COVAXIN, or if they develop and commercialize one or more COVID-19 vaccines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, have broader market acceptance, are more convenient, or are less expensive than COVAXIN, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe are aware of several companies focusing on gene therapies for various ophthalmic indications, including Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc., Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, MeiraGTx Holdings plc, IVERIC bio, Inc., REGENXBIO Inc., ProQR Therapeutics N.V., Generation Bio Co, Greybug Vision, Inc., and Spark Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by the Roche Group in 2019). Spark Therapeutics, Inc.'s product Luxturna (Spark Therapeutics), which is currently the only gene therapy approved for an IRD in the United States, addresses only one out of at least 150 known mutations of the RPE65 gene. Companies that may compete with our OCU200 product candidate include the Roche Group, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novartis AG, and Kodiak Sciences Inc. The Roche Group, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Novartis AG have marketed anti-VEGF products.\nOur product candidates will target markets that are already served by competing products. Many of these existing products have achieved widespread acceptance among clinicians, patients, and payors.\nOur commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. They may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that allow them to develop and commercialize their products before us and could limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nIn addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors coverage decisions. Our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors, particularly Medicare, seeking to encourage the use of generic or biosimilar products. Many of the products that will compete with our product candidates, if approved, are available on a generic basis, and our product candidates may not demonstrate sufficient additional clinical benefits to clinicians, patients, or payors to justify a higher price compared to generic products. Additional competing products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. In many cases, insurers or other third-party payors, particularly Medicare, seek to encourage the use of generic products.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified\nscientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nIf we are unable to establish effective marketing and sales, capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, if they are approved, we may be unable to generate product revenues.\nWe currently do not have a commercial infrastructure for the marketing, sale, and distribution of biologic and pharmaceutical products. If approved, in order to commercialize our products, we must build our marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If we do not establish sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing any product candidates for which we receive marketing approval.\nSubject to FDA approval of any of our product candidates, we may build a commercial team of specialty sales and marketing representatives in support of our product candidates that we develop in the United States, if and when they are approved, as well as distribution capabilities. There are risks involved with us establishing our own sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities. Recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming, particularly to the extent that we seek to commercialize any product for an indication, such as wet AMD, that has a large patient population. We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations to recruit, hire, train, and retain marketing and sales personnel. Further, we may underestimate the size of the sales force required for a successful product launch and may need to expand our sales force earlier and at a higher cost than we anticipate. If the commercial launch of our product candidates for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nWe may also or alternatively decide to collaborate with a third-party or contract sales organization to commercialize any approved product candidates, in which event, our ability to generate product revenues may be limited. Our product revenues and our profitability, if any, under any third-party collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements are likely to be lower than if we were to market, sell, and distribute the applicable product candidate entirely ourselves. We may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market, and distribute our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, we would have less control over the sales efforts of any other third parties involved in our commercialization efforts and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our product candidates effectively. We could also be held liable if such third parties failed to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements.\nIn the event we are unable to develop a team of marketing and sales representatives or to establish an effective third-party contractual relationship for such services, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates, which would limit our ability to generate product revenues. Even if we are able to effectively hire a sales force and develop a marketing and sales infrastructure, our sales force and marketing teams may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nIf our product candidates do not achieve broad market acceptance, the revenues that we generate from their sales will be limited.\nEven if our product candidates are approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, they may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community. Physicians are often reluctant to switch their patients and patients may be reluctant to switch from existing therapies even when new and potentially more effective or safer treatments enter the market. We have never commercialized a product candidate for any indication, and efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may not be successful. With respect to our product candidates being developed based on our modifier gene therapy platform, market acceptance may also be constrained by ethical, social, and legal concerns about gene therapy and genetic research, which could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the products and processes we may use. The novelty of the technology and any negative publicity surrounding adverse events associated with gene therapy may also prevent the medical community, patients, and third-party payors from accepting gene therapy products in general, and our product candidates in particular, as medically useful, cost-effective, and safe.\nMarket acceptance of our product candidates by the medical community, patients, and third-party payors will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. If any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval does not gain an adequate level of market acceptance, it may not generate significant product revenues or become profitable.\nThe degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the efficacy of our product candidates;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of adverse events associated with such product candidates;\n\u2022the clinical indications for which the products are approved and the approved claims that we may make for the products;\n\u2022limitations or warnings contained in the product\u2019s FDA-approved labeling, including potential limitations or warnings for such product candidates that may be more restrictive than other competitive products;\n\u2022changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for such product candidates, which could reduce the marketing impact of any claims that we could make following FDA approval, if obtained;\n\u2022the relative convenience and ease of administration of such product candidates;\n\u2022cost of treatment versus economic and clinical benefit in relation to alternative treatments or therapies;\n\u2022the availability of third-party formulary coverage and adequate coverage or reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other healthcare payors, and by government healthcare programs, including Medicaid and particularly by Medicare in light of the prevalence of retinal diseases in persons over age 55;\n\u2022the price concessions required by third party payors to obtain coverage;\n\u2022the extent and strength of our manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of such product candidates;\n\u2022distribution and use restrictions imposed by the FDA with respect to such product candidates or to which we agree as part of a REMS or voluntary risk management plan;\n\u2022the extent of availability of generic or biosimilar versions of any products that compete with any of our product candidates and the extent to which they are offered at a substantially lower price than we expect to offer for our product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022adverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products; and\n\u2022potential product liability claims.\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we believe, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.\nThe potential market opportunities for our product candidates are difficult to precisely estimate. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities are predicated on many assumptions, which may include industry knowledge and publications, third-party research reports, and other surveys, some of which we may have commissioned. Industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies generally indicate that their information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. While we believe these industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies are reliable, we have not independently verified such data. In addition, while we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment on the part of our management, are inherently uncertain, and the reasonableness of these assumptions has not been assessed by an independent source. If any of the assumptions proves to be inaccurate, the actual markets for our product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunities, and as a result our product revenue may be limited, and it may be more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf third-party payors do not reimburse patients for our products candidates, if approved, or if reimbursement levels are set too low for us to sell our product candidates at a profit, our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved, and our results of operations will be harmed.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for our product candidates will be available in a timely manner from third-party payors, including governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, and managed care organizations. This is particularly true with respect to OCU200, our novel biologic product candidate, in the case of wet AMD, which is most prevalent in persons over age 55. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement decisions by particular third-party payors depend upon a number of factors, including each third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022appropriate and medically necessary for the specific condition or disease;\n\u2022cost effective; and\n\u2022neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for our product candidates from government authorities or other third-party payors may be a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical, and cost-effectiveness data, including expensive pharmacoeconomic studies beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, for the use of each product candidate to each government authority or other third-party payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement.\nThird-party payors may deny reimbursement for covered products if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost-effective diagnosis methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors also may refuse to reimburse for procedures and devices deemed to be experimental. Third-party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.\nIncreasingly, third-party payors are also requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. These third-party payors could also impose price controls and other conditions that must be met by patients prior to providing coverage for use of our product candidates, if approved. For example, insurers may establish a \u201cstep-edit\u201d system that requires a patient to first use a lower price alternative product prior to becoming eligible for reimbursement of a higher price product.\nThird-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Levels of reimbursement may also decrease in the future, and future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect the demand for and reimbursement available for our product candidates, which in turn, could negatively impact pricing. If patients are not adequately reimbursed for our product candidates, if approved, they may reduce or discontinue purchases of it, which would result in a significant shortfall in achieving revenue expectations and negatively impact our business, prospects and financial condition.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization, we may enter into agreements with third parties to market them on a worldwide basis or in more limited geographical regions. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to conducting marketing and sales activities in international jurisdictions and entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022different regulatory requirements for approval of drugs and biologics in foreign countries\u037e\n\u2022the potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market (with low or lower prices) rather than buying them locally\u037e\n\u2022challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States\u037e\n\u2022the need to seek additional patent approvals, licenses to patents held by third parties, and/or face claims of infringing third-party patent rights;\n\u2022unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, and regulatory requirements\u037e\n\u2022economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets\u037e\n\u2022compliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad\u037e\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country\u037e\n\u2022difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations\u037e\n\u2022workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States\u037e\n\u2022potential liability under the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the \"Bribery Act\") or other comparable foreign regulations\u037e\n\u2022production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad\u037e and\n\u2022business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including pandemics or other outbreaks of infectious disease, earthquakes, typhoons, floods, and fires.\nThese and other risks associated with international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct, supervise, and monitor our preclinical studies and clinical trials we may initiate, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or failing to comply with regulatory requirements.\nWe rely on third parties, study sites, and others to conduct, supervise, and monitor our preclinical trials for our product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical and scientific institutions, and clinical and preclinical investigators, to conduct our ongoing preclinical studies and planned clinical trials.\nWhile we have, or expect to have, agreements governing the activities of such third parties, we will have limited influence and control over their actual performance and activities. Third-party service providers are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our preclinical studies or planned clinical trials. Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and planned clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards and our reliance on third parties will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. We must also ensure that our preclinical trials are conducted in accordance with GLP and under current GMP conditions, as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with GCPs for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. The FDA enforces these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, clinical trial sites, and IRBs.\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our preclinical studies or any planned clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons:\n\u2022we or our CROs or other third-party collaborators may be subject to regulatory enforcement or other legal actions;\n\u2022the data generated in our preclinical studies or planned clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and our such studies and trials may need to be repeated, extended, delayed, or terminated;\n\u2022we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates; or\n\u2022we may not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our preclinical studies or planned clinical trials will comply with the applicable regulatory requirements. To the extent we are unable to successfully identify and manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be materially and adversely affected. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nOur anticipated reliance on third parties in connection with our planned clinical trials will entail additional risks. Our third-party service providers may have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting trials or other therapeutic development activities that could harm our competitive position. In addition, we will be required to report certain financial interests of our third-party investigators if these relationships exceed certain financial thresholds or meet other criteria. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may question the integrity of the data\nfrom those clinical trials conducted by investigators who may have conflicts of interest. Lastly, we are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in enforcement actions and adverse publicity.\nAgreements with third parties conducting or otherwise assisting with our clinical or preclinical studies might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative providers or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional third parties involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new third party commences work. As a result, if we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it could delay our product development activities and adversely affect our business. Though we intend to carefully manage our relationships with third parties, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects, and results of operations.\nWe will also rely on other third parties to store and distribute our product candidates for the preclinical trials that we conduct or for clinical trials we plan to conduct in the future. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay development, marketing approval, or commercialization of our product candidates, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nIf we encounter difficulties in negotiating commercial manufacturing and supply agreements with third-party manufacturers and suppliers of our product candidates or any product components, our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, would be impaired.\nWe do not manufacture any of our product candidates or any product components, and we do not currently plan to develop any capacity to do so. Accordingly, we are, and expect to continue to be, dependent upon third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and any approved products. For example, we do not currently have the capacity to manufacture COVAXIN, and we do not currently plan to develop any capacity to do so. Bharat Biotech has agreed to provide to Ocugen all preclinical and clinical data, and to transfer to us certain proprietary technology owned or controlled by Bharat Biotech, that is necessary for the successful commercial manufacture and supply of COVAXIN to support commercial sale in the United States, if authorized or approved, including pursuant to an EUA. Until the completion of that technology transfer and until we are capable and primarily responsible for the manufacture and supply of COVAXIN in the United States through third parties, Bharat Biotech has the exclusive right to manufacture COVAXIN and we will be wholly dependent on Bharat Biotech for the manufacture and supply of clinical testing materials required for our development activities and all of our requirements of commercial quantities of COVAXIN, if authorized or approved. We and Bharat Biotech intend to enter into supply agreements setting forth the terms of such supply arrangement, but can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully enter into such agreements. Bharat Biotech has agreed to provide a specified minimum number of doses in calendar year 2021, but there can be no assurance that they will in fact provide such number of doses, whether due to shortages in supply, diversion of vaccine resources to other uses deemed more immediate, or other factors. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in transitioning the manufacture of COVAXIN for the U.S. market from Bharat Biotech to a third-party manufacturer. If we are unable to obtain adequate supply of COVAXIN, our U.S. development and commercialization efforts would be impaired.\nAdditionally, we have entered into a strategic partnership with CanSinoBIO to manufacture our gene therapy pipeline product candidates for inherited retinal diseases. Under this agreement, CanSinoBIO will provide all CMC development and clinical supplies for the development of OCU400. The agreement also provides CanSinoBIO an option to support commercial manufacturing for OCU400 and commercialization rights to CanSinoBIO in Greater China. We expect to rely on our qualified suppliers and other third parties to manufacture clinical supplies of other product candidates and commercial supplies of all of our products, if and when approved for marketing by applicable regulatory authorities, as well as for packaging, serialization, storage, distribution, and other production logistics. We, however, may not succeed in our efforts to establish manufacturing relationships or other alternative arrangements for any of our product candidates, components, and programs, or may be unable to do so on commercially favorable terms. If we are unable to enter into such agreements on commercially favorable terms, our future profit margins would be adversely affected and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis would be impaired. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nIf the manufacturers upon whom we rely fail to produce our product candidates or components pursuant to the terms of contractual arrangements with us or fail to comply with stringent regulations applicable to biologic and pharmaceutical manufacturers, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of, or be unable to meet demand for, our product candidates and may lose potential revenues.\nAs with the third parties on which we rely or expect to rely for our preclinical activities and planned clinical trials, we have agreements governing the activities of our manufacturers but have limited influence and control over their actual performance and activities. Our third-party manufacturers are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our manufacturing requirements. If these third-party manufacturers do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or manufacture our product candidates in accordance with regulatory requirements, and if there are disagreements between us and such parties, clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates could be delayed.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of therapeutics often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, and compliance with strictly enforced federal, state, and foreign regulations. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties and were unable to perform as agreed, our ability to provide product candidates to patients in our planned clinical trials and for commercial use, if approved, would be jeopardized.\nIn addition, all manufacturers of our product candidates and therapeutic substances must comply with current GMP requirements enforced by the FDA that are applicable to both finished products and their active components used both for clinical and commercial supply. The FDA enforces these requirements through its facilities inspection program. Our manufacturers must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our marketing applications to the agency. Our manufacturers will also be subject to continuing FDA and other regulatory authority inspections should we receive marketing approval. Further, we, in cooperation with our contract manufacturers, must supply all necessary CMC documentation to the FDA in support of a marketing application on a timely basis.\nThe current GMP requirements include quality control, quality assurance, and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our product candidates and the therapeutic substances and active pharmaceutical ingredients necessary to produce our product candidates may be unable to comply with our specifications, current GMP requirements and with other FDA, state, and foreign regulatory requirements. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of a product candidate that may not be detectable in final product testing. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. Any such deviations may also require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any resulting delays in obtaining products or product candidates that comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in delays to clinical trials, product approvals, and commercialization. It may also require that we conduct additional studies.\nWhile we are ultimately responsible for the manufacture of our product candidates, other than through our contractual arrangements, we have little control over our manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. A failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in regulatory enforcement actions against our manufacturers or us, including fines and civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, suspension or restrictions of production, injunctions, delay, withdrawal or denial of product approval or supplements to approved products, clinical holds or termination of clinical studies, warning or untitled letters, regulatory authority communications warning the public about safety issues with the product, refusal to permit the import or export of the products, product seizure, detention, or recall, operating restrictions, suits under the civil FCA, corporate integrity agreements, or consent decrees. Depending on the severity of any potential regulatory action, our clinical or commercial supply could be interrupted or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny problems or delays we experience in preparing for commercial-scale manufacturing of a product candidate or component, including manufacturing validation, may result in a delay in FDA approval or commercial launch of the product candidate or may impair our ability to manufacture commercial quantities or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could result in the delay, prevention, or impairment of commercialization of our product candidates and could adversely affect our business.\nWe or our third-party manufacturers may also encounter shortages in the materials necessary to produce our product candidates in the quantities needed for our clinical trials or, if our product candidates are approved, in sufficient quantities for commercialization.\nWe or our third-party manufacturers may also encounter shortages in the raw materials, therapeutic substances, or active pharmaceutical ingredients necessary to produce our product candidates in the quantities needed for our clinical trials or, if our product candidates are approved, in sufficient quantities for commercialization or to meet an increase in demand. Such shortages may occur for a variety of reasons, including capacity constraints, delays or disruptions in the market, and shortages caused by the purchase of such materials by our competitors or others. We or our third-party manufacturers\u2019 failure to obtain the raw materials, therapeutic substances, or active pharmaceutical ingredients necessary to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates may cause the manufacturers to fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of our product candidates on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. If such failure occurs, we would likely be unable to meet the demand for our products and we would lose potential revenues.\nThe number of available, qualified third-party manufactures is limited, and if we are compelled to locate an alternative manufacturing partner our product development activities and commercialization could be delayed and additional expense would be incurred.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under current GMP regulations and that are both capable of manufacturing for us and willing to do so, and therefore our product candidates may compete with other products and product candidates for access to manufacturing facilities. Moreover, because our product candidates must be manufactured under sterile conditions, the number of manufacturers who can meet this requirement are even more limited. If our existing third-party manufacturers, or the third parties that we engage in the future to manufacture a product or component for commercial sale or for any clinical trials we expect to initiate in the future should cease to continue to do so for any reason (including the termination of our agreements with such manufacturers, which can occur for a variety of reasons, or the bankruptcy of such manufacturers), it would be difficult to obtain a suitable alternative manufacturer. We would likely experience delays in obtaining sufficient quantities of our product candidates for us to meet commercial demand or to advance our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers. Any change in our manufacturers could be costly because the commercial terms of any new arrangement could be less favorable and because the expenses relating to the transfer of necessary technology and processes could be significant.\nIf the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve the facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if the FDA withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities. Any new manufacturers would need to either obtain or develop the necessary manufacturing know-how, and obtain the necessary equipment and materials, which may take substantial time and investment. We must also receive FDA approval for the use of any new manufacturers for commercial supply. Any such developments would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain, and maintain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nThe number of available third-party facilities may also be further limited by natural disasters, such as pandemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, floods, or fire, or such facilities could face manufacturing issues, such as contamination or regulatory findings following a regulatory inspection of such facility. In such instances, an appropriate replacement third-party relationship may not be readily available to us or on acceptable terms, which would cause additional delay and increased expense and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may seek to collaborate with third parties for the development or commercialization of our product candidates. We may not be successful in establishing or maintaining collaborative relationships, any of which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are currently party to the Covaxin Agreement with Bharat Biotech for the development and commercialization of COVAXIN in the United States and the CanSinoBIO Agreement with CanSinoBIO for the development and commercialization of our initial gene therapy product candidate, OCU400. Our joint development efforts are in the early stages and in the future we may seek to enter into additional collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of other product candidates. We may utilize a variety of types of collaboration, distribution, and other marketing arrangements with third parties to develop and commercialize our product candidates, both inside and outside the United States. In particular, we may enter into arrangements with third parties to perform certain services in the United States if we do not establish our own sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities in the United States or if we determine that such third-party arrangements are otherwise beneficial. We may also consider potential collaborative partnership opportunities for sales, marketing, distribution, development, or licensing or broader collaboration arrangements, including with large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies.\nThe success of our current and future collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to collaboration arrangements. Accordingly, with respect to any such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have\nlimited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend in part on our collaborators\u2019 abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. For example, if Bharat Biotech were to fail to successfully complete the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of COVAXIN, or were to fail to report safety data in accordance with regulatory requirements, our ability to develop COVAXIN in the United States would be impaired.\nMoreover, disagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding clinical development and commercialization matters can lead to delays in the development process or commercializing the applicable product candidate and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision-making authority. Moreover, collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and other third parties are often terminated or allowed to expire. Any such termination or expiration would adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation. In particular, any termination of the Covaxin Agreement would prevent us from developing COVAXIN for the U.S. market.\nOur current and future collaborations may pose a number of additional risks, including the following:\n\u2022collaborators may not pursue development of product candidates and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u2022collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022collaborators could fail to make timely regulatory submissions for a product candidate;\n\u2022collaborators may not comply with all applicable regulatory requirements or may fail to report safety data in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could subject them or us to regulatory enforcement actions;\n\u2022collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product candidate or product;\n\u2022disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation, or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time consuming and expensive;\n\u2022collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties or fail to maintain intellectual property rights which they license to us, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u2022collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. If any collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of product candidates or if one of our collaborators subsequently terminates our agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration, as applicable. If we do not receive the funding we expect under the agreements, our development of our product candidates could be delayed, and we may need additional resources to develop our\nproduct candidates and our product platform. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval, and commercialization described in this report also apply to the activities of our collaborators.\nAdditionally, if any collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination, the collaborator might de-emphasize or terminate development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us. If one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our reputation in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected.\nShould we desire to pursue a collaboration agreement but are not able to establish collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans and our business could be adversely affected.\nFor some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. Should we desire to pursue a collaboration agreement but are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay our development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay our potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product platform and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Legal and Compliance Matters\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health and other information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nAs a biologic and pharmaceutical company, we are subject to many federal and state healthcare laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil and criminal FCA, the civil monetary penalties statute, the Medicaid Drug Rebate statute and other price reporting requirements, the VHCA, the HIPAA, the FCPA, the ACA, and similar state laws. We may also be subject to laws regarding transparency and patient privacy. Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws, and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, reimbursement programs, government procurement, and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business.\nIt is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any federal or state healthcare law, or any other governmental laws or regulations that applies to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, corporate integrity agreements, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although an effective compliance program can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, reimbursement, and fraud laws may prove costly. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defends against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nWe are subject to new legislation, regulatory proposals, and healthcare payor initiatives that may increase our costs of compliance, and adversely affect our ability to market our products, obtain collaborators, and raise capital.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any products for which we obtain marketing approval. The biopharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by legislative initiatives. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved products.\nIn 2010, the ACA, included provisions of importance to our business, including, without limitation, our ability to commercialize and the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates that are approved for sale. These provisions include:\n\u2022an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, including products approved through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway;\n\u2022an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a sponsor must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u2022a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which participating sponsors must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated drug prices of drugs and biologics approved under an NDA or BLA (including drugs approved pursuant to the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway) during the coverage gap period as a condition for the sponsors\u2019 outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal FCA and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and the addition of new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022extension of sponsor\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability to managed Medicaid plans;\n\u2022expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u2022expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the PHSA pharmaceutical pricing program; and\n\u2022creation of a special Medicare Part B payment methodology for biosimilars approved under PHSA Section 351(k) in which providers are paid the ASP of the biosimilar plus the margin based on ASP of the reference biologic.\nThe ACA was recently amended to repeal the individual insurance mandate, and efforts to repeal and replace portions of the law continue. It remains to be seen, however, whether new legislation will be enacted and, if so, precisely what any new legislation could provide and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, it is possible that any repeal and replacement initiatives, if enacted into law, could ultimately result in fewer individuals having health insurance coverage or in individuals having insurance coverage with less generous benefits. Accordingly, such reforms, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop or commercialize product candidates. The timing and scope of any potential future legislation to repeal and replace ACA provisions is highly uncertain in many respects.\nSince the ACA was enacted in 2010, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted. These changes include, among other things, aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went effective in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. More recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act increased sponsor responsibility for prescription costs in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, and also extended sponsor responsibility for prescription costs in the Medicare Part D coverage gap to biosimilars, which had previously been exempt. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. CMS promulgated regulations governing sponsors\u2019 obligations and reimbursement under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and recently promulgated a regulation that limited Medicare Part B payment to certain hospitals for outpatient drugs purchased under the 340B program. To the extent that we license the right to sell a product to another entity under that entity\u2019s labeler code, the licensee would further have healthcare reimbursement and pricing regulatory responsibilities.\nWe expect that current law and federal and state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, increased regulatory burdens and operating costs, decreased net revenue from our biologic and pharmaceutical products, decreased potential returns from our development efforts, new payment methodologies, and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product we might bring to market. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices we receive or the frequency with which any\nproducts we may develop are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\nThe pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and biologics is also subject to governmental control outside the United States. In certain countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our ability to generate revenues and become profitable could be impaired.\nIn addition, there have been a number of other legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the biologic and pharmaceutical industry. For instance, the Drug Quality and Security Act (the \u201cDQSA\u201d), imposes obligations on sponsors of biologic and pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, sponsors are required to provide certain information regarding the product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, will be required to label products with a product identifier, and are required keep certain records regarding the product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers is also required to be done electronically. Sponsors are also required to verify that purchasers of the sponsors\u2019 products are appropriately licensed. Further, manufacturers have product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences of death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Future licensees or affiliates may also have responsibilities under DQSA.\nCompliance with the federal track and trace requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens. As a result of these and other new proposals, we may determine to change our current manner of operation, provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, principal investigators, or CROs may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, manufacturers, investigators, or CROs could include intentional, reckless, negligent, or unintentional failures to (i) comply with FDA regulations, or other similar regulatory requirements, (ii) comply with manufacturing standards, including current GMP requirements, (iii) comply with applicable fraud and abuse laws, (iv) comply with federal and state data privacy, security, fraud and abuse, and other healthcare laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, (v) provide accurate information to the FDA, (vi) properly calculate pricing information required by federal programs, (vii) comply with federal procurement rules or contract terms, (viii) report financial information or data accurately or (ix) disclose unauthorized activities to us. This misconduct could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation.\nIt is not always possible to identify and deter this type of misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting it from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.\nIf any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgements, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws, and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other\nremedial measures and legal expenses, be precluded from developing manufacturing and selling certain products outside the United States, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business and may do business in the future. The Bribery Act, FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us, our officers, and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed, or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage.\nCompliance with the FCPA, in particular, is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. The FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.\nWe may in the future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and we may participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA, or local anti-corruption laws. We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements, and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. In addition, various laws, regulations, and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nIf we are not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions. Any investigation of any potential violations of the Bribery Act, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by U.K., United States, or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may be unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and product candidates, or the scope of the patent protection obtained may not be sufficiently broad or enforceable, such that our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and product candidates may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and product candidates. We have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions patent applications related to our novel technologies and product candidates.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not have filed, maintained, or prosecuted and may not be able to file, maintain, and prosecute all necessary or desirable patents or patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may\nfail to result in issued patents in the United States or in other foreign countries which protect our technology or product candidates, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and the standards applied by the USPTO and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, unlike patent law in the United States, European patent law precludes the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body and imposes substantial restrictions on the scope of claims it will grant of broader than specifically disclosed embodiments. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Databases for patents and publications, and methods for searching them, are inherently limited so we may not know the full scope of all issued and pending patent applications. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patent rights are uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. In particular, during prosecution of any patent application, the issuance of any patents based on the application may depend upon our ability to generate additional preclinical or clinical data that support the patentability of our proposed claims. We may not be able to generate sufficient additional data on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection for our proprietary technology and product candidates, prevent competitors from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. In some instances, we may need to license additional patents and trade secrets to commercialize our product candidates in certain territories.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to our inventorship, ownership, scope, validity, or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and product candidates. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nIn 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \"Leahy-Smith Act\") was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective in 2013. The first to file provisions limit the rights of an inventor to patent an invention if not the first to file an application for patenting that invention, even if such invention was the first invention. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. For example, the Leahy-Smith Act created a new administrative tribunal known as the Patent Trial and Appeals Board (\"PTAB\"), that provides a venue for companies to challenge the validity of competitor patents at a cost that is much lower than district court litigation and on timelines that are much faster. Although it is not clear what, if any, long term impact the PTAB proceedings will have on the operation of our business, the outcome of patent challenge proceedings before the PTAB since its inception in 2013 have resulted in the invalidation of many U.S. patent claims. The availability of the PTAB as a lower-cost, faster and potentially more potent tribunal for challenging patents could therefore increase the likelihood that our own patents will be challenged, thereby increasing the uncertainties and costs of maintaining, defending, and enforcing them.\nIf we are not able to obtain patent term extension in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of our marketing exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one of the U.S. patents covering each of such product candidates or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA approved product to account for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates. Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product may be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration sooner, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nIt is possible that we will not obtain patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act for a U.S. patent covering one of our product candidates even where that patent is eligible for patent term extension, or if we obtain such an extension, it may be for a shorter period than we had sought. Further, for our licensed patents, we do not have the right to control prosecution, including filing with the USPTO, a petition for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Thus, if one of our licensed patents is eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, we may not be able to control whether a petition to obtain a patent term extension is filed, or obtained, from the USPTO.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors and other third parties may infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate our owned and licensed patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property. As a result, to counter infringement, misappropriation, or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement or misappropriation claims or other intellectual property related proceedings, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke such parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringed their patents or that our asserted patents are invalid. In addition, in a patent infringement or other intellectual property related proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly, and could put any of our patent applications at risk of not yielding an issued patent. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information or trade secrets could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nWe may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in other contested proceedings such as opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review, or interference proceedings in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop, or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nIn the United States, the FDA does not prohibit clinicians from prescribing an approved product for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling. Although use of a product directed by off-label prescriptions may infringe our method-of-treatment patents, the practice is common across medical specialties, particularly in the United States, and such infringement is difficult to detect, prevent, or prosecute.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market, and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is a considerable amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, infringement litigation claims regarding our products and technology, including claims from competitors or from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect. Moreover, we may become party to future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding our patent portfolio or the patents of third parties. Such proceedings could also include contested post-grant proceedings such as oppositions, inter partes review, reexamination, interference, or derivation proceedings before the USPTO or foreign patent offices.\nThe legal threshold for initiating litigation or contested proceedings is low, so even lawsuits or proceedings with a low probability of success might be initiated and require significant resources to defend. Litigation and contested proceedings can also be expensive and time-consuming, and our adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we do. The risks of being involved in such litigation and proceedings may increase as our product candidates near commercialization and as we gain the greater visibility associated with being a public company. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. We may not be aware of all such intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates and their uses.\nThus, we do not know with certainty that any of our product candidates, or our development and commercialization thereof, do not and will not infringe or otherwise violate any third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIf we are found to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing its products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us and could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent, and could be forced to indemnify our customers or collaborators. A finding of infringement could also result in an injunction that prevents us from commercializing our product candidates or forces us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. In addition, we may be forced to redesign our product candidates, seek new regulatory approvals and indemnify third parties pursuant to contractual agreements. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance, renewal, and annuity fees on any issued patent must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages or annually over the lifetime of our owned and licensed patents and patent applications. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In certain circumstances, we rely on our licensing partners to pay these fees to, or comply with the procedural and documentary rules of the relevant patent agency. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCertain aspects of our product candidates are protected by patents exclusively licensed from other companies or institutions. If these third parties terminate their agreements with us or fail to maintain or enforce the underlying patents or licenses thereto, or we otherwise lose our rights to these patents, our competitive position and our market share in the markets for any of our approved products will be harmed.\nA substantial portion of our patent portfolio is in-licensed. As such, we are party to license agreements and certain aspects of our business depend on patents and/or patent applications owned by other companies or institutions. In particular, we hold\nexclusive licenses for patent families relating to OCU400, OCU410, and OCU200 and an exclusive license in the United States with respect to patents relating to COVAXIN.\nPursuant to the CU Agreement, which primarily relates to OCU200, we are responsible for and control patent prosecution of all patent families licensed under the CU Agreement.\nPursuant to the SERI Agreement, which relates to NHR genes NR1D1, NR2E3, RORA, NUPR1, and NR2C1, from and after December 19, 2017, we have the right to assume responsibility and control patent prosecution of licensed patent families relating to these NHR genes. Additionally, we are responsible for and control patent prosecution for any patent applications developed in connection with the SERI Agreement filed after December 19, 2017 that are owned jointly by us and SERI or solely by us.\nOur rights with respect to in-licensed patents and patent applications may be lost if the applicable license agreement expires or is terminated. We are likely to enter into additional license agreements to in-license patents and patent applications as part of the development of our business in the future, under which we may not retain control of the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, enforcement, and defense of such patents. If we are unable to maintain these patent rights for any reason, our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates could be materially harmed.\nOur licensors may not successfully prosecute certain patent applications, the prosecution of which they control, under which we are licensed and on which our business depends. Even if patents issue from these applications, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may decide not to pursue litigation against third-party infringers, may fail to prove infringement, or may fail to defend against counterclaims of patent invalidity or unenforceability. In some cases, our licensors may in-license certain patents licensed to us. If our licensors were to fail to maintain such licenses, we may need to obtain additional licenses with respect to the applicable product candidates.\nRisks with respect to parties from whom we have obtained intellectual property rights may also arise out of circumstances beyond our control. In spite of our best efforts, our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our intellectual property agreements and might therefore terminate the intellectual property agreements, thereby removing our ability to market products covered by these intellectual property agreements. If our intellectual property agreements are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended market exclusivity, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products similar or identical to ours. Moreover, if our intellectual property agreements are terminated, our former licensors and/or assignors may be able to prevent us from utilizing the technology covered by the licensed or assigned patents and patent applications. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive business position and our business prospects.\nSome intellectual property which we own or have licensed may have been discovered through government funded programs and thus may be subject to federal regulations such as \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights, certain reporting requirements, and a preference for U.S. industry. Compliance with such regulations may limit our exclusive rights, subject us to expenditure of resources with respect to reporting requirements, and limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. manufacturers.\nSome of the intellectual property rights that we own or licenses have been generated through the use of U.S. government funding and may therefore be subject to certain federal regulations under the Bayh-Dole Act. To the best of our knowledge, our intellectual property for OCU400 for the treatment of NR2E3 mutation-associated retinal degenerative disease and other retinal degenerative diseases is subject to the Bayh-Dole Act. As a result, the U.S. government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in these patents and patent applications. In general, the Bayh-Dole Act provides the U.S. government certain rights in inventions developed using a government funded program, such as U.S. government\u2019s right to a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, under the Bayh-Dole Act the U.S. government has the right to require any invention developed using U.S. government funding to be granted exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations (also referred to as \u201cmarch-in rights\u201d). Under the Bayh-Dole Act, the U.S. government also has the right to take title to inventions developed using a U.S. government funded program, if one fails to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. In addition, the U.S. government may acquire title to these inventions in any country in which a patent application is not filed within specified time limits. Intellectual property generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements. In addition, the Bayh-Dole Act requires that any products subject to the Bayh-Dole Act be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, under the Bayh-Dole Act, this manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the intellectual property can show that reasonable efforts to manufacture the product substantially in the United States were unsuccessful or that under the\ncircumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. Any exercise by the government of any of the foregoing rights under the Bayh-Dole Act may affect our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nOur agreements under which we license certain of our patent rights and a significant portion of the technology for our product candidates, impose royalty and other financial obligations on us and other substantial performance obligations. We may also enter into additional licensing and funding arrangements with third parties that may impose diligence, development, and commercialization timelines and milestone payment, royalty, insurance, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under current or future license and collaboration agreements, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop, manufacture, or market any product that is covered by these agreements or may face other penalties under the agreements. Such an occurrence could diminish the value of our products and product candidates. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in us having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology.\nIn addition, it is possible that our licensors may conclude that we have materially breached the applicable license agreement and might therefore terminate the agreement, thereby removing our ability to market products covered by such agreements. If any license is terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended market exclusivity, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products similar or identical to ours. Moreover, if any of our license agreements are terminated, the counterparty and/or its assignors may be able to prevent us from utilizing the technology covered by the licensed or assigned patents and patent applications. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive business position and our business prospects.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection or licenses, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nMany countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our and our licensors\u2019 employees and contractors were previously employed at other biotechnology, medical device, or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Furthermore, we are unable to control whether our licensors have obtained similar assignment agreements from their own employees and contractors. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we or our licensors may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we or our licensors fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive business position and prospects. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and may also have an advantage in such proceedings due to their more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors, and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of a trade secret and enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it,\nfrom using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation, if any, in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation, and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock. There is no guarantee that the common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.\nSales of a substantial number of common stock by our stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline. We had 184.0 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020, which were all freely tradable, without restriction, in the public market as of December 31, 2020.\nIf a substantial number of shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline, we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nWe have used almost all of our unreserved, authorized shares.\nWe have used almost all of our unreserved authorized shares and will need stockholder approval to implement an increase in our authorized shares of common stock or a reverse stock split. Our sixth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), currently require the approval of stockholders holding not less than a majority of all outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote in order to approve an increase in our authorized shares of common stock or a reverse stock split. There are no assurances that stockholder approval will be obtained, in which event we will be unable to raise additional capital through the issuance of shares of common stock to fund our future operations.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could significantly reduce the value of our shares to a potential acquiror or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our Board of Directors. The provisions in our charter documents include the following:\n\u2022a classified Board of Directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors;\n\u2022no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022the exclusive right of our Board of Directors, unless the Board of Directors grants such right to the stockholders, to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u2022the prohibition on removal of directors without cause due to the classified Board of Directors;\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to alter our amended and restated bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u2022the required approval of at least 66-2/3% of the shares entitled to vote to adopt, amend, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws or repeal certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022an exclusive forum provision providing that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings;\n\u2022the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer or the Board of Directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the DGCL. Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nOur sixth amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur sixth amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. By agreeing to this provision, however, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find the choice of forum provisions in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe trading price of the shares of the our Common Stock could be highly volatile, and purchasers of the Common Stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been, and will likely continue to be volatile. During the 60 trading days immediately prior to the date of this report, the closing price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $0.29 to a high of $15.81. The stock market in general and the market for stock of biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above their purchase price. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by those factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and many others, including:\n\u2022our ability to enroll subjects in our ongoing and planned clinical trials;\n\u2022results of our clinical trials and preclinical studies, and the results of trials of our competitors or those of other companies in our market sector;\n\u2022regulatory approval of our product candidates, or limitations to specific label indications or patient populations for our use, or changes or delays in the regulatory review process;\n\u2022the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022reports of adverse events in other of our products, competing biologics, or gene therapy products;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems, especially in light of current reforms to the U.S. healthcare system;\n\u2022the success or failure of our efforts to acquire, license, or develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022innovations or new products developed by us or our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022manufacturing, supply, or distribution delays or shortages;\n\u2022any changes to our relationship with any manufacturers, suppliers, licensors, future collaborators, or other strategic partners;\n\u2022achievement of expected product sales and profitability;\n\u2022variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to ours;\n\u2022market conditions in the biopharmaceutical sector and issuance of securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022an inability to obtain additional funding;\n\u2022sales of our stock by insiders and stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur;\n\u2022our ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel, including major changes in our board or management;\n\u2022intellectual property, product liability, or other litigation against us; and\n\u2022general economic, industry, market conditions, and other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against biopharmaceutical companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the research and development, clinical, and business development expertise of Shankar Musunuri, Ph.D., MBA, our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Co-Founder, as well as the other principal members of our management, scientific, and clinical teams. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing, legal, and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development, and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of, and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is\nintense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain, or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy, including with respect to our development of COVAXIN for the U.S. market. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nWe expect to expand our development, regulatory, and manufacturing capabilities and potentially implement sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, clinical, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, sales, marketing, and distribution. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational, and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Our management may need to devote a significant amount of our attention to managing these growth activities. Due to our limited financial resources and our limited experience in managing such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Our inability to manage the expansion of our operations effectively may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could also require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If we are unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy, including the successful commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Sarbanes-Oxley\"), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform, and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. We have had to hire additional accounting, finance, and other personnel in connection with our efforts to comply with the requirements of being a public company and our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these requirements. These requirements increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nIn addition, Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and Nasdaq to implement provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC has adopted additional rules and regulations in these areas, such as mandatory \u201csay on pay\u201d voting requirements that are applicable to us. Stockholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nIf these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The increased costs could impact our results of operations, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our board committees, or as executive officers.\nIf we or any contract manufacturers and suppliers we engage fail to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe and any contract manufacturers and suppliers we engage are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, and permitting requirements, including those governing laboratory procedures; the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and regulated materials and wastes; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, and water; and employee health and safety. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our current or past facilities and at third-party facilities. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nCompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research and product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. Although we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not carry specific biological agents coverage, and our commercial general liability policy specifically excludes coverage for damages and fines arising from biological agents. Accordingly, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, and permitting requirements. These current or future laws, regulations, and permitting requirements may impair our research, development, or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permitting requirements also may result in substantial fines, penalties, or other sanctions or business disruption, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nAny third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers we engage will also be subject to these and other environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Liabilities they incur pursuant to these laws and regulations could result in significant costs or an interruption in operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nPursuant to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, our management is required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, if we reach an accelerated filer threshold, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation. To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we will need to upgrade our information technology systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance personnel. If we or, if required, our auditors are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or, if applicable, if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for our product candidates and may have to limit our commercialization.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials, and the sale of any of our product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval, exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. For example, we may be sued if any product candidate we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing, or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourself against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit development or commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022loss of revenue from decreased demand for our products and/or product candidates;\n\u2022impairment of our business reputation or financial stability;\n\u2022costs of related litigation;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u2022diversion of management attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants and potential termination of clinical trial sites or entire clinical programs;\n\u2022the inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022significant negative media attention;\n\u2022decrease in our stock price;\n\u2022initiation of investigations, and enforcement actions by regulators; or\n\u2022product recalls, withdrawals, revocation of approvals, or labeling, marketing, or promotional restrictions.\nWhile we currently hold product liability insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is customary for similarly situated companies, the amount of that coverage may not be adequate. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we begin our clinical trials. We will need to further increase our insurance coverage if we commence commercialization of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on therapeutics that had unanticipated side effects. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business and our prospects.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures, and we face risks related to our collection and use of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product candidate development and, if such product candidates are approved, commercialization programs.\nAdditionally, our business processes personal data, including some data related to health. When conducting clinical trials, we face risks associated with collecting trial participants\u2019 data, especially health data, in a manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations. We also face risks inherent in handling large volumes of data and in protecting the security of such data. We could be subject to attacks on our systems by outside parties or fraudulent or inappropriate behavior by our service providers or employees. Third parties may also gain access to our systems using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks, or other means, and may use such access to obtain personal data. Data breaches could subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory entities in the United States and by international regulatory entities, resulting in exposure to material civil and/or\ncriminal liability. As our operations and business grow, we may become subject to or affected by new or additional data protection laws and regulations and face increased scrutiny or attention from regulatory authorities, including various domestic and international privacy and security regulations. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. In the United States, certain states may adopt privacy and security laws and regulations that may be more stringent than applicable federal law. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. We may also in the future be subject to data protection laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which provides data subjects with certain rights and requires organizations to adopt technical and organizational safeguards to protect personal data. In the event that we are subject to or affected by privacy and data protection laws, including the CCPA or GDPR and other domestic or international privacy and data protection laws, we may expend significant resources to comply with such laws, and any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition.", "PERMNO": 15132, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "OCGN"}
