{"cik": "1396033", "company": "Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply generally to companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nUnfavorable allegations, government investigations and legal actions surrounding our products or us could harm our reputation and impair our ability to grow or sustain our business.\nWe have been involved in a number of government investigations and legal actions, many of which have resulted from unfavorable allegations regarding our products and us. Negative publicity surrounding these government investigations and legal actions could continue to harm our reputation and the demand for our products. Additional unfavorable allegations, government investigations and legal actions involving our products and us could also affect our perception in the market and our brands and negatively impact our business and financial condition. For instance, unfavorable allegations surrounding the product quality of our laminates sourced from China has negatively affected and could continue to negatively affect our operations. If this negative impact is significant, our ability to maintain our liquidity and grow or sustain our business could be jeopardized. The cost to defend ourselves and our former employees could be significant.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings and, while we cannot predict the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of the outcomes of these proceedings could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are, or may become, involved in legal proceedings, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation (see discussion of Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of this Annual Report). While we have accrued material liabilities in connection with certain of these proceedings, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcomes. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings could require us to take actions which could be costly to implement or otherwise negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and could affect our ability to obtain capital or access our revolving loan and continue as a going concern. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and legal proceedings involves significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur overall compliance program, including the Lacey Compliance Plan, is complex and costly to maintain. A failure to manage these programs could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, result in significant fines and other penalties, damage our brand and reputation, and, consequently, negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nAs disclosed on October 7, 2015, we reached a settlement with the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) regarding our compliance with the Lacey Act. In connection with that settlement, we agreed to implement the Lacey Compliance Plan, and we are subject to a probation period of five years. Our implementation of the Lacey Compliance Plan, together with requirements resulting from other settlement agreements we have entered into over the past few years (including the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the \u201cDPA\u201d) with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia (the \u201cU.S. Attorney\u201d) and the DOJ entered into on March 12, 2019), is costly and, if the implementation costs are more than we anticipate, could adversely affect our operating results. In the event we fail to fully implement and comply with the Lacey Compliance Plan as required and in accordance with set deadlines, the government may require us to cease the importation of hardwood flooring from China until the DOJ determines that we are in full compliance with the Lacey Compliance Plan. If we have to cease the importation of hardwood flooring, our ability to operate would be substantially harmed and our business, including our results of operations, would be adversely affected. In the event we breach the DPA, there is a risk the U.S. Attorney and the DOJ would seek to impose remedies provided for in the DPA, including criminal prosecution. Further, the failure to properly manage our overall compliance program and fully comply with the obligations imposed upon us by these various settlement agreements or implement any of the compliance requirements arising from these obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, result in significant fines and other penalties, damage our brand and reputation and negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nFederal, provincial, state or local laws and regulations, including tariffs, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, and our obligations under certain settlement agreements related to our products could increase our expenses, restrict our ability to conduct our business and expose us to legal risks.\nWe are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations imposed by federal, provincial, state and local authorities in the countries in which we operate, including those related to tariffs, customs, foreign operations (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, privacy, zoning and occupancy matters as well as the operation of retail stores and warehouse, production and distribution facilities and provision of installation services. In addition, various federal, provincial and state laws govern our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, including wage and hour-related laws. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to legal risk, our operations could be impacted negatively and our reputation could be damaged. Likewise, if such laws and regulations should change, our costs of compliance may increase, thereby impacting our results and hurting our profitability.\nCertain portions of our operations are subject to laws and regulations governing hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater and the health and safety of employees. If we are unable to comply with, extend or renew a material approval, license or permit required by such laws, or if there is a delay in renewing any material approval, license or permit, our net sales and operating results could deteriorate or otherwise cause harm to our business.\nWith regard to our products, we spend significant resources in order to comply with applicable advertising, importation, exportation, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. If we should violate these laws and regulations, we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines, penalties, criminal charges, or other legal risks, be liable for costs and damages, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and hurt our business and results of operations. Further, if such laws and regulations should change we may experience increased costs in order to adhere to the new standards. We are also subject to a number of settlement agreements that impose certain obligations on us with respect to the operation of our business. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we may experience additional costs and expenses and could be subject to additional legal risks.\nOur growth strategy depends in part on our ability to open new stores and is subject to many unpredictable factors.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had 413 stores throughout the United States and Canada. Assuming the continued success of our store model and satisfaction of our internal criteria, we plan to continue our selective approach to future openings over the next several years. This growth strategy and the investment associated with the development of each new store may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or decrease our profits. Our future results and ability to implement our growth strategy will depend on various factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nas we open more stores, our rate of expansion relative to the size of our store base will decline;\n\u00b7\nconsumers in new markets may be less familiar with our brands, and we may need to increase brand awareness in those markets through additional investments in advertising;\n\u00b7\nnew stores may have higher construction, occupancy or operating costs, inventory requirements, or may have lower average store net sales, than stores opened in the past;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive pressures could cause changes to our store model and making necessary changes could prove costly;\n\u00b7\nnewly opened stores may reach profitability more slowly than we expect in the future, as we enter more mid-sized and smaller markets and add stores to larger markets where we already have a presence; and\n\u00b7\nour Canadian stores may require additional investment in advertising due to our limited penetration in the Canadian market.\nFailure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\nOur plans call for our selective approach in the addition of new stores over the next several years, and increased orders from our website, call center and catalogs. Our existing management information systems, including our store management systems, compliance procedures and financial and reporting controls, may be unable to support our expansion. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to hire, train and retain regional and store managers and personnel for our compliance and financial and reporting departments. We may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on us. Any failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\nIncreased transportation costs could harm our results of operations.\nThe efficient transportation of our products through our supply chain is a critical component of our operations. If the cost of fuel or other costs, such as import tariffs, duties and international container rates, rise, it could result in increases in our cost of sales due to additional transportation charges and fees. Additionally, there are a limited number of delivery companies capable of efficiently transporting our products from our suppliers. Consolidation within this industry could result in increased transportation costs. A reduction in the availability of qualified drivers and an increase in driver regulations could continue to increase our costs. We may be unable to increase the price of our products to offset increased transportation charges, which could cause our operating results to deteriorate.\nDamage, destruction or disruption of our distribution centers could significantly impact our operations and impede our ability to distribute certain of our products.\nWe have two distribution centers which house products for the direct shipment of flooring to our stores or to our customers. If either of our distribution centers or our inventory held in those locations were damaged or destroyed by fire, wood infestation or other causes, our distribution processes would be disrupted, which could cause significant\ndelays in delivery. This could impede our ability to stock our stores and deliver products to our customers, and cause our net sales and operating results to deteriorate.\nThe operation of stores in Canada and our representative office in China may present increased legal and operational risks.\nWe currently operate eight store locations in Canada. As a result of our limited penetration in the Canadian market, these stores may continue to be less successful than we expect. Additionally, investments in advertising and promotional activity may be required to continue to build brand awareness in that market.\nWe also have a representative office in Shanghai, China to facilitate our product sourcing in Asia. We have limited experience with the legal and regulatory environments and market practices outside of the United States and cannot guarantee that we will be able to operate profitably in these markets or in a manner and with results similar to those in the United States. We may also incur increased costs in complying with applicable Canadian and Chinese laws and regulations as they pertain to both our products and our operations. Further, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to, among other things, litigation and government and agency investigations.\nFailure to effectively manage our third-party installers may present increased legal and operational risks.\nWe manage third-party installers who provide installation services to some of our customers. In some of these jurisdictions, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of our third-party installers. We have established procedures designed to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. If we fail to manage these procedures effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we may be subject to regulatory enforcement and litigation and our net sales and our profitability and reputation could be harmed.\nOur founder is the lessor on a significant number of our leases and the satisfactory renewal of these as each comes due is a risk to our occupancy costs and store count.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we leased our Toano facility, which includes a store location, a warehouse and 29 of our other store locations from entities owned, in whole or in part, by Tom Sullivan, our founder. Although our percentage of total stores leased from such entities has decreased and our lease at the Toano facility ends on December 31, 2019, this concentration of leases subjects us to the risk of increased costs or reduction of store count in the event of an adverse action or inaction by Mr. Sullivan or such entities. Mr. Sullivan no longer serves as an employee or as a director of the Company.\nOur success depends upon the retention of our personnel.\nWe believe that our success has depended and continues to depend on the efforts and capabilities of our employees. The loss of the services of key employees due to any negative market or industry perception, the Company\u2019s stock price, the Company\u2019s headquarters move, and/or litigation may prevent us from achieving operational goals and harm our reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Suppliers, Products and Product Sourcing\nOur ability and cost to obtain cost-effective products, especially from China and other international suppliers, and the operations of many of our international suppliers are subject to risks that may be beyond our control and that could harm our operations and profitability.\nWe rely on a select group of international suppliers to provide us with imported flooring products that meet our specifications. In 2018, our imported product was sourced from Asia, Europe, Australia and South America. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with obtaining products from abroad, including:\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of duties (including antidumping and countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes and/or other charges on exports or imports;\n\u00b7\npolitical unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries where our products originate;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters and climate change issues, labor conditions, quality and safety standards, trade restrictions, and restrictions on funds transfers;\n\u00b7\ndisruptions or delays in production, shipments, delivery or processing through ports of entry; and\n\u00b7\ndifferences in product standards, acceptable business practices and legal environments of the country of origin.\nIn 2018, we sourced approximately 47% of our products from China. Virtually all of these products had a 10% tariff imposed upon them in late 2018 and many of these products could increase further should the tariff rate increase as has been announced but postponed indefinitely, go into effect. Potential costs and any attendant impact on pricing arising from these tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThese and other factors beyond our control could disrupt the ability of our suppliers to ship certain products to us cost-effectively or at all, which could harm our operations. If our product costs and consumer demand are adversely affected by foreign trade issues (including import tariffs and other trade restrictions with China), our sales and profitability may suffer.\nFailure to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers could affect our ability to obtain products that meet our high quality standards.\nWe purchase flooring directly from mills located around the world. We believe that these direct supplier relationships are important to our business. In order to retain the competitive advantage that we believe results from these relationships, we need to continue to identify, develop and maintain relationships with qualified suppliers that can satisfy our high standards for quality and our requirements for the delivery of hardwood in a timely and efficient manner. We expect the need to develop new relationships to be particularly important as we seek to expand our operations, enhance our product offerings, and expand our product assortment and geographic source of origin in the future. Any inability to do so could reduce our competitiveness, slow our plans for further expansion and cause our net sales and operating results to deteriorate.\nWe rely on a concentrated number of suppliers for a significant portion of our supply needs. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers. In the future, our suppliers may be unable to supply us, or supply us on acceptable terms, due to various factors, which could include political instability in the supplier\u2019s country, insufficient production capacity, product line failures, collusion, a supplier\u2019s financial instability, inability or refusal to comply with\napplicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs or our standards, duties, insufficient transport capacity and other factors beyond our control. In these circumstances, we could experience deterioration in our net sales and operating results.\nThe failure of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, use ethical practices, and meet our quality standards could result in our suspending purchasing from them, negatively impacting net sales, and could expose us to reputational and legal risks.\nWhile our suppliers agree to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we do not control our suppliers. Accordingly, despite our continued investment in quality control, we cannot guarantee that they comply with such laws and regulations or operate in a legal, ethical and responsible manner. While we monitor our suppliers\u2019 adherence to our quality standards, there is no guarantee that we will be able to identify non-compliance. Moreover, the failure of our suppliers to adhere to applicable legal requirements and the quality standards that we set for our products could lead to government investigations, litigation, write-offs and recalls, which could damage our reputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise hurt our business.\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our reputation, which could adversely affect our net sales and profitability.\nWe have faced and continue to face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in economic loss, personal injury or property damage or violated environmental or other laws. In the event that any of our products proves to be defective or otherwise in violation of applicable laws, we may be required to recall or redesign such products. Further, in such instances, we may be subject to legal action. We maintain insurance against some forms of product liability claims, but such coverage may not be available or adequate for the liabilities actually incurred. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, or any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity against us, may have a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating results.\nOur ability to offer hardwood flooring, particularly products made of more exotic species of hardwood, depends on the continued availability of sufficient suitable hardwood at reasonable cost.\nOur business strategy depends on offering a wide assortment of hardwood flooring to our customers. We sell flooring made from species ranging from domestic maple, oak and pine to imported cherry, koa, mahogany and teak. Some of these species are scarce, and we cannot be assured of their continued availability. Our ability to obtain an adequate volume and quality of hard-to-find species depends on our suppliers\u2019 ability to furnish those species, which, in turn, could be affected by many things including events such as forest fires, insect infestation, tree diseases, prolonged drought and other adverse weather and climate conditions. Government regulations relating to forest management practices also affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to harvest or export timber, and changes to regulations and forest management policies, or the implementation of new laws or regulations, could impede their ability to do so. If our suppliers cannot deliver sufficient hardwood and we cannot find replacement suppliers, our net sales and operating results may be negatively impacted.\nThe cost of the various species of hardwood that are used in our products is important to our profitability. Hardwood lumber costs fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, product availability, environmental restrictions, government regulation and trade policies, duties, weather conditions, processing and freight costs, and delivery delays and disruptions. We generally do not have long-term supply contracts or guaranteed purchase amounts. As a result, we may not be able to anticipate or react to changing hardwood costs by adjusting our purchasing practices, and we may not always be able to increase the selling prices of our products in response to increases in supply costs. If we cannot address changing hardwood costs appropriately, it could cause our operating results to deteriorate.\nRisks Related to Economic Factors and Our Access to Capital\nCyclicality in the home flooring industry, coupled with our lack of diversity in our lines of business, could cause volatility and risk to our business.\nThe hardwood flooring industry is highly dependent on the remodeling of existing homes and new home construction. Remodeling and new home construction are cyclical and depend on a number of factors which are beyond our control, including interest rates, tax policy, employment levels, consumer confidence, credit availability, real estate prices, demographic trends, weather conditions, natural disasters and general economic conditions.\nIn the event of a decrease in discretionary spending, home remodeling activity or new home construction, demand for our products, including hardwood flooring, could be impacted negatively and our business and operating results could be harmed.\nOur insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not cover existing or future claims.\nWith the large number of pending cases and government investigations, we may be required to defend ourselves and our officers, directors and former employees and we may be subject to financial harm in the event such cases or investigations are adversely determined and insurance coverage will not, or is not sufficient to, cover any related losses. We maintain various insurance policies, including directors and officers insurance, as well as the following:\n\u00b7\nWe are self-insured on certain health insurance plans and workers\u2019 compensation coverage and are responsible for losses up to a certain limit for these respective plans.\n\u00b7\nWe continue to be responsible for losses up to a certain limit for general liability and property damage insurance.\n\u00b7\nOur professional liability and cyber security insurance policies contain limitations on the amount and scope of coverage.\nFor policies under which we are responsible for losses, we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than those recorded, which could adversely impact our operating results. Additionally, our recent experience could limit our ability to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage, subjecting us to further loss, or could require significantly increased premiums.\nThe inability to access our Revolving Credit Facility or other sources of capital, could cause our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations to suffer.\nWe have relied on and expect to continue to rely on a bank credit agreement to fund our seasonal needs for working capital. We have signed a commitment letter to increase the amounts available under this Revolving Credit Facility and may need to access additional sources of capital to satisfy our liquidity needs. Our access to the Revolving Credit Facility depends on our ability to meet the conditions for borrowing, including that all representations are true and correct at the time of the borrowing. There is no assurance that we will be able to consummate the commitment letter. Also, there is no assurance that we could obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to meet these requirements or obtain additional or alternative sources of capital could impact:\n\u00b7\nour ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, store expansion and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nour ability to meet our liquidity needs, arising from, among other things, legal matters; and\n\u00b7\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nRisks Related to Our Information Technology\nWe may incur costs and losses resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer information.\nWe accept electronic payment cards for payment in our stores and through our call center. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. As a result, we may become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these types of incidents. Further, a compromise of our security systems that results in our customers\u2019 personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations and financial condition, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. A security breach could also require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.\nAdditionally, privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance.\nIf our management information systems, including our website or our call center, experience disruptions, it could disrupt our business and reduce our net sales.\nWe depend on our management information systems to integrate the activities of our stores, website and call center, to process orders, to respond to customer inquiries, to manage inventory, to purchase merchandise and to sell and ship goods on a timely basis. We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer \u201chackers\u201d or other causes. We may incur significant expenses in order to repair any such operational problems. Any significant disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed, which could result in delays in the delivery of products to our stores and customers or lost sales. Moreover, our entire corporate network, including our telephone lines, is on an Internet-based network, which is vulnerable to certain risks and uncertainties, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches and customer privacy concerns. Accordingly, if our network is disrupted or if we cannot successfully maintain our website and call center in good working order, we may experience delayed communications within our operations and between our customers and ourselves, and may not be able to communicate at all via our network, including via telephones connected to our network.\nAlternative e-commerce and online shopping offerings may erode our customer base and adversely affect our business.\nOur long-term future depends heavily upon the general public\u2019s willingness to use our stores as a means to purchase goods. In recent years, e-commerce has become more widely accepted as a means of purchasing consumer goods and services, which could adversely impact customer traffic in our stores. Additionally, certain of our competitors offer alternative e-commerce and online shopping. If consumers use alternative e-commerce and online shopping offerings to conduct business as opposed to our store locations, it could materially adversely impact our net sales and operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Competitive Positioning\nA tarnished brand or ineffectiveness of our advertising strategy could result in reduced customer traffic, thereby impacting net sales and profitability.\nWe believe that our growth thus far was achieved in part through our successful investment in local and national advertising. Historically, we have used extensive advertising to encourage customers to drive to our stores, which were generally located some distance from population centers in areas that have lower rents than traditional retail locations. Further, a significant portion of our advertising was directed at the DIY and DIFM customers. While our marketing strategy continues to support these strategies, we have broadened the reach and frequency of our advertising to increase the awareness of our value proposition and the number of customers served. If there is are negative perceptions about our brand to our customers, our advertisements fail to draw customers in the future, or if the cost of advertising or other marketing materials increases significantly, we could experience declines in our net sales and operating results.\nCompetition could cause price declines, decrease demand for our products and decrease our market share.\nWe operate in the wood flooring industry, which is highly fragmented and competitive. We face significant competition from national and regional home improvement chains, national and regional specialty flooring chains, Internet-based companies and privately owned single-site enterprises. We compete on the basis of price, customer service, store location and the range, quality and availability of the hardwood flooring that we offer our customers. If our positioning with regard to one or more of these factors should erode, deteriorate, fail to resonate with consumers or misalign with demand or expectations, our business and results may be negatively impacted.\nOur competitive position is also influenced by the availability, quality and cost of merchandise, labor costs, distribution and sales efficiencies and our productivity compared to that of our competitors. Further, as we expand into new and unfamiliar markets, we may face different competitive environments than in the past. Likewise, as we continue to enhance and develop our product offerings, we may experience new competitive conditions.\nSome of our competitors are larger organizations, have existed longer, are more diversified in the products they offer and have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we have. In addition, our competitors may forecast market developments more accurately than we do, develop products that are superior to ours, produce similar products at a lower cost or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than we do. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors could cause price declines, decrease demand for our products and decrease our market share.\nHardwood flooring may become less popular as compared to other types of floor coverings in the future. For example, our products are made using various hardwood species, including rare exotic hardwood species, and concern over the environmental impact of tree harvesting could shift consumer preferences towards synthetic or inorganic flooring. In addition, hardwood flooring competes against carpet, vinyl sheet, vinyl tile, ceramic tile, natural stone and other types of floor coverings. If consumer preferences shift toward types of floor coverings that we do not sell, we may experience decreased demand for our products.\nAll of these competitive factors may harm us and reduce our net sales and operating results.\nRisks Related to Accounting Standards and Internal Controls\nChanges in accounting standards, subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters, and failures in internal control could significantly affect our financial results.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to, consolidation, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, lease accounting, sales returns reserves, inventories, self-insurance, income taxes, deferred taxes, valuation allowances, unclaimed property laws and litigation, are highly\ncomplex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance, which may have a material effect on our results of operation.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure control could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of our ongoing monitoring of internal control, we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control that require remediation.\nIn the current period, we identified a material weakness as discussed in Item 9A. Additionally, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of internal controls that need improvement. Regardless, we continue to work to remediate and improve our internal controls. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm our reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may be volatile and all or part of any investment in our common stock may be lost.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly based on various factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nunfavorable market reactions to allegations regarding the safety of our products and the related litigation and/or government investigations resulting therefrom, as well as any payments, judgments or other losses in connection with such lawsuits and/or investigations;\n\u00b7\ntrading activity of our current or future stockholders, including common stock transactions by our directors and executive officers;\n\u00b7\nindustry-related trends and growth prospects; and\n\u00b7\nour concentration in the cyclical home furnishings industry.\nIn addition, the stock market may experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies but may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us or our performance.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of research analysts and investors due to various factors.\nResearch analysts and investors develop expectations on how we may perform using a variety of metrics, including, but not limited to, sales, comparable store sales and gross profit. However, in any given quarter, actual performance may vary from these expectations, causing significant fluctuations in our stock price.\nOur anti-takeover defense provisions may cause our common stock to trade at market prices lower than it might absent such provisions.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include a staggered board, the availability of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, provisions restricting stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders or from taking action by written consent and provisions that set forth advance notice procedures for stockholders\u2019 nominations of directors and proposals of topics for consideration at meetings of stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which relates to business combinations with interested stockholders, applies to us. These provisions may delay, prevent or deter a merger, or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock. In addition, these provisions may cause our common stock to trade at a market price lower than it might absent such provisions.", "PERMNO": 92400, "SIC": 5211, "TIC": "LL"}
