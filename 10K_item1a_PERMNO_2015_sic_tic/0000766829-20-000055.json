The risks described below are not the only ones facing SJW Group and its subsidiaries. Additional risks that SJW Group and its subsidiaries does not yet know of or that it currently thinks are immaterial may also impair its business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, SJW Group and its subsidiaries\u2019 business, operating results or financial condition could be materially affected. In such case, the trading price of SJW Group\u2019s common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment. Investors should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is regulated and may be adversely affected by changes to the regulatory environment.\nOur Water Utility Services are regulated public utilities. The operating revenue of SJWC, Connecticut Water, CLWSC, Maine Water, Avon Water and HVWC is generated primarily from the sale of water at rates authorized by the Regulators. The Regulators set rates that are intended to provide revenues sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, provide funds for replacement of water infrastructure and produce a fair and reasonable return on stockholder common equity. Please refer to Part I, Item 1, \u201cRegulation and Rates\u201d for a discussion of the most recent regulatory proceedings affecting the rates of SJWC and CLWSC. Consequently, our revenue and operating results depend substantially upon the rates the Regulators authorize.\nIn our applications for rate approvals, we rely upon estimates and forecasts to propose rates for approval by the Regulators. No assurance can be given that our estimates and forecasts will be accurate or that the Regulators will agree with our estimates and forecasts and approve our proposed rates. To the extent our authorized rates may be too low, revenues may be insufficient to cover Water Utility Services\u2019 operating expenses, capital requirements and SJW Group\u2019s historical dividend rate. In addition, delays in approving rate increases may negatively affect our operating results and our operating cash flows.\nIn addition, policies and regulations promulgated by the regulators govern the recovery of capital expenditures, the treatment of gains from the sale of real utility property, the offset of production and operating costs, the recovery of the cost of debt, the optimal equity structure, and the financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-tariffed operations. If the regulators implement policies and regulations that will not allow SJWC, Connecticut Water, CLWSC, Maine Water, Avon Water and HVWC to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, Water Utility Services\u2019 future operating results may be adversely affected. Further, from time to time, the commissioners at the Regulators may change. Such changes could lead to changes in policies and regulations and there can be no assurance that the resulting changes in policies and regulation, if any, will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nIf the CPUC disagrees with our calculation of SJWC\u2019s memorandum and balancing accounts, we may be required to make adjustments that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nUnder a 2007 Connecticut law, PURA authorizes regulated water companies to use a rate adjustment mechanism, known as WICA, for eligible projects completed and in service for the benefit of the customers. During 2013, the Maine legislature enacted a law that allows Maine Water for expedited recovery of investments in water systems infrastructure replacement, both treatment and distribution, through WISC, similar to WICA in Connecticut. Maine Water began to use the WISC during 2014. There is no guarantee that these regulatory authorities will approve our applications to recover all or a portion of our capital expenditure or infrastructure investment through such rate adjustment mechanisms, and their failure to do so will adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\nRecovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by the regulatory agencies and could impact the operating results of Water Utility Services.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles for water utilities include the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities as permitted by FASB ASC Topic 980-\u201cRegulated Operations.\u201d In accordance with ASC Topic 980, Water Utility Services record deferred costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recovered in the ratemaking process in a period different from when the costs and credits were incurred. Please refer to Note 1 of the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a summary of net regulatory assets. If the assessment of the probability of recovery in the ratemaking process is incorrect and the applicable ratemaking body determines that a deferred cost is not recoverable through future rate increases, the regulatory assets or liabilities would need to be adjusted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in water supply, water supply costs or the mix of water supply could adversely affect the operating results and business of Water Utility Services.\nSJWC\u2019s supply of water primarily relies upon three main sources: treated water purchased from Valley Water, surface water from its Santa Cruz Mountains watershed, and pumped underground water. Changes and variations in quantities from each of these three sources including changes due to production assets being taken off-line for renovation or non-compliance with regulations affect the overall mix of the water supply, thereby affecting the cost of the water supply. If there is an adverse change to the mix of water supply and SJWC is not allowed by CPUC to recover the additional or increased water supply costs, its operating results may be adversely affected.\nValley Water receives an allotment of water from state and federal water projects. If SJWC has difficulties obtaining a high quality water supply from Valley Water due to availability, environmental, legal or regulatory actions or other restrictions (see also Part I, Item 1, \u201cWater Supply\u201d), it may not be able to fully satisfy customer demand in its service area and its operating results and business may be adversely affected. Additionally, the availability of water from SJWC\u2019s Santa Cruz Mountain watershed depends on the weather and fluctuates with each season. In a normal year, surface water supply provides 6% to 8% of the total water supply of the system. In a season with little rainfall, such as the record drought conditions in 2015 and most of 2016, water supply from surface water sources may be low, thereby causing SJWC to increase the amount of water purchased from outside sources at a higher cost than surface water, thus increasing water production expenses. When drought conditions occur, we may be required to rely more heavily on purchased water than surface water, which would increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, SJWC\u2019s ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing overall water production expenses and adversely affecting our operating results.\nBecause the extraction of water from the groundwater basin and the operation of the water distribution system require a significant amount of energy, increases in energy prices could increase operating expenses of SJWC. The cost of energy is beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially based on load supply and demand. Therefore, SJWC cannot be certain that it will be able to contain energy costs into the future.\nSJWC continues to utilize Pacific Gas & Electric\u2019s time of use rate schedules to minimize its overall energy costs primarily for groundwater pumping. Optimization and energy management efficiency are achieved through the implementation of software applications that control pumps based on demand and cost of energy. An increase in demand or a reduction in the availability of surface water or import water could result in the need to pump more water during peak hours which may adversely affect the operating results of SJWC.\nSJWC has been granted permission by CPUC to employ certain balancing accounts to track various water supply expenses and revenues. There is no assurance that CPUC will allow recovery or refund of these balances when submitted by SJWC.\nCLWSC\u2019s primary water supply is 6,900 acre-feet of water which is pumped from Canyon Lake at three lake intakes or delivered as treated water from GBRA\u2019s Western Canyon Pipeline, in accordance with the terms of its contracts with the GBRA, which are long-term take-or-pay contracts. This supply is supplemented by groundwater pumped from wells. While\nthe contract provides a committed long-term water supply for future demand, CLWSC customers currently do not use the volume of water allowed under the contracts which increases the cost of water for existing customers, and there is no assurance that future demands up to the committed supply volume will occur. Texas faces long-term water supply constraints similar to California as described above and while current water supply exceeds demand, CLWSC may not be able to obtain adequate water supply to meet customer demand or may be required to procure more costly water from other sources. (See also Part I, Item 1, \u201cWater Supply\u201d).\nThe Connecticut regulated operations derive their rights and franchises to operate from state laws that are subject to alteration, amendment or repeal. Our franchises are free from restrictions, are unlimited as to time, and authorize us to sell potable water in all towns we now serve. Under Connecticut law, these rights and franchises are transferred to the surviving corporation in any merger. None of the Connecticut regulated operations were parties in the recent merger between the parent companies CTWS and SJW Group and no conditions were imposed that would adversely impact those rights and franchises. The companies further rely on environmental permits or registrations authorizing the use of water supplies in Connecticut, and those were not altered as a result of the merger with SJW Group. There is the possibility that the state could revoke our franchises and allow a governmental entity to take over some or all of our systems or could modify laws related to water supply use. From time to time such legislation has been contemplated. The Connecticut regulated operations do not face long-term water supply constraints, however, in times of persistent dry weather and continued drought conditions, Connecticut Water has requested that customers voluntarily reduce water usage.\nMaine Water Company relies on legislatively granted water rights in order to serve customers. In some instances, these rights were granted to predecessor water companies specially chartered by the Maine legislature many decades ago, with those entities later having been merged into Maine Water. The legislation incorporating these predecessor water companies did not address whether chartered rights may be transferred to another entity without special legislative action. The Maine Business Corporation Act generally provides that property and contract rights of a merged corporation are vested in the survivor corporation without reversion or impairment. In the MPUC proceedings that approved the mergers of these Maine Water predecessor companies, the survivorship of water rights was not contested and Maine Water has not sought specific legislation to reaffirm the transfer of chartered rights granted to predecessor water companies. Maine Water does not face long-term water supply constraints.\nClimate change may also impact water supply. For example, severity of drought conditions may impact the availability of water to all Water Utility Services and rising sea levels may impact the availability of groundwater available to SJWC and CLWSC.\nFluctuations in customer demand for water due to seasonality, restrictions of use, weather, and lifestyle can adversely affect operating results.\nWater Utility Services are seasonal, thus quarterly fluctuation in results of operations may be significant. Rainfall and other weather conditions also affect Water Utility Services. Water consumption typically increases during the third quarter of each year when weather tends to be warm and dry. In periods of drought, if customers are encouraged or required to conserve water due to a shortage of water supply or restriction of use, revenue tends to be lower. Similarly, in unusually wet periods, water supply tends to be higher and customer demand tends to be lower, again resulting in lower revenues. Furthermore, certain lifestyle choices made by customers can affect demand for water. For example, a significant portion of residential water use is for outside irrigation of lawns and landscaping. If there is a decreased desire by customers to maintain landscaping for their homes or restrictions are placed on outside irrigation, residential water demand would decrease, which would result in lower revenues.\nConservation efforts and construction codes, which require the use of low-flow plumbing fixtures, could diminish water consumption and result in reduced revenue. In addition, in time of drought, water conservation may become a regulatory requirement that impacts the water usage of our customers. For example, in response to the severe drought in California in 2015 and 2016, Valley Water extended their call for 30% conservation and restrictions on outdoor watering of ornamental landscapes two days a week through June 30, 2016. Following the improvement of drought condition in late 2016 and 2017, Valley Water reduced its conservation target from 30% to 20% and also increased the number of outdoor watering days from two days to three days effective July 1, 2016 through January 31, 2017. On January 24, 2017, Valley Water maintained their call for 20% conservation and restrictions on outdoor watering for ornamental landscapes to no more than three days a week, effective February 1, 2017. On June 13, 2017, Valley Water adopted Resolution 17-43 to encourage making water conservation a way of life in California through recommendations on watering schedules and a call for customers to achieve a 20% reduction in water use as compared to 2013. While the drought has ended Valley Water has maintained a conservation target at 20%. (See also Part I, Item 1, \u201cWater Supply\u201d).\nThe implementation of mandatory conservation measures has resulted and is expected to result in lower water usage by our customers which may adversely affect our results of operation. If the current conservation measures continue, or if new measures are imposed in response to drought conditions in the future, we may experience fluctuations in the timing of or a reduction in customer revenue. Furthermore, while the CPUC previously approved a WCMA which allows companies to\nrecover revenue reductions due to water conservation activities and certain conservation related costs, collection of such memorandum accounts are subject to a review and approval process by CPUC, which can be lengthy, and there is no assurance that we will be able to recover in a timely manner all or some of the revenue and costs recorded in the memorandum accounts. If drought conditions ease and the State Water Board and Valley Water no longer mandate water conservation, the Company may no longer be allowed to recover revenue lost due to continued conservation activities under the WCMA account and would therefore be exposed to differences between actual and authorized usage. This could result in lower revenues. In December 2019, the CPUC denied SJWC\u2019s request in Advice Letter No. 532 to recover the 2018 balances of WCMA and was ordered to remove the WCMA accounts. As a result of the decision, during the year ended December 31, 2019, SJWC wrote off a total balance of $9.4 million recorded in the 2018 WCMA and $0.6 million recorded in the 2019 WCMA memorandum accounts. (See also Note 1, \u201cSummary of Accounting Principles\u201d in the consolidated financial statements).\nSimilar to SJWC, Connecticut Water, Avon Water, HVWC and Maine Water have also been impacted by increased water conservation, as well as the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential users. There has been a trend of declining per customer residential water usage in Connecticut and Maine over the last several years. CTWS\u2019s regulated businesses at Maine Water and at Avon Water are heavily dependent on revenue generated from rates it charges to its residential customers for the volume of water they use. The rates Connecticut Water, Avon Water, HVWC and Maine Water charge for its water is regulated by PURA in Connecticut and MPUC in Maine, and CTWS\u2019s water services subsidiaries may not unilaterally adjust their rates to reflect changes in demand. A declining volume of residential water usage may have a negative impact on our operating revenues in the future if regulators do not reflect usage declines in the rate setting design process. Although the legislatures in Maine and Connecticut have provided enabling legislation for water utilities to implement revenue adjustment mechanisms to allow for recovery of authorized rates where conservation has occurred and consumption has declined and such a mechanism has been approved by PURA for Connecticut Water and Heritage Village Water, this mechanism has yet to be implemented at Avon Water and Maine Water.\nStreamflow Regulations in New England could potentially impact our ability to serve our customers.\nIn December 2011, regulations concerning the flow of water in Connecticut\u2019s rivers and streams were adopted. As promulgated, the regulations require that certain downstream releases be made from seven of Connecticut Water\u2019s eighteen active reservoirs no later than ten years following the adoption of stream classifications by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (\u201cDEEP\u201d). Currently, downstream releases are made at two locations. No groundwater supply wells are affected by the regulations.\nDEEP has finalized stream classifications in all areas of Connecticut where Connecticut Water maintains and operates sources of supply. The Company remains engaged in the process in order to minimize impact to our available water supply. Although modified from prior versions, the regulations still have the potential to lower our safe yield, raise our capital and operating expenses and adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Although costs associated with the regulations may be recovered in the form of higher rates and Connecticut law allows for a WICA surcharge to recover capital improvement costs necessary to achieve compliance with the regulations, there can be no assurance PURA would approve rate increases to enable us to recover all such costs and surcharges.\nMaine also has regulations that govern the flow of water in rivers and streams and also govern lake levels on great ponds. Code of Maine Rules Chapter 587 (\u201cChapter 587\u201d) regulates any activity that alters the flow or level of classified state waters after August 2007. Maine Water operates five water systems that use surface waters governed by Chapter 587. Maine Water has operated in full compliance with the chapter since its effective date and fully expects continued compliance. For public water systems, Chapter 587 allows the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (\u201cMDEP\u201d) to impose site specific conditions in locations where Maine\u2019s water quality classifications are not being met. Any conditions proposed on a water withdrawal by a public water system must consider the provisions of any legislative charter, the watershed protection benefits provided by the utility and the financial viability of the utility. Further, any conditions imposed must be accommodated by the existing MPUC approved rate schedule for the utility and may not, in and of themselves, cause a utility to request a rate increase from their customers. To date, the MDEP has not imposed any withdrawal conditions on any public water system in Maine.\nA contamination event or other decline in source water quality could affect the water supply of Water Utility Services and therefore adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWater Utility Services is required under environmental regulations to comply with water quality requirements. Through water quality compliance programs, Water Utility Services continually monitors for contamination and pollution of its sources of water. In addition, a watershed management program provides a proactive approach to minimize potential contamination activities. There can be no assurance that Water Utility Services will continue to comply with all applicable water quality requirements. In the event a contamination is detected, Water Utility Services must either commence treatment to remove the contaminant or procure water from an alternative source. Either of these results may be costly, may increase future capital expenditures and there can be no assurance that the regulators would approve a rate increase to enable us to recover the costs arising from such remedies. In addition, we could be held liable for consequences arising from hazardous substances or\ncontamination in our water supplies or other environmental damages. Our insurance policies may not cover or may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.\nCTWS\u2019s wastewater operations, wastewater collection and treatment and septage pumping and sludge hauling also involve various unique risks that could impact our company. If collection or treatment systems operated by HVWC fail or do not operate properly, or if there is a spill, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing various damages and injuries, including environmental damage. These risks are most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of wastewater overflow and system failure. Liabilities resulting from such damages and injuries could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWater Utility Services is subject to litigation risks concerning water quality and contamination.\nAlthough Water Utility Services is not a party to any environmental and product-related lawsuits, there is no guarantee that such lawsuits will not occur in the future. If Water Utility Services is subject to an environmental or product-related lawsuit, they might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether it would be able to recover the legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties. Although Water Utility Services has liability insurance coverage for bodily injury and property damage, pollution liability is excluded from this coverage and our excess liability coverage. Pollution liability coverage is in place for the majority of the SJW Group locations and operations, but is subject to exclusions and limitations. Costs for defense are included within the limit of insurance on the pollution liability policy. In addition, any complaints or lawsuits against us based on water quality and contamination may receive negative publicity that can damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and trading price of our common stock.\nWater Utility Services is subject to possible litigation or regulatory enforcement action concerning water discharges to Waters of the United States (\u201cWOTUS\u201d).\nRegulatory actions and fines related to discharges of water to WOTUS against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years. If Water Utility Services is subject to a litigation or regulatory enforcement action, it might incur significant costs in fines and restoration efforts, and it is uncertain whether Water Utility Services would be able to recover some or all of such costs from ratepayers or other third parties. In addition, any litigation or regulatory enforcement action against us regarding a water discharge and/or resulting environmental impact may receive negative publicity that can damage our reputation and adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nNew or more stringent environmental regulations could increase Water Utility Services\u2019 operating costs and affect its business.\nWater Utility Services are subject to water quality and pollution control regulations issued by the EPA and environmental laws and regulations administered by the respective states and local regulatory agencies.\nNew or more stringent environmental and water quality regulations could increase Water Utility Services\u2019 water quality compliance costs, hamper Water Utility Services\u2019 available water supplies, and increase future capital expenditures.\nUnder the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, Water Utility Services is subject to regulation by the EPA relating to the quality of water it sells and treatment techniques it uses to make the water potable. The EPA promulgates, from time to time, nationally applicable standards, including maximum contaminant levels for drinking water. Additional or more stringent requirements may be adopted by each state. There can be no assurance that Water Utility Services will be able to continue to comply with all water quality requirements.\nWater Utility Services has implemented monitoring activities and installed specific water treatment improvements in order to comply with existing maximum contaminant levels and plan for compliance with future drinking water regulations. However, the EPA and the respective state agencies have continuing authority to issue additional regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act. New or more stringent environmental standards could be imposed that will raise Water Utility Services\u2019 operating costs and capital expenditures, including requirements for increased monitoring, additional treatment of underground water supplies, fluoridation of all supplies, more stringent performance standards for treatment plants, additional procedures to further reduce levels of disinfection by-products, and more comprehensive measures to monitor, reduce or eliminate known or newly identified contaminants. There are currently limited regulatory mechanisms and procedures available to us for the recovery of such costs and there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered and failure to do so may adversely affect our operating results.\nThe water utility business requires significant capital expenditures that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If SJW Group and its subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient operating cash flows and obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we and our subsidiaries borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe water utility business is capital-intensive. Expenditure levels for renewal and modernization of the system will grow at an increasing rate as components reach the end of their useful lives. SJW Group\u2019 subsidiaries fund capital expenditures through a variety of sources, including cash received from operations, funds received from developers as contributions or advances, borrowings through lines of credit and debt financings, as well as equity financings by SJW Group. We cannot provide any assurance that the historical sources of funds for capital expenditures will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. A significant change in any of the funding sources could impair the ability of Water Utility Services to fund its capital expenditures, which could impact our ability to grow our utility asset base and earnings. Any increase in the cost of capital through higher interest rates or otherwise could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to raise capital through equity or debt may be affected by the economy and condition of the debt and equity markets. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets or deteriorations in the strength of financial institutions could adversely affect SJW Group\u2019s ability to draw on its lines of credit, issue long-term debt or sell its equity. In addition, government policies, the state of the credit markets and other factors could result in increased interest rates, which would increase SJW Group\u2019s cost of capital. Furthermore, equity financings may result in dilution to our existing stockholders and debt financings may contain covenants that restrict the actions of SJW Group and its subsidiaries. The senior note borrowings of SJW Group, SJWC and CLWSC include certain financial covenants regarding a maximum debt to equity ratio and an interest coverage requirement. In the event the relevant borrower exceeds the maximum debt to equity ratio or interest coverage requirement, we may be restricted from issuing future debt. In addition, the pollution control revenue bonds issued on behalf of SJWC contain affirmative and negative covenants customary for a loan agreement relating to revenue bonds, including, among other things, certain disclosure obligations, the tax exempt status of the interest on the bonds, and limitations and prohibitions on the transfer of projects funded by the loan proceeds and assignment of the loan agreement. CTWS and its subsidiaries are required to comply with certain covenants in connection with their various long term loan agreements. The most restrictive of these covenants is to maintain a consolidated debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 60%. Additionally, Maine Water has restrictions on cash dividends paid based on restricted net assets. In the event that we violate any of these covenants, an event of default may occur and all amounts due under such bonds may be called by the Trustee, which would have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial conditions.\nWe operate in areas subject to natural disasters or that may be the target of terrorist activities.\nWe operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event in northern California, where the majority of our operations are concentrated, or other natural disaster in northern California, Connecticut, Texas or Maine could adversely impact our ability to deliver water to our customers and our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. The Regulators have historically allowed utilities to establish catastrophic event memorandum accounts as a possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that our regulators, or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.\nIn light of the potential threats to the nation\u2019s health and security due to terrorist attacks, we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be significant.\nWhile some of these costs are likely to be recovered in the form of higher rates, there can be no assurance that the Regulators will approve a rate increase to recover all or part of such costs and, as a result, our operating results and business may be adversely affected. Further, despite these tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur.\nOur operations, liquidity, and earnings may be adversely affected by wildfires and risk of fire hazards.\nIt is possible that wildfires and other fire hazards may occur more frequently, be of longer duration or impact larger areas as a result of drought-damaged plants and trees, lower humidity or higher winds that might be occurring as result of changed weather patterns. The effects of these natural disasters in California\u2019s drought-prone areas, such as the Santa Cruz Mountains, the watershed where SJWC obtains approximately 10% of its water supply, may temporarily compromise its surface water supply, resulting in disruption in our services and litigation which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf our surface water supply is compromised, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an alternative water source. If there is an adverse change to the mix of water supply, it may cause an\nincrease in our purchased and pumped water and increase our production expenses substantially, which would adversely affect the operating results of SJWC. There can be no assurance that the CPUC will allow SJWC to recover the additional or increased production expenses.\nIn addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the impacted source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an alternative water source, or to adequately treat the impacted water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, and financial condition. The costs we incur to secure an alternative water source or an increase in draws from our underground water system could be significant and may not be recoverable in rates.\nWildfires may destroy or cause damage to properties, facilities, equipment and other assets owned and operated by SJWC or result in personal injuries to our employees and personnel, which may cause temporary or permanent disruption to our water services. In such a case, we may be required to incur significant expenses to repair, replace or upgrade our assets, or to defend against costly litigation or disputes with third parties, any of which may adversely affect our business operations or financial conditions.\nWhile we maintain a business insurance policy, such policy includes limitation and retention that may reduce, or in some cases eliminate, our ability to recover all or a substantial portion of the losses and damages due to wildfire. Our inability to rely fully on insurance coverage may negatively impact our results of operations. Losses by insurance companies resulting from wildfires in California may also cause insurance coverage for wildfire risks to become more expensive or unavailable under reasonable terms, and our insurance may be inadequate to recover all our losses incurred in a wildfire. Furthermore, we might not be allowed to recover in our rates any increased costs of wildfire insurance or the costs of any uninsured wildfire losses.\nA failure of our reservoirs, storage tanks, mains or distribution networks could result in losses and damages that may adversely affect our financial condition and reputation.\nWe distribute water through an extensive network of mains and store water in reservoirs and storage tanks located across our service areas. The Water Utility Services\u2019 distribution systems were constructed during the period from the early 1900\u2019s through today. A failure of major mains, reservoirs, or tanks could result in injuries and damage to residential and/or commercial property for which we may be responsible, in whole or in part. The failure of major mains, reservoirs or tanks may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and reputation. We also own and operate numerous dams throughout Connecticut and Maine, and a failure of such dams could result in losses and damages that may adversely effect our financial condition and reputation. Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by existing insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.\nOperating under contract water and waste systems in Maine and Connecticut will expose us to new risks.\nCTWS operates a number of water and wastewater systems under operation and maintenance contracts that we assumed with the consummation of the merger with CTWS. Pursuant to these contracts, such systems are operated according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract, and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the system to undertake capital improvements. We may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations. Although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts, those non-compliance events may reflect poorly on us as the operator of the system and harm our reputation, and in some cases, may result in liability to the same extent as if we were the owner.\nWater Utility Services rely on information technology and systems that are key to business operations. A system malfunction, security breach, cyber-attacks or other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect business operations.\nInformation technology is key to the operation of Water Utility Services, including but not limited to payroll, general ledger activities, outsourced bill preparation and remittance processing, providing customer service and the use of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems to operate our distribution system. Among other things, system malfunctions, computer viruses and security breaches could prevent us from operating or monitoring our facilities, billing and collecting cash accurately and timely analysis of financial results. In addition, we collect, process, and store sensitive data from our customers and employees, including personally identifiable information, on our networks. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed without our authorization, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen which could result in legal claims or proceedings, violation of privacy laws or damage to our reputation and customer relationships. Our profitability and cash flow could be affected negatively in the event these systems do not operate effectively or are breached. In addition, we may not be able to develop or acquire information technology that is\ncompetitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we may lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency.\nSJW Land Company and Chester Realty, Inc. have real estate holdings that are subject to various business and investment risks.\nSJW Land Company owns real estate in Tennessee and Chester Realty, Inc. owns real estate in Connecticut. The risks in investing directly in real estate vary depending on the investment strategy and investment objective and include the following:\n\u2022\nLiquidity risk-real estate investments are illiquid. The lag time to build or reduce the real estate portfolio is long.\n\u2022\nObsolescence risk-real estate property is location specific. Location obsolescence can occur due to a decline of a particular sub-market or neighborhood. Functional obsolescence can also occur from physical depreciation, wear and tear, and other architectural and physical features which could be curable or incurable.\n\u2022\nMarket and general economic risks-real estate investment is tied to overall domestic economic growth and, therefore, carries market risk which cannot be eliminated by diversification. Generally, all property types benefit from national economic growth, though the benefits range according to local factors, such as local supply and demand and job creation. Because real estate leases are typically staggered and last for multiple years, there is generally a delayed effect in the performance of real estate in relation to the overall economy. This delayed effect can insulate or deteriorate the financial impact to SJW Land Company and Chester Realty, Inc. in a downturn or an improved economic environment.\n\u2022\nConcentration/Credit risk-the risk of a tenant declaring bankruptcy and seeking relief from its contractual rental obligation could affect the income and the financial results of SJW Land Company and Chester Realty, Inc. This risk is most prevalent in a recessionary environment.\nVacancy rates can climb and market rents can be impacted and weakened by general economic forces, therefore affecting income to SJW Land Company and Chester Realty, Inc.\nThe value of real estate can decrease materially due to a deflationary market, decline in rental income, market cycle of supply and demand, long lag time in real estate development, legislative and governmental actions, environmental concerns, increases in rates of returns demanded by investors, and fluctuation of interest rates, eroding any unrealized capital appreciation and, potentially, invested capital.\nA decrease in the value of a real estate property or increase in vacancy could result in reduced future cash flows to amounts below the property\u2019s current carrying value and could result in an impairment charge.\nThe success of SJW Land Company and Chester Realty, Inc.\u2019s real estate investment strategy depend largely on ongoing local, state and federal land use development activities and regulations, future economic conditions, the development and fluctuations in the sale of the undeveloped properties, the ability to identify the developer/potential buyer of the available-for-sale real estate, the timing of the transaction, favorable tax law, and the ability to maintain and manage portfolio properties. There is no guarantee that we will be able to execute the strategy successfully and failure to do so may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our financial results. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include volatility of the general stock market or the utility index, regulatory developments, public announcement of material development in strategic transactions general economic conditions and trends, actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations, actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts, actual or anticipated developments in our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally, litigation involving us or our industry, and major catastrophic event(s) or sales of large blocks of our stock. Furthermore, we believe that stockholders invest in public stocks in part because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our common stock may decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our common stock, demand for our stock and its trading price may also decrease.\nOur business strategy, which includes acquiring water systems and expanding non-tariffed services, will expose us to new risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business strategy focuses on the following:\n(1)\nRegional regulated water utility operations;\n(2)\nRegional non-tariffed water utility related services provided in accordance with the guidelines established by the Regulators; and\n(3)\nOut-of-region water and utility related services.\nAs part of our pursuit of the above three strategic areas, we consider from time to time opportunities to acquire businesses and assets, for example the merger with CTWS. However, we cannot be certain we will be successful in identifying and consummating any strategic business combination or acquisitions relating to such opportunities. In addition, the execution of our business strategy will expose us to different risks than those associated with the current utility operations. We expect to incur costs in connection with the execution of this strategy and any integration of an acquired business could involve significant costs, the assumption of certain known and unknown liabilities related to the acquired assets, the diversion of management\u2019s time and resources, the potential for a negative impact on SJW Group\u2019s financial position and operating results, entering markets in which SJW Group has no or limited direct prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of any acquired company. Any strategic combination or acquisition we decide to undertake may also impact our ability to finance our business, affect our compliance with regulatory requirements, and impose additional burdens on our operations. Any businesses we acquire may not achieve sales, customer growth and projected profitability that would justify the investment. Any difficulties we encounter in the integration process, including the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting, could interfere with our operations, reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls. SJW Group cannot be certain that any transaction will be successful or that it will not materially harm operating results or our financial condition.\nWe must continue to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial personnel in order to succeed.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, operational and financial managers. There is a significant competition for such personnel in our industry. The loss of the services of any member of our management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace. We try to ensure that we offer competitive compensation and benefits as well as opportunities for continued development, and we continually strive to recruit and train qualified personnel and retain key employees. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to grow and operate profitably.\nAdverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension costs and pension plan funding requirements.\nA substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. Our pension costs and the funded status of the plan are affected by a number of factors including the discount rate, applicable mortality tables, mortality rates of plan participants, investment returns on plan assets, and pension reform legislation. Any change in such factors could result in an increase in future pension costs and an increase in our pension liability, requiring an increase in plan contributions which may adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\nWork stoppages, other labor relations matters and epidemic or pandemic illness events could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 225 of our 732 total employees were union members. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the Utility Workers of America, except certain employees in the engineering department who are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers. Only employees at SJWC are union members.\nWe may experience difficulties and delays in the collective bargaining process to reach suitable agreements with union employees, particularly in light of increasing healthcare and pension costs. In addition, changes in applicable law and regulations could have an adverse effect on management\u2019s negotiating position with the unions. Labor actions, work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages, and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during future negotiations may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAdditionally, an epidemic or pandemic illness event could result in part, or all, of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure, provide customer service or perform other tasks necessary to conduct SJW Group\u2019s business. We can give no assurance that in the event of an epidemic or pandemic illness event we would be able to maintain sufficient human resources to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the areas that we serve and any interruption or slowdown in our service may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business has inherently dangerous workplaces. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to not only people impacts but also to financial losses such as penalties and other liabilities.\nOur safety record is critical to our reputation. We maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees, customers, vendors and the public. Although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards and aim for zero injuries, it is extremely difficult to avoid accidents at all times.\nOur business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of equipment, moving vehicles, pressurized water, underground trenches and vaults, chemicals and other regulated materials. On many sites we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. If we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others, our employees and others may be injured or die. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our operations can involve the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals, which, if improperly handled, stored or disposed of, could subject us to penalties or other liabilities. We are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. Although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environment work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations or procedures could subject us to a liability.\nWe may be at risk for litigation under the principle of inverse condemnation for activities in the normal course of business which have a damaging effect on private property.\nUnder the California legal doctrine of inverse condemnation, a public utility taking or damaging private property can be responsible to the property owners for compensation, even when damage occurs through no fault or negligence of the utility company and regardless of whether the damage could be foreseen. Based upon existing California case law, SJWC could be sued under the doctrine of inverse condemnation and held liable if its facilities, operations or property, such as mains, fire hydrants, power lines and other equipment, damage private property.\nA court finding of inverse condemnation does not obligate the CPUC to allow SJWC to recover damage awards or pass on costs to ratepayers. SJWC\u2019s liquidity, earnings, and operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to recover the costs of paying claims for damages caused by the operation and maintenance of our property from customers or through insurance.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also make it more difficult for stockholders to influence our policies or may reduce the rights of stockholders.\nSJW Group\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of SJW Group. These provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nAuthorizing Board of Directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock;\n\u2022\nProhibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nLimiting the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders to only stockholders holding not less than 20% of outstanding voting power; and\n\u2022\nRequiring advance notification of stockholder nomination of directors and proposals.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders of SJW Group to replace or remove its current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) govern SJW Group. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of the Board of Directors.\nFurthermore, SJW Group\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation provides that a state or federal court located within Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum (unless the company consents in writing to the selection of an alternate forum) for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of SJW Group, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of SJW Group to the company or its stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Such \u201cexclusive forum\u201d provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with SJW Group or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.\nRisks Related to SJW Group and CTWS as a Combined Company Following Closing of the Merger\nCPUC has initiated an investigation to review the merger with CTWS, which may impose costs or certain conditions on us, but the merger was consummated prior to CPUC\u2019s issuance of an order with respect to its investigation.\nCPUC at its July 12, 2018 meeting approved an OII into the merger with CTWS. The order includes: investigating CPUC\u2019s authority over the merger, whether the merger is in the public interest; whether the merger preserves CPUC\u2019s jurisdiction over SJWC and CPUC\u2019s capacity to effectively regulate utility operations in the State of California; the effect of the Merger on our and CTWS\u2019s employees, shareholders, customers and communities in which they operate and the State of California; whether the benefits likely exceed any detrimental effects of the merger; and whether the CPUC should consider conditions or mitigation measures to prevent any adverse consequences which may result from the merger, and if so, what should be those conditions or measures. The order had stated that CPUC planned to substantially complete the inquiry in a manner sufficiently timely to allow the merger to go forward by the end of 2018, if appropriate. However, as a result of unexpected delays in CPUC\u2019s scheduling of a planned public participation hearing, which was held January 31, 2019, issuance of a proposed decision was delayed. On March 4, 2019, the presiding administrative law judge suspended CPUC investigation until a final decision was reached by PURA. After securing the required approvals from both PURA and MPUC, SJW Group announced the close of the merger on October 9, 2019, and notified the CPUC accordingly.\nCompletion of CPUC\u2019s investigation was not a condition to the consummation of the merger. We are unable to predict what action, if any, the CPUC will take with respect to the merger upon the conclusion of the OII proceeding. Such actions may impose significant costs and conditions on us, which may have an adverse effect on our business operation and financial conditions, and may negate some or all of the benefits that we expect as a result of the Merger.\nWe incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the merger with CTWS, and this additional indebtedness may reduce our business and operational flexibility and increase our borrowing costs.\nTo finance the merger, we incurred an aggregate of $510 million of additional indebtedness, a substantial increase compared to our indebtedness prior to the merger. Our increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio in comparison to that of our recent historical basis may have the effect, among other things, of: reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business, industry and economic conditions; increasing borrowing costs; placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt; potentially having an adverse affect on our issuer and issue ratings; requiring additional cash flow to be used to service debt instead of for other purposes; and potentially impairing our ability to obtain other financing.\nIn addition, the terms and conditions of such indebtedness, including financial covenants and restrictive covenants, may reduce our business flexibility and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The agreements governing the indebtedness incurred in connection with the merger contain covenants that impose significant operating and financial limitations and restrictions on us, including restrictions on the ability to enter particular transactions and engage in other activities that we may believe will be advisable or necessary for the combined company\u2019s business. In addition, failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future debt agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other existing agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of indebtedness under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing such indebtedness. Under certain circumstances, we may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations under our indebtedness, including principal and interest payments, which, if not cured, may cause an event of default.\nWe may not have discovered undisclosed liabilities of CTWS during our due diligence process.\nIn the course of the due diligence review of CTWS that we conducted prior to the execution of the merger agreement, we may not have discovered, or may have been unable to quantify, undisclosed liabilities of CTWS and its subsidiaries, and our stockholders may not be indemnified for any of these liabilities. Examples of such undisclosed liabilities may include, but are not limited to, pending or threatened litigation or regulatory matters. Any such undisclosed liabilities could have an adverse effect the business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the combined company and on the value of our stock following the completion of the merger.\nUncertainties associated within the combined company may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company.\nThe combined companies are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of the officers and other key employees to execute their business plans, and its success will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees of the combined company may experience uncertainty about their roles, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of the combined company to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management\npersonnel and other key employees to the same extent that SJW Group and CTWS were previously able to attract or retain their own employees before the merger. A failure by the combined company to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees could have a negative impact on its businesses.\nThe combined company is expected to incur additional costs in connection with the CTWS merger, including costs to integrate SJW Group and CTWS.\nSJW Group has incurred, and is expected to incur additional, substantial expenses in connection with integrating SJW Group and CTWS. Close of the CTWS merger occurred on October 9, 2019. There is a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems at each company that must be integrated, including accounting and finance, payroll, revenue management, commercial operations, risk management and employee benefits. While we assumed that a certain level of integration expenses would be incurred, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of such expenses, and we may encounter unexpected difficulties and challenges that would require us to incur additional expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. In addition, integration expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the benefits that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative public company and other related costs expected from the transaction. These integration expenses could result in the combined company taking significant charges against earnings and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.\nSJW Group has committed to certain \u201cring-fencing\u201d measures which will enhance CTWS\u2019s separateness from SJW Group, which may limit SJW Group\u2019s ability to influence the management and policies of CTWS (beyond the limitations included in other existing governance mechanisms).\nPursuant to the agreements related to the Merger and commitments made by SJW Group as part of the application for PURA and MPUC approval of the merger with CTWS, SJW Group has instituted certain \u201cring-fencing\u201d measures to enhance CTWS\u2019s separateness from SJW Group and to mitigate the risk that CTWS would be negatively impacted in the event of a bankruptcy or other adverse financial developments affecting SJW Group or its non-ring-fenced affiliates. These commitments became effective upon the closing of the Merger.\nIn order to satisfy the ring-fencing commitments, SJW Group formed SJWNE, LLC a wholly-owned special purpose entity (\u201cSPE\u201d) to own the capital stock of CTWS. The SPE, CTWS and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCTWS Entities\u201d) adopted certain measures designed to enhance their separateness from SJW Group, with the intention of mitigating the effects on the CTWS Entities of any bankruptcy of SJW Group and its affiliates other than the CTWS Entities (collectively, the \u201cNon-CTWS Entities\u201d). As a result of these ring-fencing measures, in certain situations, SJW Group will be restricted in its ability to access assets of the CTWS Entities as dividends or intracompany loans to satisfy the debt or contractual obligations of any Non-CTWS Entity, including any indebtedness or other contractual obligations of SJW Group. In addition, the ring-fencing structure may negatively impact SJW Group\u2019s ability to achieve certain benefits, including synergies and economies of scale to reduce operating costs of the combined entity, that it anticipates will result from the merger. This ring-fencing structure also subjects SJW Group and the CTWS Entities to certain governance, operational and financial restrictions following the closing of the merger. Accordingly, SJW Group may be restricted in its ability to direct the management, policies and operations of the CTWS Entities, including the deployment or disposition of their respective assets, declarations of dividends, strategic planning and other important corporate issues. Further, the CTWS Entities\u2019 directors have considerable autonomy and, as described in our commitments, have a duty to act in the best interest of the CTWS Entities consistent with the ring-fencing structure and applicable law, which may be contrary to SJW Group\u2019s best interests or be in opposition to SJW Group\u2019s preferred strategic direction for the CTWS Entities. To the extent they take actions that are not in SJW Group\u2019s interests, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nThe combined company is and will be affected by developments in the water utility industry, including changes in regulation. A failure to adapt to the changing regulatory environment could adversely affect the stability of the combined company\u2019s earnings.\nBecause the SJW Group and its subsidiaries are regulated in the United States at the federal level and in California, Texas, Connecticut and Maine at the state level, it is and will continue to be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. The combined company and/or its subsidiaries are now subject in the United States to federal regulation as well as to extensive state regulation in the states in which the combined company operates. The costs, burdens and complexities associated with complying with these regulatory jurisdictions may have an adverse effect on the combined company. Moreover, potential legislative or regulatory changes may create greater risks to the stability of the combined company\u2019s earnings generally.\nSJW Group\u2019s dividend policy is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by legal and contractual requirements.\nWe anticipate to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend now that the merger is completed, though any such determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, earnings, legal requirements, including limitations under Delaware law, restrictions in our credit agreements and other debt instruments that limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and other factors the board of directors deems relevant. The board of directors of SJW Group may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, our subsidiaries may be subject to restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us, including under state law, pursuant to regulatory commitments and under their credit agreements and other debt instruments. In this regard, the CTWS Entities are limited from paying dividends to us in certain circumstances under PURA and MPUC regulatory commitments. Any inability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends may have a material and adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 54199, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "SJW"}
