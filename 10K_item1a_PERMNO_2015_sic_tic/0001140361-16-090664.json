{"cik": "825411", "company": "SEVCON, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-12-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\nRISK FACTORS\nCERTAIN RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nIn addition to the market risk factors relating to foreign currency and interest rate risk set out in Item 7 on page 16, the Company believes that the following represent the most significant risk factors related to its business, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and share price:\nThe Bassi business we acquired may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur acquisition of Bassi S.r.l. was a significant transaction for us. If we fail to successfully integrate and manage its business, or if the acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expect, our operating results will be adversely affected. Among the risks are the following:\nCapital markets are cyclical and weakness in the United States and international economies may harm our business.\n\u00b7\nthe number of customers for Bassi products may not grow as predicted and demand for chargers may fall short of forecasts;\n\u00b7\nthere may be unanticipated difficulties in operating the acquired business, whether due to technological issues, the potential incompatibility of business cultures, or otherwise;\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty entering new markets where we have limited or no prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to combine the two companies\u2019 product lines as effectively as we anticipate, and the market for the combined products may not be as great as we believe;\n\u00b7\nthere are risks inherent in Bassi\u2019s sole source manufacturing that may hinder us from producing as much Bassi product as we anticipate;\n\u00b7\nour management resources may be inadequate, or there may be other barriers, to successfully integrate the two companies\u2019 operations and establish suitable financial controls;\n\u00b7\nWe may incur unanticipated legal or financial disabilities in the acquired business\nThe Company\u2019s traditional customers are mainly manufacturers of capital goods such as fork lift trucks, aerial lifts and railway signaling equipment. These markets are cyclical and depend heavily on worldwide transportation, shipping and other economic activity. They experienced a significant decline in demand during the recent global recession. Further, as our business has expanded globally, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in global economic conditions. Market conditions fluctuate, and there is considerable economic instability, particularly in the Eurozone. As a result, current or potential customers may be unable to fund purchases or manufacturing of products, which could cause them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products or not to pay the Company or to delay paying for previously purchased products. In addition, continuing instability in the European credit markets may cause the Company to lose its current overdraft facilities and be unable otherwise to obtain financing for operations as needed.\nDemand for on-road electric vehicles incorporating our products may not materialize.\nThe Company is increasingly involved in developing products for the on-road electric vehicle market. We have relationships with several customers that incorporate our products into their EV products. Our competitors and others are also developing products for other entrants in the EV market, with similar and competing technologies. If our customers\u2019 products or technology are not successful commercially, or if worldwide demand for EVs fails to grow as much as we hope, we may not realize the anticipated demand for our products in the EV market, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIndex\nThe Company relies on a small number of key customers for a substantial portion of its revenues.\nTen customers accounted for 34% of the Company\u2019s revenues in 2016 and the largest customer accounted for 7% of revenues. Although we have had business relationships with some of these customers for many years, our relationships with on-road EV customers are newer and, in any event, there are no long-term contractual supply agreements in place with any customer. Accordingly our performance could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these key customers.\nThe Company has substantial sales and operations outside the United States that could be adversely affected by changes in international markets.\nA significant portion of our operations is located, and a significant portion of our business comes from, outside the United States. Accordingly, our performance could be adversely affected by economic downturns in Europe or the Far East as well as in the United States. A consequence of significant international business is that a large percentage of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies that fluctuate in value versus the U.S. dollar. Significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can and do have a material impact on our financial results, which are reported in U.S. dollars. Other risks associated with international business include: changing regulatory practices and tariffs; staffing and managing international operations, including complying with local employment laws; longer collection cycles in certain areas; and changes in tax and other laws.\nThe loss of government support may adversely affect the Company\u2019s Chinese Joint Venture\nThe Company has a joint venture to market product in China. The Chinese market is volatile and is susceptible to additional volatility based on the promotion or absence of government support. Should the Chinese government change its support for environmental improvement, it may adversely affect the sales of hybrid and pure electric vehicles and our ability to grow as quickly as the Company envisages.\nThe continuing debt crisis in the Eurozone may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nThere continues to be significant uncertainty about the stability of global credit and financial markets in light of the continuing debt crisis in certain European countries. A default or a withdrawal from the Eurozone by any of the countries involved, or the uncertainty alone, could cause the value of the Euro to deteriorate. This, or a change to a local currency, would reduce the purchasing power of affected European customers. We are unable to predict the likelihood of any of these events but, if any occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nProgram development timescales are long and can be cancelled, depriving us of product sales\nIn certain markets in which the Company operates, and in particular in the Company\u2019s new market sectors, non-recurring engineering development programs may take several years to complete, and programs can be cancelled by the customer at short notice. Cancellation of an engineering development program would potentially result in the Company not being able to sell the expected products.\nProduction readiness is outside our control\nIn some new markets the Company\u2019s customer is responsible for ensuring that all of the components of their vehicle, working in unison, comply with local governmental regulations in order to achieve the necessary certification to proceed to volume production. Even though the Company\u2019s product performs to specification in all respects, the customer\u2019s vehicle may fail to satisfy overall the local governmental regulations due to the failure of one or more components supplied by other suppliers resulting in a project not proceeding to volume production.\nThe Company\u2019s commitment to make defined benefit pension contributions could adversely impact its financial position.\nIt is estimated that the Company will make contributions to its frozen U.K. and U.S. defined benefit pension plans of approximately $883,000 in 2017 and at a similar level in subsequent years. Should the Company suffer a material reduction in revenues this commitment could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial position.\nIndex\nSingle source materials and sub-contractors may not meet the Company\u2019s needs.\nThe Company relies on single, or a small number of, suppliers and sub-contractors for its requirements for most components, sub-assemblies and finished products. In the event that such suppliers and sub-contractors are unable or unwilling to continue supplying the Company, or to meet the Company\u2019s cost and quality targets or needs for timely delivery, there is no certainty that the Company would be able to establish alternative sources of supply in time to meet customer demand.\nDamage to the Company\u2019s or sub-contractors\u2019 buildings would hurt results.\nIn the electronic controls segment, the majority of the Company\u2019s finished product is produced in two separate plants in Poland and Malaysia; these plants are owned by sub-contractors. The capacitor business is located in a single plant in Wales and the charger business is located in a single plant in Italy. In the event that any of these plants was to be damaged or destroyed, there is no certainty that the Company would be able to establish alternative facilities in time to meet customer demand. The Company does carry property damage and business interruption insurance but this may not cover certain lost business due to the long-term nature of the relationships with many customers.\nManagement judgment in assessing inventory and warranty reserves may be less than required\nManagement uses its judgment and market information to assess levels of reserve required in certain areas including inventory and warranty. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if product designs change more quickly than forecast, additional inventory reserves may be required. If actual product failure rates and repair or replacement costs differ from management estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty reserve may be required and the Company\u2019s results may be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with financial covenants in our loan agreement could adversely affect us.\nThe Company has a five year credit facility with Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A. (\u201cMPS Bank\u201d) under which it has drawn \u20ac14,000,000 ($15,733,000 as of September 30, 2016). While the credit facility is outstanding, the Company together with its subsidiaries must maintain a leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, minus cash and marketable securities, to EBITDA of the Company and its subsidiaries, measured on a fiscal year-end basis, plus (under a December 2016 amendment) the net cash proceeds received by the Company from the issuance and sale of equity securities during such twelve month period, of not greater than 3.5:1.00 through September 30, 2017, and thereafter not greater than 3.0:1.00. Breach of this covenant would constitute an event of default, after which the interest rate would be increased and the Bank could elect a number of remedies including, but not limited to declaring all obligations (including principal, interest and expenses) immediately due and payable, that would have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to continue operations.\nProduct defect may result in product recall\nIn the event that the Company discovers a product defect that impacts the safety or operation of its products, then a product recall may be necessary which could involve the Company in a substantial unanticipated expense significantly in excess of any reserve that had been made.\nProduct liability claims may have a material adverse effect.\nThe Company\u2019s products are technically complex and are installed and used by third parties. Defects in their design, installation, use or manufacturing may result in product liability claims against the Company. Such claims may result in significant damage awards, and the cost of any such litigation could be material.\nBusinesses we acquire may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipate and may otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe recently made a significant acquisition of a new business, and we regularly consider supplementing our growth by acquiring new businesses. If we do that, but we fail to successfully integrate and manage the businesses we acquire, or if an acquisition does not further our business strategy as we expected, our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Business combinations also involve a number of risks and uncertainties that can have an adverse impact, including that:\nIndex\n\u00b7\nthe costs of acquiring and integrating another business may be materially greater than we anticipate;\n\u00b7\nmanaging an acquired company\u2019s technologies or lines of business or entering new markets where we have limited or no prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions may be more difficult than we anticipate;\n\u00b7\nwe may fail to achieve the expected return on our investments, which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition, including intangible assets and goodwill;\n\u00b7\nthe attention of our management and employees may be diverted;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired business;\n\u00b7\nwe may assume unanticipated legal or financial liabilities;\n\u00b7\nwe may suffer significant increases in our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition; and\n\u00b7\nour existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease if we were to issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with an acquisition.\nRisk relating to the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to withdraw from membership in the European Union\nThe result of the referendum on the United Kingdom\u2019s (or the U.K.) membership in the European Union (E.U.) (referred to as Brexit), voting in favor of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, has caused and could continue to cause disruptions to and have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. Any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions, and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers, and employees. In addition, the referendum result could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations that could, at a minimum, increase our costs.\nThe announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies has and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations, in a number of ways, including:\n\u00b7\nOur international sales are denominated in both the U.S. dollar and currencies other than U.S. dollars. Fluctuations of currency exchange rates may expose us to gains and losses on non U.S. currency transactions and a potential devaluation of the local currencies of our customers relative to the U.S. dollar may impair the purchasing power of our customers and could cause customers to decrease or cancel orders or default on payment; and\n\u00b7\nWe translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for our financial statements. During periods of a strengthening dollar, our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars.\nThe announcement of Brexit has also and may continue to create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget on our products and services.\nAny of these effects of Brexit, among others, could materially adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCertain Risks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock and Trading\nThe following are certain important additional risks related to an investment in our securities.\nOur share price has been volatile and may be influenced by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe market prices for shares of our common stock have been volatile over the years, subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIndex\nIf we continue to fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls and procedures, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business, and investors\u2019 views of us.\nWe are required to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, which are processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are also required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future, our stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nAs discussed in Part II, Item 9A (\u201cControls\u201d) of this Form 10-K, we have had certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Our management team and Board of Directors have devoted and will continue to devote significant efforts to remedy those weaknesses and maintain adequate, effective controls and procedures. We may identify additional material weaknesses in the future. If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our controls and procedures exist and go undetected or unremedied, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future, could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nInsiders and principal stockholders have substantial control over the Company, which could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nOur directors, executive officers and our stockholders who each own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders may be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from those of other stockholders and may vote in a way which may be adverse to the interests of other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 75272, "SIC": 3620, "TIC": "SEV"}
