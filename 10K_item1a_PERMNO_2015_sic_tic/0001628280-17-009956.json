{"cik": "1403085", "company": "JRjr33, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-10-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nReaders should carefully consider the following risks in evaluating our business. The risks described below are the risks that we currently believe are material to our business. However, additional risks not presently known to us, or risks that we currently believe are not material, may also impair our business operations. Readers should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the information set forth in \"Business\" and \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" as well as our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the following risks. If we are adversely affected by such risks, then the market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur inability to file timely and accurate periodic reports has caused us to incur significant additional costs and may continue to affect our stock price and our ability to meet listing requirements going forward.\nAs a public company listed on the NYSE American stock exchange, the Company is required to file annual and quarterly periodic reports containing the financial statements with the SEC within prescribed periods of time and maintain a minimal stockholders' equity. As part of the NYSE American stock exchange listing requirements, the Company is also required to provide periodic reports, or make them available, to stockholders within prescribed periods of time. The Company has not been able to, and may continue to be unable to, maintain the required minimum stockholders' equity, produce timely financial statements, and file these financial statements as part of a periodic report in a timely manner with the SEC or in compliance with the NYSE American stock exchange listing requirements.\nThe Company expects to continue to face many of the risks and challenges which were experienced during the recent extended filing delay periods, including:\n\u2022\nContinued concern on the part of customers, partners, investors, and employees about the consolidated financial condition and extended filing delay status, including potential loss of business opportunities;\n\u2022\nAdditional significant time and expense required to complete future filings and the process of maintaining the listing of the common stock on NYSE American beyond the significant time and expense the Company has already incurred in connection with the accounting review to date;\n\u2022\nContinued distraction to the senior management team and board of directors as the Company works to complete future filings;\n\u2022\nObtaining the minimum level of stockholders' equity required by the NYSE American stock exchange;\n\u2022\nDue to the limited capital available to the organization, the Company will continue to operate with a limited number of accounting personnel and professional resources that may continue to result in failures to timely complete filings.\n\u2022\nLimitations on the ability to raise capital and make acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nThe material weaknesses identified by management continue to contribute to the delays in producing and filing the required periodic reports on a timely basis. Refer to Part II, Item 9A, for the discussion of management identified material weaknesses in internal accounting controls.\n\u2022\nGeneral harm to reputation as a result of the foregoing.\nOn April 15, 2016, July 8, 2016, August 23, 2016, November 22, 2016, and December 22, 2016, the Company received notifications from the Exchange that the failure to timely file the 2015 Form 10-K, March 2016 Form 10-Q, June 2016 Form 10-Q, and September 2016 Form 10-Q resulting in the Company being subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the Company Guide and the Company was advised that in order to maintain the listing on the Exchange, the Company was required to submit to the Exchange a plan detailing actions the Company has taken, or would take, that would bring the Company into compliance with the continued listing standards by January 31, 2017. Upon filing of the September 2016 Form 10-Q on December 30, 2016, the Company regained compliance with the NYSE American; however, on January 10, 2017 the Company received notification from the NYSE American that it is not in compliance with the continued listing standards relating to stockholders\u2019 equity as of September 30, 2016. The Company has failed to file this 2016 Form 10-K on time and there can be no assurance that future filings will be timely filed.\nThe failure to timely file with the SEC the 2015 Form 10-K, the 2016 March Form 10-Q, the 2016 June Form 10-Q, and the 2016 September Form 10-Q are events of default under the senior secured note with Dominion Capital (\"Dominion.\") Dominion agreed to waive each such event of default provided that the Company issued to Dominion 50,000 shares of common stock for each ten (10) business days that each filing was late. In addition, Dominion has provided a waiver such that the failure to comply with any other covenant set forth in Section 14 of the Dominion note would not constitute an event of default under the note, and that any further notice to Dominion under the note in respect of the same would not be required; provided that the Company issued to Dominion 100,000 shares of its common stock; provided that such waiver shall not apply to any compliance failures that occur\nafter January 1, 2017. The Company has cured the default with respect to the untimely filing of the 2015 Form 10-K, the filing of the March 2016 Form 10-Q, the filing of the June 2016 Form 10-Q, and the filing of the September 2016 Form 10-Q by issuing 1,250,000 shares of common stock to Dominion for such failure to timely file these reports with the SEC.\nOn January 10, 2017, the Company received notification (the \"Deficiency Letter\") from the NYSE American that it was not in compliance with certain NYSE American continued listing standards relating to stockholders\u2019 equity as of September 30, 2016. Specifically, the Deficiency Letter stated that the Company is not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(1) (requiring stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.0 million or more if it has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years), Section 1003(a)(ii) (requiring stockholders\u2019 equity of $4.0 million or more if it has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years); and Section 1003(a)(iii) (requiring stockholders\u2019 equity of $6.0 million or more if it has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years). The Deficiency Letter noted that the Company had a stockholders\u2019 equity deficit of $(10.3) million as of September 30, 2016, and has reported net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. The Company was required to, and did, submit a plan to the NYSE American by February 9, 2017, advising of actions it has taken or will take to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by July 10, 2018. On March 17, 2017, the NYSE American notified the Company that it has reviewed the Company\u2019s Plan and determined to accept the Plan and grant a Plan period through July 10, 2018. NYSE Regulation Staff will review the Company periodically for compliance with the initiatives outlined in the Plan. If the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by July 18, 2018, or if the Company does not make progress consistent within the Plan period, NYSE Regulation staff will initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate.\nOn April 18, 2017, the Company received a letter from the NYSE American notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual as a result of its failure to timely file this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing of this Form 10-K is a condition for the Company\u2019s continued listing on the NYSE American as required by Sections 134 and 1101 of the NYSE Company Guide. The Company filed this Form 10-K on October 18, 2017. The Company submitted a plan to the NYSE American on May 18, 2017, advising of actions it has taken or will take to regain compliance with the continued listing standards. The Company has regained compliance with the NYSE American listing standards by filing this Form 10-K with the SEC prior to October 18, 2017. The letter from the NYSE American also notes that the NYSE American may nevertheless commence delisting proceedings at any time if it deems that the circumstances warrant.\nIf the common stock listing on the Exchange is suspended or terminated, or if the stock is removed as a component of certain stock market indices, the stock price could materially suffer. In addition, the Company or members of management could be subject to investigation and sanctions by the SEC and other regulatory authorities. Any or all of the foregoing could also result in the commencement of stockholder lawsuits against the Company. Any such litigation, as well as any proceedings that could in the future arise as a result of a filing delay and the circumstances which gave rise to it, may be time consuming and expensive, may divert management attention from the conduct of business, and could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations, and may expose the Company to costly indemnification obligations to current or former officers, directors, or other personnel, regardless of the outcome of such matter, which may not be adequately covered by insurance.\nWe have suffered operating losses since inception and we may not be able to achieve profitability.\nThe Company had an accumulated deficit of $76.2 million as of December 31, 2016 and $45.3 million as of December 31, 2015. Net losses attributable to JRjr33 totaled $31.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and $13.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The Company expects revenues from the existing portfolio of businesses to continue to decline during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the repositioning of Agel and the continual revenue decline of some of the businesses in the existing portfolio. As a result, the Company is sustaining operating and net losses, and it is possible that the Company may never be able to achieve or sustain the revenue levels necessary to attain profitability.\nWe rely upon our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations to fund our business and if our cash flow from operations is inadequate, we will need to continue to raise capital through a debt or equity financing, if available, or curtail operations.\nOn October 18, 2017, the Company and Rochon Capital Partners negotiated a Funding Request Agreement. The agreement provides the Company funding in the event of a cash shortfall of the Company through October 31, 2018. The Company's evaluation as a going concern is heavily dependent upon the funding set forth in this agreement.\nExcluding the funding request agreement, the adequacy of the Company's cash resources to continue to meet future operational needs depends, in large part, on the ability to increase product sales and/or reduce operating costs. The Company has used a significant portion of its cash and marketable securities in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 to fund the Company's operating loss. If the Company is unsuccessful in generating positive cash flow from operations, the Company could exhaust the available cash resources and be required to secure additional funding through a debt or equity financing. Any such additional funding may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms. In addition, the failure to timely file the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 (\"March Form 10-Q,\") the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (\"June Form 10-Q,\") the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (\"September Form 10-Q,\") and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, precludes the Company from being able to register securities on a registration statement on Form S-3 for a one year period from the filing due date of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which will make it more difficult and expensive to register common stock and attract additional capital. The Company\u2019s warrant holders have a right to a cashless exercise if at the time of exercise a registration statement registering their underlying shares of common stock is not effective, and currently the Company\u2019s registration statement on Form S-3 that originally registered the underlying shares of common stock is not effective.Therefore, without S-3 eligibility it will be unlikely that any warrant holders from the offering will pay cash if they effectuate their exercise within the next year.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.\nThe Company's operating losses, negative cash flows from operations and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company intends to fund operations by raising additional capital, increase sales, and by relying on the Funding Request Agreement; however, that may be insufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Therefore, the Company may need to seek additional sources of funding, such as additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, if available at all. If the Company does not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to execute the intended business.\nAny failure to meet our debt service obligations, or to refinance or repay our outstanding indebtedness as it matures, could materially adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ability to satisfy debt obligations and repay or refinance maturing indebtedness will depend principally upon future operating performance. The Company is required to make monthly payments under the promissory notes that mature on October 22, 2018 and February 14, 2023 that have principal balances of $778,000 and $2.8 million, respectively as of December 31, 2016. In addition, the Company was required to make monthly interest payments on senior secured debt to HSBC Bank PLC in connection to the acquisition of Kleeneze. The HSBC note matured, and was subsequently paid-in-full, on May 19, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, the HSBC note had a balance of $2.5 million that was fully secured by cash shown on the consolidated balance sheet under the 'Other current assets.' As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control, will affect the ability to make payments on and to refinance the debt. If the Company does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy debt service obligations, the Company may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring the debt, incurring additional debt, issuing equity or convertible securities, reducing discretionary expenditures, and selling certain assets (or combinations thereof). The ability to execute such alternative financing plans will depend on the capital markets and the consolidated financial condition of the Company at such time. In addition, the ability to execute such alternative financing plans may be subject to certain restrictions under the existing indebtedness. Any refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and may require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants compared to those associated with any debt that is being refinanced, which could further restrict the business operations. The inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy debt service obligations, or the inability to refinance debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects, consolidated financial condition, liquidity, consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\nThe failure to comply with the terms of our outstanding senior secured convertible notes could result in a default under the terms of the notes and, if uncured, it could potentially result in action against our pledged assets.\nThe Company issued $4.0 million of senior secured convertible notes to an accredited investor in November 2015 that is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets and those of the subsidiaries. In connection with the failure to timely file the 2015 Form 10-K, the 2016 March Form 10-Q, 2016 June Form 10-Q, and the 2016 September Form 10-Q, the Company has issued an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of its common stock in 2016 to Dominion.\nThe Company also issued convertible notes in the principal amount of \u00a33.7 million ($5.8 million at the date of issuance) in connection with the October 2015 acquisition of Betterware. The $4.0 million senior secured note matured on May 19, 2017 (and paid-in-full) and the \u00a33.7 million ($5.8 million at the date of issuance) in convertible notes issued matures in October 2018. The senior secured notes require, among other things, to maintain the security interest, make monthly installment payments, and meet various negative and affirmative covenants. The notes require the Company to maintain a listing on the NYSE American. If the Company is not able to do so or if the NYSE American commences the delisting process, the notes would be in default. If the Company fails to comply with the terms of the senior secured convertible note and/or the related agreements, the senior note holder could declare a note default and if the default were to remain uncured, the secured creditor would have the right to proceed against any or all of the collateral securing their note. In addition, in the event the Company fails to comply with the terms of the \u00a33.7 million ($5.8 million at the date of issuance) in convertible notes, the note holders also could declare a note default and if the default were to remain uncured, as a creditor they would have the right to proceed against the Company's assets subject to the first priority of secured creditors. Any action by the secured or unsecured creditors to proceed against the Company's assets would likely have a serious disruptive effect on the business operations. The Company last made its monthly payment, as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on the January 2017 principal portion.\nThe failure to comply with the terms of our operating and capital leases could result in a default under the terms of the lease and disruptions to our business which would likely harm our business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and stock price.\nThe Company utilizes capital leases, property leases, and equipment leases during the normal course of business. The property leases include the rent of facilities such as the Company's corporate headquarters, while the equipment leases mostly include office equipment and vehicles leases. If for any reason the Company would be deemed to be in breach of any of the agreements due to a lack of making timely payments that were agreed upon in the lease or for some other reason, the Company may suffer disruptions to the ordinary course of business which would likely harm the Company's business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and stock price. The Company may also receive a default notice under the terms of the lease which could trigger cross defaults with other debt held by the Company.\nOn March 14, 2017, Agel received an eviction notice on the Utah office lease. Agel vacated the premises on March 17, 2017. In addition, the Company is currently in default on the sale leaseback agreement described in Part II, Item 8, Note (12), Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. The sale leaseback agreement is a property lease for TLC's manufacturing, distribution, and retail store located in Frazeysburg, Ohio. If the landlord were to exercise its rights under the agreement, TLC would have to vacate the properties which would cause a significant disruption to the business and likely affect the Company's business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and stock price.\nWe may not have sufficient property, casualty, and workers compensation insurance to cover future claims.\nThe Company uses insurance to manage a limited number of risks. The Company is not fully insured on a number of risks such as damage or destruction of personal property and casualty liability, legal liability, professional liability, workers compensation liability, umbrella liability, cargo liability, product liability, and other liability. For those risks that are insured, the Company also faces the risk that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation. In addition, due the the limited insurance coverage maintained by the Company, the Company may not comply with mandated minimum insurance requirements set forth by local authorities in places of operation.\nIf a material claim were filed for any such liabilities not insured by the Company and judgment is entered against the Company, it is possible the Company may not have the financial resources to settle such claims.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). The stated growth strategy is to acquire companies, some of which may not have invested in or have adequate systems or financial and operational staffing to meet public company financial reporting standards. The Company reviews the financial reporting and other systems that each company\nhas. However, in many cases, the financial systems that are in place may not be as robust as needed. In addition, the Company lacks the infrastructure necessary to overcome the weaknesses. The Company cannot provide readers with assurance that the Company's accounting department has or will maintain adequate resources to ensure that the Company will not have any future material weaknesses in the Company's system of internal controls.\nThe Company has identified many material weaknesses in the overall control environment. The Company\u2019s extensive material weaknesses identified caused the Company to miss the filing dates of the periodic reports required by the SEC and NYSE American stock exchange listing requirements. Should the Company fail to maintain or implement adequate controls, readers could lose confidence in the reliability of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and in the accuracy of the periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act and the ability to obtain additional financing could be impaired. A lack of investor confidence in the reliability and accuracy of the public reporting could cause the Company's stock price to decline.\nThe Company has attempted to and will need to continue to thoroughly reevaluate the control environment and implement the appropriate remediation actions to have an effective control environment:\n\u2022\nThe Company will need to evaluate the existing accounting personnel and evaluate their abilities so the Company can hire the appropriate accounting personnel with the experience commensurate with maintaining an effective control environment required for a publicly traded company with international operations. The hiring of competent experienced accounting personnel is a challenge for the Company due to the Company's history of ongoing losses and the Company's budgeted resources in an ever pursuant cost reduction environment.\n\u2022\nThe Company needs to perform a risk assessment to identify all of the risks and address these risks with the appropriate processes and controls necessary to maintain an effective control environment.\n\u2022\nThe Company needs to implement processes and controls over the consolidation process.\n\u2022\nThe Company needs to implement reconciliation and review and approval processes over all material accounts in the financial statements.\n\u2022\nThe Company needs to implement processes and controls to ensure all inventory received is appropriately accounted for in the financial statements.\n\u2022\nThe Company needs to implement a reconciliation, review and approval process for all adjusting journal entries made to the Company\u2019s financial statements.\n\u2022\nThe Company needs to ensure there is sufficient accounting personnel to identify and resolve complex accounting issues. Conversely, the Company has experienced a high employee turnover in its accounting department and does not have sufficient resources to address these complex accounting issues.\n\u2022\nThe Company needs to develop processes and control activities that maintain the appropriate segregation of duties.\n\u2022\nThe Company needs to develop controls to ensure ERP system conversions are appropriately converted and all data is included in the new ERP system.\n\u2022\nThe Company needs to develop a plan over the segregation of cash controls.\n\u2022\nThe Company needs to develop the right processes, hire the right personnel, and implement the right control activities to ensure the Company is maintaining an effective control environment.\nThe Company has worked to develop a plan to address some of these weaknesses but cannot assure investors that capital will be available to implement such changes. There can be no assurances because of the Company's losses that funds will be available to invest in the remediation of these weaknesses.\nOur investments in marketable securities are subject to market risks, which may result in losses.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $389,000 and $5.3 million in marketable securities, respectively, invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of liquid bonds. At neither December 31, 2016 nor December 31, 2015 did the Company have any investments in equity securities. However, the Company has from time to time and may in the future invest in equity securities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks that could have a negative impact on the results of operations.\nOur business is difficult to evaluate because we have expanded within the last two years, and intend to continue to expand, our product offerings and customer base.\nDue to the Company's primary growth strategy of increasing revenue through acquisitions of other direct-to-consumer companies, and creating partnerships with companies that are engaged in business related to the direct-to-consumer industry, it may be difficult for readers to analyze the results of operations, identify historical trends, or even to make quarter-to-quarter comparisons because the Company has operated many of the acquired businesses for a relatively limited time and intend to continue to expand product\nofferings. The growth strategy, as well as each business acquired, is subject to many of the risks common to newly acquired enterprises, including the ability to implement a business plan, market acceptance of proposed products and services, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financing and other resources, competition from better funded and experienced companies, and the ability to generate profits. Considering the stage of the Company's development, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to consummate the business strategy and plans, as described herein, that the activities will be successful or that financial, technological, market, or other limitations will not force us to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of the plans.\nWe may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates and secure the necessary financing to close the transaction which may negatively impact our growth strategy.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition candidates or consummate future acquisitions or strategic transactions on acceptable terms. The failure to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate future acquisitions or strategic transactions on acceptable terms is likely to have an adverse effect on the prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and stock price as the primary growth strategy is based on increasing the acquisitions of, or entering into strategic transactions with direct selling companies, and potentially companies engaged in other direct-to-consumer related businesses. The Company is continually evaluating acquisition opportunities available that the Company believes will fit the acquisition strategy, namely companies that can increase the size and geographic scope of operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities.\nWe may seek to finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships which may dilute the interests of our shareholders.\nThe financing for future acquisitions could dilute the interests of shareholders, result in an increase in indebtedness, or both. The issuance of common stock in the offering completed in March 2015 (the \"Offering\") resulted in dilution to existing shareholders and the issuance of additional shares of common stock upon the exercise of any Warrants issued in the Offering will result in additional dilution to current shareholders. In addition, an acquisition, financing or other strategic transaction could adversely impact cash flows and/or operating results, and dilute shareholder interests, for a number of reasons. For example, the financing of the Betterware transaction and the senior secured convertible note that the Company issued in November 2015 each allow for the payment of certain obligations under such convertible note with shares of common stock which may dilute existing stockholders. Other reasons may include:\n\u2022\nInterest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition or new business venture; and\n\u2022\nAny issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or other strategic transaction which dilutes the current common stock holders.\nWe may be unsuccessful in integrating the business operations of our subsidiaries or any new businesses we acquire, which, if it were to occur, would negatively impact our growth strategy.\nIn the past, the Company's operations have been expanded via the acquisition of direct-selling businesses and engaging in the sale of new products through new distributors. The Company continues the process of integrating the operations of the entities acquired. There is a risk that the Company will be unable to successfully integrate the acquired businesses with the current management and structure. The Company is based in Dallas, Texas, and several of the businesses the Company acquired are based in other locations such as Europe, making the integration of newly acquired businesses challenging, including the generation of data required for the preparation and filing of the financial statements. The Company's estimates of capital, personnel and equipment required for the businesses are based on the historical experience of management and businesses they are familiar with.\nThe Company's primary growth strategy is based on increasing acquisitions of, or entering strategic transactions with direct selling companies, and potentially companies engaged in other direct selling related businesses. The failure to successfully complete the integration of the businesses acquired could have an adverse effect on prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and stock price. The integration of acquired entities may include the following challenges:\n\u2022\nAssimilating business operations, products and personnel with existing operations, products and personnel;\n\u2022\nEstimating the capital, personnel and equipment required for the acquired business based on the historical experience of management;\n\u2022\nMinimizing potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with other suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nSuccessfully developing and marketing the acquired entity\u2019s products and services;\n\u2022\nEntering a market in which the Company has limited prior experience; and\n\u2022\nCoordinating efforts throughout various distant localities and time zones where the acquired entities are based.\nThe growth strategy will be subject to many of the risks common to new enterprises, including the ability to implement a business plan, market acceptance of proposed products and services, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financing and other resources, competition from better funded and experienced companies, and the ability to generate profits. The Company can not make any assurance that the Company will be able to consummate the Company's business strategy and plans, that the Company's activities will be successful, or that the Company's financial, technological, market, or other limitations will not force the Company to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of the plans.\nThe diversion of management\u2019s attention and costs associated with acquisitions may have a negative impact on our business.\nIf management\u2019s attention is diverted from the management of the existing businesses as a result of its efforts in evaluating and negotiating new acquisitions and strategic transactions, the prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations of the existing businesses may suffer. The Company may also incur unanticipated costs in connection with pursuing acquisitions and strategic transactions.\nAcquisitions may subject us to additional unknown risks which may affect our customer retention and cause a reduction in our revenues.\nIn completing prior acquisitions and any future acquisitions, the Company has and will rely upon the representations and warranties and indemnities made by the sellers with respect to each such acquisition as well as the due diligence investigation. The Company cannot assure that such representations and warranties will be true and correct or that the due diligence will uncover all materially adverse facts relating to the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the acquired companies or their customers. To the extent that the Company is required to pay the debt obligations of an acquired company, or if material misrepresentations exist, the Company may not realize the expected benefit from such acquisition and the Company will have overpaid in cash and/or stock for the value received in that acquisition.\nWe may have difficulty managing future growth.\nSince the Company commenced operations in the direct-to-consumer business, the business has grown through the acquisition of revenue while the Company tries to stabilize the organic businesses. There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to John P. Rochon\u2019s and John Rochon, Jr.\u2019s ownership and control of the Company or that any conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to the other shareholders of the Company. On December 1, 2014, the Amended Share Exchange Agreement became effective, which limits Rochon Capital\u2019s right to be issued the Second Tranche Stock solely upon the occurrence of certain stock acquisitions by third parties or the announcement of certain tender or exchange offers of common stock.\nFurthermore, the issuance of the Second Tranche Stock in accordance with the terms of the Amended Share Exchange Agreement would have a further dilutive effect.\nAssuming the issuance of the Second Tranche Stock occurs, the number of outstanding shares of common stock would increase to in excess of 60,000,000, with approximately 190,000,000 shares of common stock available for issuance and John P. Rochon, together with John Rochon, Jr., would beneficially own approximately 75.9% of outstanding shares of common stock. In the event the Second Tranche Stock becomes issuable, 25,240,676 additional shares of common stock will be issued. The perception that such further dilution could occur may cause the market price of the common stock to decline.\nWe depend heavily on John P. Rochon and John Rochon, Jr., and we may be unable to find a suitable replacement for either of them if we were to lose their services.\nThe Company is heavily dependent upon John P. Rochon, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board and John Rochon, Jr., the Vice Chairman of the Board. The loss or unavailability of either of them could have a material adverse effect on the prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and stock price because of the unique industry experience and success they contribute to the Company.\nWe are dependent upon affiliated parties for the provisions of a substantial portion of our administrative services as we do not have the internal capabilities to provide such services, and many of our employees are also employees of such affiliated entities.\nThe Company utilizes the services of Richmont Holdings, Inc. (\"Richmont Holdings,\") a private investment and business management company owned 100% by John P. Rochon, under a reimbursement of services agreement pursuant to which Richmont Holdings provides transactions and consulting services. The Company has entered into an agreement with Richmont Holdings to reimburse Richmont Holdings for certain expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the access to certain of its personnel, financial analysis personnel, strategy assistance, marketing advice, taxation advice, and assorted other services related to day-to-day operations and the efforts to acquire and manage direct-to-consumer companies. The Company continues to rely upon Richmont Holdings for advice and assistance in areas related to identification, analysis, financing, due diligence, negotiations and other strategic planning, accounting, tax and legal matters associated with potential acquisitions. Richmont Holdings and its affiliates have experience in the above areas. There can be no assurance that the Company can successfully develop the necessary expertise and infrastructure without the assistance of these affiliated entities.\nOn October 18, 2017, the Company entered into a related party agreement with Rochon Capital Partners to provide short term funding of cash shortages arising in the ordinary course of business through October 31, 2018. This agreement is further discussed in Note (9), Related Party Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are dependent on their key personnel.\nThe loss of the key executive officers of certain subsidiaries would have a significant adverse effect on the operations of the affected subsidiary and its prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations. Although major decision making policies are handled by the Company\u2019s senior management, certain subsidiaries are primarily dependent upon their founder and/or Chief Executive Officer for their leadership roles with the respective sales forces. The Company has lost the services of several of these individuals from material subsidiaries in the past year. Readers should expect to see a reduction in resources associated with this change. The loss of additional individuals could have a negative impact on revenue and sale representative recruiting. The Company believes it is critical to retain certain key leaders of the acquired businesses, however there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in attracting and retaining the key personnel of an acquired business.\nDuring 2017, due to organizational restructuring, the Company\u2019s Vice Chairman of the Board, John Rochon Jr., began managing Agel and YIAH.\nOur failure to establish and maintain qualified representatives and sales leader relationships for any reason could negatively impact sales of our products and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company distributes products exclusively to and through independent sales representatives. The Company depends upon them directly for substantially all of the Company's revenue. The independent sales representatives, including the sales leaders, may voluntarily terminate their representative agreements with the Company at any time. In general, to increase the revenue of a Company in this industry, the Company must increase the number of, or the productivity of, the independent sales representatives. Accordingly, the success of the Company depends in significant part upon the ability to recruit, retain and motivate a large base of independent sales representatives. The loss of a significant number of independent sales representatives for any reason could negatively impact the Company's product sales and could impair the Company's ability to attract new independent sales representatives. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the number of independent sales representatives decreased from 63,000 to 46,000 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The revenue was significantly impacted as a result of this decline in the number of independent sales representatives In the Company's efforts to attract and retain independent sales representatives, the Company competes with other network marketing organizations, including those in the \"gourmet food,\" \"nutritional and wellness,\" \"home d\u00e9cor\" product industries. The Company's operating results could be harmed if existing and new business opportunities and products do not generate sufficient interest to retain existing and attract new independent sales representatives.\nThe Company has a high turnover rate of independent sales representatives, which is a common characteristic found in the direct selling industry. The contracts signed by the Company's independent sales representatives enable them to terminate their service at any time.\nThe ability to remain competitive and maintain and expand the business depends, in significant part, on the success of the subsidiaries in recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing their independent sales representatives through an appropriate compensation plan, the maintenance of an attractive product portfolio and other incentives, and innovating the direct-to-consumer model. The Company cannot ensure that the strategies for soliciting and retaining the representatives of the subsidiaries or any direct-to-consumer company acquired in the future will be successful, and if they are not, the Company's prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and stock price could be negatively affected.\nSeveral factors affect the ability to attract and retain independent sales representatives, including:\n\u2022\nOn-going motivation of independent sales representatives;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nSignificant changes in the amount of commissions paid;\n\u2022\nPublic perception and acceptance of the industry, business and products;\n\u2022\nAbility to provide proprietary quality-driven products that the market demands;\n\u2022\nCompetition in recruiting and retaining independent sales representatives; and\n\u2022\nPublic perception of the Company.\nChanges to our compensation arrangements could be viewed negatively by some independent sales representatives and could cause failure to achieve desired long-term results and increases in commissions paid could have a negative impact on profitability.\nThe payment of commissions and incentives, including bonuses and prizes, is one of the Company's most significant expenses. The Company closely monitors the amount of the commissions and incentives paid as a percentage of net revenues, and may periodically adjust the compensation plan to better manage these costs.\nThe Company may modify components of the compensation plans from time to time in an attempt to remain competitive and attractive to existing and potential independent sales representatives including modifications to:\n\u2022\nAddress changing market dynamics;\n\u2022\nProvide incentives to independent sales representatives that are intended to help grow the business;\n\u2022\nConform to local regulations; and\n\u2022\nAddress other business needs.\nBecause of the size of the sales force and the complexity of the compensation plans, it is difficult to predict how independent sales representatives will view such changes and whether such changes will achieve their desired results. Furthermore, any downward adjustments to commissions and incentives may make it difficult to attract and retain independent sales representatives or cause us to lose some of the existing independent sales representatives. There can be no assurance that changes to the compensation plans will be successful in achieving target levels of commissions and incentives as a percentage of net revenues and preventing these costs from having a significant adverse effect on earnings.\nOur business operates in an industry with intense competition.\nThe business operates in an industry with numerous manufacturers, distributors and retailers of consumer goods. The market for products is intensely competitive. Many competitors, such as Avon Products Inc., Tupperware Brands Corp. and others are significantly larger, have greater financial resources, and have more name recognition. The Company relies on the independent sales representatives to market and sell the products through direct marketing techniques. The ability to compete with other direct marketing companies depends greatly on the ability to attract and retain qualified independent sales representatives. In addition, the Company currently does not have significant patent or other proprietary protection, and competitors may introduce products with the same or similar ingredients. As a result, the Company may have difficulty differentiating products from competitors\u2019 products and other competing products that enter the market. There can be no assurance that future operations would not be harmed as a result of changing market conditions and future competition.\nWe and our subsidiaries generally conduct business in one channel.\nThe principal business is conducted worldwide in one channel, the direct-to-consumer channel. Products and services of direct-to-consumer companies are sold to retail consumers. Spending by retail consumers is affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, gasoline prices, labor strikes and consumer confidence, all of which are beyond the Company's control. The Company may face economic challenges because customers may continue to have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit and falling home prices, among other things.\nChanges in consumer purchasing habits, including reducing purchases of a direct-to-consumer company\u2019s products, or reducing purchases from representatives or buying products in channels other than direct-to-consumer, such as retail, could reduce the Company's sales, impact the ability to execute the business strategy or have a material adverse effect on the prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nDirect selling companies are subject to numerous laws.\nThe direct-to-consumer industry is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the Federal Trade Commission and various state agencies in the United States, as well as regulations regarding direct-to-consumer activities in foreign markets. Laws specifically applicable to direct-to-consumer companies generally are directed at preventing deceptive or misleading marketing and sales practices, and include laws often referred to as \"pyramid\" or \"chain sales\" scheme laws. These \"anti-pyramid\" laws are focused on ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to end consumers and that advancement within a sales organization is based on sales of products and services rather than investments in the organization, recruiting other participants, or other non-retail sales-related criteria. The regulatory requirements concerning direct-to-consumer programs involve a high level of subjectivity and are subject to judicial interpretation. The Company is subject to the risk that these laws or regulations or the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by governmental agencies or courts can change. Any direct-to-consumer company that is owned or acquired in the future, could be found not to be in compliance with current or newly adopted laws or regulations in one or more markets, which could prevent us from conducting business in these markets and harm the Company's prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and stock price. The Company's is aware of pending judicial actions and investigations against other companies in the direct-to-consumer industry. Adverse decisions in these cases could impact the business if direct-to-consumer laws or anti-pyramid laws are interpreted more narrowly or in a manner that results in additional burdens or restrictions on direct selling. The implementation of such regulations may be influenced by public attention directed toward a direct-to-consumer company, its products or its direct-to-consumer program, such that extensive adverse publicity could result in increased regulatory scrutiny. If any government were to ban or restrict the business model, the Company's prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to numerous government regulations.\nProducts and related promotional and marketing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation by numerous governmental agencies and authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration, the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Agriculture, State Attorney Generals and other state regulatory agencies in the United States, and similar government agencies in each market in which the Company operates. Government authorities regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy and benefits of the products. These regulatory authorities typically require adequate and reliable scientific substantiation to support any marketing claims. What constitutes such reliable scientific substantiation can vary widely from market to market and there is no assurance that the research and development efforts undertaken to support the Company's claims will be deemed adequate for any particular product or claim. If the Company is unable to show adequate and reliable scientific substantiation for product claims, or marketing materials, or the claims of the sales force that exceed the scope of allowed claims for nutritional supplements, spices, or skin care products, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities could take enforcement action which could harm the business by requiring a revision of marketing materials, amendment of claims, or stoppage of product sales.\nFor example, the FDA recently issued warning letters to several cosmetic companies alleging improper structure/function claims regarding their cosmetic products, including, for example, product claims regarding gene activity, cellular rejuvenation, and rebuilding collagen. There is a degree of subjectivity in determining whether a claim is an improper structure/function claim. Given this subjectivity and the research and development focus on skin care products and dietary supplements, there is a risk that the Company could receive a warning letter, be required to modify product claims or take other actions to satisfy the FDA if the FDA determines any marketing materials include improper structure/function claims for cosmetic products. In addition, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have filed class action lawsuits against some competitors after the competitors received these FDA warning letters. There can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to governmental actions or class action lawsuits, which could harm the business.\nThere are an increasing number of laws and regulations being promulgated by the U.S. government, governments of individual states and governments overseas that pertain to the Internet and doing business online. In addition, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal, state, local, and foreign governments and agencies.\nAs a U.S. entity operating through subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions, the Company is subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and customs laws that regulate the flow of funds between the Company and subsidiaries and for product purchases, management services and contractual obligations, such as the payment of sales commissions.\nThe failure of the representatives of our subsidiaries to comply with laws, regulations and court decisions creates potential exposure for regulatory action or lawsuits against us.\nBecause the representatives that market and sell products and services are independent contractors, and not employees, the Company has limited control over their actions. In the United States, the direct-to-consumer industry and regulatory authorities have generally relied on the implementation of a company\u2019s rules and policies governing its direct-to-consumer sales field, designed to promote retail sales, protect consumers, prevent inappropriate activities and distinguish between legitimate direct-to-consumer plans and unlawful pyramid schemes, to compel compliance with applicable laws. The Company maintains compliance measures to identify specific complaints against representatives and to remedy any violations through appropriate sanctions, including warnings, suspensions and, when necessary, terminations. Because of the significant number of representatives' subsidiaries have, it is not feasible for the subsidiaries to monitor the representatives\u2019 day-to-day business activities. The Company must maintain the \"independent contractor\" status of representatives and, therefore, have limited control over their business activities. As a result, the Company cannot insure that the representatives will comply with all applicable rules and regulations, domestically or globally. Violations by the representatives of applicable laws or of the policies and procedures in dealing with customers could reflect negatively on the Company's prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations, including the business reputation, and could subject the Company to fines and penalties. In addition, it is possible that a court could hold the Company civilly or criminally accountable based on vicarious liability because of the actions of the representatives.\nAlthough the physical labeling of products is not within the control of the representatives, the representatives must nevertheless advertise the products in compliance with the extensive regulations that exist in certain jurisdictions, such as the United States, which considers product advertising to be labeling for regulatory purposes.\nFoods, nutritional supplements and skin care products are subject to rigorous FDA and related legal regimens limiting the types of therapeutic claims that can be made about the products. The treatment or cure of disease, for example, is not a permitted claim for these products. While the Company trains the independent sales representatives and attempts to monitor the sales representatives\u2019 marketing materials, the Company cannot ensure that all such materials comply with applicable regulations, including bans on therapeutic claims. If the Company's independent sales representatives fail to comply with these restrictions, then the Company and the independent sales representatives could be subjected to claims, financial penalties, mandatory product recalls or relabeling requirements, which could harm the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Although the Company expects that responsibility for the actions of the independent sales representatives in such an instance would be dependent on a determination that the Company either controlled or condoned a non-compliant advertising practice, there can be no assurance that the Company could not be held vicariously liable for the actions of the independent sales representatives.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s vote to exit from the European Union could adversely impact us.\nOn June 23, 2016, in a referendum vote commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d a majority of British voters voted to exit the European Union. Following the referendum, it is expected that the British government will initiate negotiations with the European Union to determine the terms of the U.K.\u2019s exit. A withdrawal could potentially disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the European Union, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the European Union or other nations as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European Union or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. It is unclear what long-term economic, financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union would have and how such withdrawal would affect the Company's business globally and in the region. In addition, Brexit may lead other European Union member countries to consider referendums regarding their European Union membership. Any of these events, along with any political, economic and regulatory changes that may occur, could cause political and economic uncertainty in Europe and internationally and harm the Company's business and financial results.\nOur operations could be harmed if we are found not to be in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices.\nIn the United States, FDA regulations on \"Good Manufacturing Practices\" and \"Adverse Event Reporting\" requirements for the nutritional supplement industry require the Company and suppliers to maintain good manufacturing processes, including stringent supplier qualifications, ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping. The ingredient identification requirement, which requires the Company to confirm the levels, identity and potency of ingredients listed on the product labels within a narrow range, is particularly burdensome and difficult for the Company with respect to the cosmetic products which contains many different ingredients. The Company is also required to report serious adverse events associated with consumer use of products. The Company operations could be harmed if regulatory authorities make determinations that the Company, or suppliers, are not in compliance with these regulations or public reporting of adverse events harms the reputation for quality and safety. A\nfinding of noncompliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties or actions impacting the ability to continue selling certain products. In addition, compliance with these regulations has increased and may further increase the cost of manufacturing certain products as the Company works with the suppliers to assure they are qualified and in compliance.\nFurthermore, the Company is self-insured with respect to product liability claims. If a material claim were filed and judgment is entered against the Company, it is possible the Company may not have the financial resources to settle such claims.\nAdverse publicity associated with our products, ingredients or network marketing program, or those of similar companies could harm our prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nThe number of representatives and the results of operations may be affected significantly by the publics' perception of the Company and its subsidiaries and of similar companies. This perception is dependent upon opinions concerning:\n\u2022\nThe safety and quality of products, components and ingredients, as applicable;\n\u2022\nThe safety and quality of similar products, components and ingredients, as applicable, distributed by other companies\u2019 representatives;\n\u2022\nMarketing program;\n\u2022\nThe business of direct-to-consumer companies generally;\n\u2022\nThe financial condition of the Company; and\n\u2022\nIndustry discussion regarding the Company's commission and incentive plans.\nAdverse publicity concerning any actual or purported failure of the subsidiaries or of their representatives to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding product claims and advertising, good manufacturing practices, the regulation of the marketing program, the licensing of the products for sale in target markets or other aspects of the business, whether or not resulting in enforcement actions or the imposition of penalties, could have an adverse effect on the goodwill and could negatively affect the ability to attract, motivate and retain representatives, which would negatively impact the ability to generate revenue.\nIf we are unable to develop and introduce new products that gain acceptance from our customers and representatives, our business could be harmed.\nThe Company's continued success depends on the ability to anticipate, evaluate, and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences. The Company must continually work to discover and market new products, maintain and enhance the recognition of the brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, and refine the approach as to how and where products are marketed and sold. A critical component of the business is the ability to develop new products that create enthusiasm among the independent sales representatives and ultimate customers. If the Company is unable to introduce new products, the independent sales representatives\u2019 productivity could be harmed. In addition, if any new products fail to gain market acceptance, are restricted by regulatory requirements or have quality problems, this would harm the results of operations. Factors that could affect the ability to continue to introduce new products include, among others, government regulations, the inability to attract and retain qualified research and development staff, the termination of third-party research and collaborative arrangements, proprietary protections of competitors that may limit the ability to offer comparable products, and the difficulties in anticipating changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences.\nA general economic downturn, a recession globally or in one or more of our geographic regions or other challenges may adversely affect our business and our access to liquidity and capital.\nA downturn in the economies in which products are sold, including any recession in one or more of the geographic regions, or the current global macro-economic pressures, could adversely affect the business and the Company's access to liquidity and capital. The Company could experience a decline in revenues, profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by economic or operational challenges. Any or all of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources, including the ability to raise additional capital and maintain credit lines and offshore cash balances.\nConsumer spending is also generally affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, gasoline prices and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond the Company's control. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, such as beauty and related products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of products. The Company could face continued economic challenges in the current fiscal\nyear if customers continue to have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit or sharply falling home prices, among other things.\nNutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies.\nSome of the nutritional supplements the Company offers are made from vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption. Other nutritional supplements offered contain innovative ingredients. Although the Company believes that all of the products are safe when taken as directed, there is little long-term experience with human consumption of certain of these ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form. The Company conducts research and tests the formulation and production of products, but the Company has not performed or sponsored any clinical studies. Furthermore, because the Company is highly dependent on consumers\u2019 perception of the efficacy, safety, and quality of the products, as well as similar products distributed by other companies, the Company could be adversely affected in the event that these products prove or are asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with any illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers\u2019 use or misuse of the products or similar products of competitors.\nWe frequently rely on outside suppliers and manufacturers, and if those suppliers and manufactures fail to supply products in sufficient quantities and in a timely fashion, our business could suffer.\nThe Company depends on outside suppliers for raw materials and finished goods. The Company may also use outside manufacturers to make all or part of the products. Profit margins and timely product delivery may be dependent upon the ability of outside suppliers and manufacturers to supply products in a timely and cost-efficient manner. The contract manufacturers acquire all of the raw materials for manufacturing products from third-party suppliers. The Company does not believe that it's materially dependent on any single supplier for raw materials or finished goods. However, in the event of a loss of multiple suppliers and experience delays in identifying or transitioning to alternative suppliers, the Company could experience product shortages or product back orders, which could harm the business. There can be no assurance that suppliers will be able to provide the contract manufacturers the raw materials or finished goods in the quantities and at the appropriate level of quality that are requested or at a price that the Company is willing to pay. The Company is also subject to delays caused by any interruption in the production of these materials including weather, crop conditions, climate change, transportation interruptions and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The Company's ability to enter new markets and sustain satisfactory levels of sales in each market may depend on the ability of outside suppliers and manufacturers to provide required levels of ingredients and products and to comply with all applicable regulations.\nThe Company is dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the manufacturers and suppliers of products. Those operations are subject to power failures, the breakdown, failure, or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural or other disasters, and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies, including the FDA. There can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at the facilities would not have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations and/ or financial condition.\nDisruptions to transportation channels that we use to distribute our products to international warehouses may adversely affect our margins and profitability in those markets.\nThe Company may experience disruptions to the transportation channels used to distribute products, including increased airport and shipping port congestion, a lack of transportation capacity, increased fuel expenses, and a shortage of manpower. Disruptions in the container shipments may result in increased costs, including the additional use of airfreight to meet demand. Although the Company has not recently experienced significant shipping disruptions, the Company continues to watch for signs of upcoming congestion. Congestion to ports can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies, resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs and reduction in profitability.\nA failure of our information technology systems would harm our business.\nThe Company's IT systems are vulnerable to a variety of potential risks, including damage or interruption resulting from natural disasters, telecommunication failures, and human error or intentional acts of sabotage, vandalism, break-ins and similar acts. Although the Company has started to develop a business continuity and disaster recovery plan, which includes routine back-up, off-site archiving and storage, and certain redundancies, the occurrence of any of these events could result in costly interruptions or failures adversely affecting the business and the results of operations. The Company recently implemented an internally developed back office system at the Longaberger Company. If this system does not provide similar functionality to that of which the old system provided, the Company could incur additional losses due to distribution issues and other related problems.\nOur business is subject to on-line security risks, including security breaches.\nThe businesses involve the storage and transmission of users\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose the Company to a risk of loss or misuse of information, litigation, and potential liability. An increasing number of websites, including those of several large companies, have recently disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their sites. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A party that is able to circumvent the security measures could misappropriate the Company's or the customers\u2019 proprietary information, cause interruption in operations, damage computers or those of customers, or otherwise damage reputation and business. Any compromise of security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to reputation, and a loss of confidence in security measures, which could harm the business.\nThe Company's servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, \"denial-of-service\" type attacks and similar disruptions that could, in certain instances, make all or portions of the websites unavailable for periods of time. The Company may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. These issues are likely to become more difficult as the number of places the Company operates increases. Security breaches, including any breach of the Company or of parties with which have commercial relationships with the Company that result in the unauthorized release of users\u2019 personal information, could damage the reputation and expose the Company to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Insurance policies carry coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse the Company for losses caused by security breaches.\nFurthermore, data protection in domestic and international markets is governed by local, state, and federal laws that require compliance with each of these laws. Material penalties for each compliance issue of such laws, may be levied against the Company. The Company believes its data protection policies are robust, however, there can be no assurance the Company is in full compliance with each regulation.\nOur ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks. In addition, taxation and transfer pricing could affect our operations and we as a result we could be subjected to additional taxes, duties, interest, and penalties in material amounts, which could harm our business.\nThe ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in the existing international markets is exposed to risks associated with international operations, including:\n\u2022\nThe possibility that a foreign government might ban or severely restrict the business method of direct selling, or that local civil unrest, political instability or changes in diplomatic or trade relationships might disrupt the operations in an international market;\n\u2022\nThe lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas where the Company operates;\n\u2022\nThe presence of high inflation in the economies of international markets in which the Company operates;\n\u2022\nThe possibility that a government authority might impose legal, tax or other financial burdens on the Company or independent sales representatives, due, for example, to the structure of operations in various markets;\n\u2022\nThe possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of the independent sales representatives as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on the independent sales representatives;\n\u2022\nThe possibility that governments may impose currency remittance restrictions limiting the ability to repatriate cash;\n\u2022\nThe possibility that the governments may suspend the license to sell product in certain markets due to the non-payment of tax such as sales tax and value added tax; and\n\u2022\nChallenges to transfer prices established by the Company.\nAs a multinational corporation, operating in many countries, including the United States, the Company is subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that the inter-company transactions are consummated at prices that have not been manipulated to produce a desired tax result, that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by the local entities, and that the Company is taxed appropriately on such transactions. In addition, the Company's operations are subject to regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of customs duties are assessed on the importation of products.\nRegulators closely monitor the corporate structure, inter-company transactions, and how inter-company fund transfers effectuate. If regulators challenge the corporate structure, transfer pricing methodologies or inter-company transfers, operations may be harmed and the Company's effective tax rate may increase. A change in applicable tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in a higher effective tax rate on the worldwide earnings and such change could be significant to the financial results. In the\nevent any audit or assessments are concluded adversely to the Company, these matters could have a material impact on the consolidated financial condition.\nThe Company is currently subject to pending or proposed audits that are at various levels of review, assessment, or appeal in a number of jurisdictions involving transfer pricing issues, income taxes, customs duties, value added taxes, withholding taxes, sales and use and other taxes and related interest and penalties in material amounts. In some circumstances, additional taxes, interest and penalties have been assessed and the Company will be required to pay the assessments or post surety, in order to challenge the assessments.\nWe are not current on the remittance of collected sales and use tax and VAT tax.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company is not current on sales and use tax remittance in the United States and VAT tax remittance in foreign markets. As a result, local tax authorities may at any time take the necessary steps to collected, in full, all tax collected that was not remitted, interest on the tax collected, and penalties, warranted by failing to timely remit the tax collect. In addition the local regulatory authorities may place a lien against the Company; and limit the ability to operate in the jurisdictions with unpaid tax. The regulatory authorities may collect the taxes by levying deductions against the Company's bank accounts. If the regulatory authorities use this method to collect taxes, the Company may have greater difficulty managing cash which may have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial condition.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce our overall profits.\nIn 2016, 80.4% of revenues were derived from markets outside of the United States. In 2015, 71.0% of revenues were derived from markets outside of the United States. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, certain financial information is required to be translated from foreign currencies to the United States dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted-average exchange rate. If the United States dollar changes relative to applicable local currencies, there is a risk the reported sales, operating expenses, and net income could significantly fluctuate. The Company is not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations; nor can the Company estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon future operations. To date, the Company has not entered into any hedging contracts or participated in any hedging or derivative activities. Therefore, the Company has material exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.\nNon-compliance with anti-corruption laws could harm our business.\nInternational operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"). Any allegations that the Company is not in compliance with anti-corruption laws may require the Company to dedicate time and resources to an internal investigation of the allegations or may result in a government investigation. Any determination that the Company's operations or activities are not in compliance with existing anti-corruption laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, and other penalties. Although the Company has implemented anti-corruption policies, controls and training globally to protect against violation of these laws, the Company cannot be certain that these efforts will be effective. In the past, competitors have been under investigation in the United States for allegations that its employees violated the FCPA in China and other markets. If this investigation causes adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of the industry, the business could be harmed.\nWe may own, obtain or license intellectual property material to our business, and our ability to compete may be adversely affected by the loss of rights to use that intellectual property.\nThe market for products may depend significantly upon the value associated with product innovations and brand equity. Many direct sellers own, obtain or license material patents and trademarks used in connection with the marketing and distribution of their products. Those companies must expend time and resources in developing their intellectual property and pursuing any infringement of that intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect a company\u2019s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect a company\u2019s patents and trademarks may be substantial.\nChallenges by private parties to the direct selling system could harm our business.\nDirect-to-consumer companies have historically been subject to legal challenges regarding their method of operation or other elements of their business by private parties, including their own representatives, in individual lawsuits and through class actions, including lawsuits claiming the operation of illegal pyramid schemes that reward recruiting over sales. No assurance can be provided\nthat the Company would not be harmed if any such actions were brought against any of the current subsidiaries or any other direct selling company acquired in the future.\nAs a direct selling company, we may face product liability claims and could incur damages and expenses, which could affect our prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nAs a direct-to-consumer company, the Company may face financial liability from product liability claims if the use of products results in significant loss or injury. A substantial product liability claim could exceed the amount of insurance coverage or could be excluded under the terms of an existing insurance policy, which could adversely affect the prospects, business activities, consolidated cash flow, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nSelling products for human consumption such as nutritional supplements and spices as well as the sale of skin care products involve a number of risks. The Company may need to recall some of products if they become contaminated, are tampered with or are mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in adverse publicity, damage to the reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the products, which could have a material adverse effect on the business results and the value of the brands. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding products could adversely affect the Company's reputation and brand image.\nFurthermore, the Company is self-insured with respect to product liability claims. If a material claim were filed and judgment is entered against the Company, it is possible the Company may not have the financial resources to settle such claims.\nIf we fail to protect our trademarks and tradenames, then our ability to compete could be negatively affected, which would harm our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market for products depends upon the goodwill associated with the trademarks and trade names. The Company owns, or has licenses to use, the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of the products in the majority of the markets where those products are sold. Therefore, trademark and trade name protection is important to the business. Although most of the trademarks are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries in which operations occur, the Company may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The loss or infringement of trademarks or trade names could impair the goodwill associated with the brands and harm the reputation, which would harm the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company permits the limited use of the trademarks by independent sales representatives to assist them in the marketing of the products. It is possible that doing so may increase the risk of unauthorized use or misuse of the trademarks in markets where their registration status differs from that asserted by the independent sales representatives, or they may be used in association with claims or products in a manner not permitted under applicable laws and regulations. Were this to occur, it is possible that this could diminish the value of these marks or otherwise impair the further use of these marks.\nOur business is subject to intellectual property risks.\nNone of the Company's products are protected by patents. Restrictive regulations governing the precise labeling of ingredients and percentages for nutritional supplements, the large number of manufacturers that produce products with many active ingredients in common and the rapid change and frequent reformulation of products make patent protection impractical. As a result, the Company enters into confidentiality agreements with certain employees in research and development activities, independent sales representatives, suppliers, directors, officers, and consultants to help protect the intellectual property, investment in research and development activities, and trade secrets. There can be no assurance that the Company's efforts to protect intellectual property and trademarks will be successful, nor can there be any assurance that third parties will not assert claims against the Company for infringement of intellectual property rights, which could result in the business being required to obtain licenses for such rights, to pay royalties or to terminate manufacturing of infringing products, all of which could have a material negative impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our independent sales representatives, which could harm our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nThe independent sales representatives are subject to taxation and, in some instances, legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on the Company to collect taxes, such as value added taxes, and to maintain appropriate tax records. In addition, the\nCompany is subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to the independent sales representatives. In the event that local laws and regulations require the Company to treat the independent sales representatives as employees, or if the independent sales representatives are deemed by local regulatory authorities to be employees, rather than independent contractors, the Company may be held responsible for social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions, plus any related assessments and penalties, which could harm the consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nSeveral of our directors and officers have other business interests.\nSeveral directors have other business interests, including Mr. Rochon, who controls Richmont Holdings. Those other interests may come into conflict with the Company's interests and the interests of the shareholders. Mr. Rochon and several of the other directors serve on the boards of directors of several other private companies and, as a result of their business experience, may be asked to serve on the boards of other companies. The Company may compete with these other business interests for such directors\u2019 time and efforts.\nThe Company's officers may also work for Richmont Holdings or its affiliated entities. These employees have discretion to decide what time they devote to the Company's activities, which may result in a lack of availability when needed due to their other responsibilities.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets is possible, depending upon future operating results and the value of our common stock.\nThe Company tested goodwill and intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year and will do so in future fiscal years, and on an interim basis, if indicators of impairment exist. Factors which influence the evaluation of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include the price of the common stock and expected future operating results. If the carrying value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is no longer deemed to be recoverable, the Company could potentially incur material impairment charges. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $6.7 million as a result of this testing. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $192,000. Although the Company believes these charges are non-cash in nature and do not affect the operations or cash flow, these charges reduce stockholders\u2019 equity and reported results of operations in the period charged and will impact the shareholders' equity required to be in compliance with the NYSE American regulations.\nThere currently is a limited liquid trading market for our common stock and we cannot assure investors that a robust trading market will ever develop or be sustained.\nTo date there has been a limited trading market for the common stock on the NYSE American. The Company cannot predict how liquid the market for the common stock may become. The Company believes the listing of the common stock on the NYSE American is beneficial to the Company and the shareholders. However, while the Company believes that the NYSE MKT listing has improved the liquidity of the common stock, reduced trading volume and increased volatility may affect the share price. A lack of an active market may impair investors\u2019 ability to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price they consider reasonable. The lack of an active trading market may impair the Company's ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair the ability to acquire other companies by using common stock as consideration.\nMarket prices for the common stock will be influenced by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nThe issuance of new equity securities, including issuances of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nThe introduction of new products or services by the Company or competitors;\n\u2022\nThe acquisition of new direct selling businesses;\n\u2022\nChanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nSignificant dilution caused by the anti-dilutive clauses in financial agreements;\n\u2022\nCompetitive developments, including announcements by competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nVariations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nChange in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nA limited amount of news and analyst coverage for the company;\n\u2022\nThe depth and liquidity of the market for the shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nSales of large blocks of common stock, including sales by Rochon Capital, any executive officers or directors appointed in the future, or by other significant shareholders;\n\u2022\nInvestor perceptions of the company and the direct selling segment generally; and\n\u2022\nGeneral economic and other national and international conditions.\nOur common stock may not always be considered a \"covered security\".\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \"covered securities.\" Because the common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, the Company's common stock is a covered security. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case.\nComplying with federal securities laws as a publicly traded company is expensive. Any deficiencies in our financial reporting internal controls and the lack of attracting sufficiently experience accountants could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, our ability to issue shares in acquisitions, and our trading price of common stock.\nCompanies listed on the NYSE American must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and must be current in their reports under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, in order to maintain the listing on NYSE American. The Exchange Act requires that reporting issuers file quarterly and annual reports containing financial statements with the SEC. The Company failed to timely file its 2015 Form 10-K, March Form 10-Q, June Form 10-Q, and September Form 10-Q. The Company may, from time to time, again experience difficulties in meeting the SEC\u2019s reporting requirements. The recent failure and any future failure by the Company to timely file periodic reports with the SEC could harm the Company's reputation, negatively impact the Company's consolidated financial condition, the trading price of the common stock and the Company's ability to issue shares in acquisitions. The failure to timely file with the SEC the 2015 Form 10-K, the March Form 10-Q, the June Form 10-Q, and the September Form 10-Q is an event of default under the senior secured note with Dominion. Dominion agreed to waive each such event of default provided that the Company issues Dominion 50,000 shares of common stock for each ten (10) business days that each filing is late. In addition, Dominion has provided a waiver such that the failure to comply with any other covenant set forth in Section 14 of the Note would not constitute an event of default under the Note, and that any further notice to Dominion under the Note in respect of the same would not be required; provided that the Company issues to Dominion 100,000 shares of its common stock; provided that such waiver shall not apply to any compliance failures that occur after January 1, 2017. The Company has cured the default with respect to the untimely filing of the 2015 Form 10-K, the filing of the March Form 10-Q, the filing of the June Form 10-Q, and the filing of the September Form 10-Q. The failure to timely file has resulted in the Company's inability to remain S-3 eligible resulting, among other things, in the failure to meet the conditions that would require a cash exercise of the Warrants issued in the recent Offering. The Company will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses related to compliance with applicable securities laws. Failure to comply with the responsibilities thereunder could cause sanctions or other actions to be taken by the SEC against the Company.\nThe limited trading volume of our common stock may cause volatility in our share price.\nThe Company's stock has in the past been thinly traded due to the limited number of shares available for trading on the NYSE American thus causing potential large swings in price. As such, investors and potential investors may find it difficult to resell their securities at or near the original purchase price or at any price. If the stock experiences volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid per share. Sales of substantial amounts of the common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of the common stock and the stock price may decline substantially in a short period of time. As a result, shareholders could suffer losses or be unable to liquidate their holdings.\nMarket price fluctuations may negatively affect the ability of investors to sell shares at consistent prices.\nSales of our common stock under Rule 144 could impact the price of our common stock.\nIn general, under Rule 144 (\"Rule 144,\") as promulgated under the Securities Act, persons holding restricted securities in an SEC reporting company, including affiliates, must hold their shares for a period of at least six months, may not sell more than 1% of the total issued and outstanding shares in any 90-day period and must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price. Whenever a substantial number of shares of common stock become available for resale under Rule 144, the market price for the common stock will likely be impacted. However, the Company's prior history as a shell company requires that we are current in our SEC filings in order for investors to resell stock under Rule 144. During 2015 and 2016, the Company has not timely filed SEC filings and at this time the Company is not current in SEC filings.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our common stock price and trading volume.\nSecurities research analysts, including those affiliated with the underwriters, establish and publish their own periodic projections for the business. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results the Company actually achieves. The stock price may decline if the actual results do not match securities research analysts\u2019 projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who writes reports on the Company downgrades the stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about the business or if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the company or fails to publish reports on the Company regularly, the Company's stock price or trading volume could decline. While the Company expects securities research analyst coverage, if no securities or industry analysts begin to cover the Company, the trading price for the stock and the trading volume could be adversely affected.\nClass action litigation due to stock price volatility or other factors could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIt is not uncommon for securities class action litigation to be brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of such company\u2019s securities. Companies in certain industries are particularly vulnerable to this kind of litigation due to the high volatility of their stock prices. The Company's common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past. This may be a result of, among other things, variations in the Company's results of operations and announcements by the Company and competitors, as well as general economic conditions. The stock price may continue to experience substantial volatility. Accordingly, the Company may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of management.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future, which will reduce investors\u2019 ownership percentage in our outstanding securities and will dilute our share value.\nIf future operations or acquisitions are financed through issuing equity securities or if existing indebtedness is paid with, exchanged with, or restructured with equity securities, shareholders could experience significant dilution. The issuance of common stock in a public offering was consummated in March 2015 resulted in dilution to existing shareholders and the issuance of additional shares of common stock and/or Warrants pursuant to the Underwriters\u2019 over-allotment option as well as the exercise of any Warrants issued in the March 2015 offering will result in additional dilution to current shareholders. In addition, the conversion of the convertible notes issued in the Betterware transaction in October 2015 and the debt financing that was consummated in November 2015, will result in additional dilution to shareholders. The securities issued in the November 2015 debt financing have rights and preferences that are senior to rights of the common stock and the Company may in the future issue securities in connection with future financing activities or potential acquisitions that may have rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of the common stock. The issuance of shares of the common stock upon the exercise of options, which the Company may grant in the future, may result in dilution to the shareholders. In addition, the issuance of securities in lieu of payments of outstanding debt will also have a dilutive effect. The Company may issue preferred stock that may have rights and preferences that are superior to the rights of the common stock. The Company's articles of incorporation currently authorize the Company to issue 250,000,000 shares of common stock. Assuming the issuance of the Second Tranche Stock (which shares may only be issued under certain limited circumstances, as described above), the number of outstanding shares of common stock would increase to in excess of 60,000,000 with approximately 190,000,000 shares of common stock available for issuance. The future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of common stock held by then existing shareholders. The Company may issue common stock in the future, including for services or acquisitions or other corporate actions that may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by the shareholders, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for the common stock.\nWe have not paid and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock.\nThe Company has not paid any dividends on common stock to date and it is not anticipated that any dividends will be paid to holders of the common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, certain of the Company's outstanding loans prohibit the payment of dividends while the loans are outstanding. While the Company's future dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the businesses, it is currently anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance the future expansion and for the implementation of the business strategy. The shareholders will not realize a return on their investment in the Company unless and until they sell shares after the trading price of the common stock appreciates from the price at which a shareholder purchased shares of the common stock. As an investor, readers should consider that a lack of a dividend can further affect the market value of the common stock and could significantly affect the value of any investment in the Company.\nOur articles of incorporation, bylaws and Florida law have anti-takeover provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nThe Company's articles of incorporation, bylaws and Florida law contain provisions which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to the shareholders. The Company is authorized to issue up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock and may issue preferred stock in future financings or in lieu of outstanding debt. This preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the Board without further action by shareholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock may include preferential voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividend, liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock, and therefore, reduce the value of common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict the ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party and thereby preserve control by the present management.\nProvisions in the articles of incorporation, bylaws and Florida law also could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or making a tender offer or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a shareholder might consider favorable. Such provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by the shareholders to replace or remove the management team. In particular, the articles of incorporation, bylaws and Florida law, as applicable, among other things, provide the Board with the ability to alter the bylaws without shareholder approval, and provide that vacancies on the Board may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum.\nIn addition, the Amended Share Exchange Agreement provides for the issuance of the Second Tranche Stock to Rochon Capital solely upon the occurrence of certain stock acquisitions by third parties or the announcement of certain tender or exchange offers of common stock. The Second Tranche Stock, which possess no rights other than voting rights, may serve as a further deterrent to third parties looking to acquire us. See the section entitled \"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\".\nResales of our common stock in the public market by our stockholders may cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nThis issuance of shares of common stock in any offering, could result in resales of the common stock by the current stockholders concerned about the potential dilution of their holdings. In turn, these resales could have the effect of depressing the market price for the common stock.\nThere is no public market for the Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock that were sold in the March 2015 offering.\nThere is no established public trading market for the Warrants that were sold in the March 2015 offering, and the Company does not expect a market to develop. In addition, the Company does not intend to apply to list the Warrants on any national securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system, including the NYSE American. Without an active market, the liquidity of the Warrants will be limited.", "PERMNO": 15099, "SIC": 5960, "TIC": "JRJRQ"}
