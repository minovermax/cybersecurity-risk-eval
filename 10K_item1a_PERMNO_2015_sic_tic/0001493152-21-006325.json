{"cik": "1591890", "company": "FG Financial Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Industry, Business and Operations\nWe have had limited operations upon which to predict our future performance, since the sale of the Maison Business.\nWe sold our Maison Business at the end of 2019 and, since then, have begun to implement our business plans to operate as a diversified insurance, reinsurance, real estate, and investment management holding company. Accordingly, our historical financial statements provide little basis upon which to predict our future performance. Our revenue has also been reduced, as we have limited assets with which to generate revenue. Our failure to secure additional sources of revenue may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the uncertainty surrounding our future operations and business prospects may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock. If we are unable to implement our business plans successfully, our financial condition and results of operations will be impaired, and your investment in our Company will be at risk.\nFG FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\nWe incurred a substantial loss during our first year following the sale of the Maison Business.\nWe sustained a loss of $22,457,000 during 2020, the first year following the sale of the Maison Business. If we continue to incur such losses, we may be unable to continue our business, and you could lose your entire investment in the Company.\nWe may need additional capital in the future in order to grow and operate our business. Such capital may not be available to us or may not be available to us on favorable terms. Furthermore, our raising additional capital could dilute your ownership interest in our company.\nWe expect that we will need to raise additional capital in the future through public or private equity or debt offerings or otherwise in order to further capitalize our reinsurance subsidiary and implement our business strategy, fund liquidity needs caused by underwriting or investment losses, replace capital lost in the event of significant reinsurance losses or adverse reserve developments, meet applicable statutory jurisdiction requirements; and/or expand business to include the sponsorship of a risk retention group to address the D&O liability insurance needs of the SPAC market.\nIf we were required to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders\u2019 ownership could result, and in any case such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of existing shareholders. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business or pay dividends. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe intend to participate in a risk retention group which will provide director\u2019s and officer\u2019s insurance to special purpose acquisition companies and represents a line of insurance for which we do not have previous experience.\nRisk retention groups (\u201cRRG\u201d) are mutual companies, or companies owned by the members of the group that allow businesses with similar insurance needs to pool their risks and form an insurance company that operates under state regulated guidelines. Risk retention groups are treated differently from traditional insurance companies in that they are exempted from having to obtain a license in every state in which they write insurance, and are also exempt from other various state laws that regulate insurance. As a result, a RRG may not be adequately capitalized and able to remain solvent if faced with continuing losses. While we intend to mitigate this risk through the purchase of reinsurance, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to purchase adequate reinsurance on favorable terms. Due to our inexperience in providing director\u2019s and officer\u2019s insurance, we run the risk of underwriting our coverage at levels that do not provide adequate returns for our shareholders. Furthermore, we run the risk of not generating external interest in our RRG after incurring significant start-up and regulatory costs associated with the formation of the group.\nWe do not have an operating history or established reputation in the reinsurance industry, and our lack of an established operating history and reputation may make it difficult for us to attract or retain business.\nAs part of our business going forward, we plan to provide specialty property and casualty reinsurance through FGRe. We will not have an operating history on which we can base an estimate of our future earnings prospects. We also do not have an established reputation in the reinsurance industry. Reputation is a very important factor in the reinsurance industry, and competition for business is, in part, based on reputation. Although we expect that our reinsurance policies will be fully collateralized, we will be a relatively newly formed reinsurance company and do not yet have a well-established reputation in the reinsurance industry. Our lack of an established reputation may make it difficult for us to attract or retain business. We will compete with major reinsurers, all of which have substantially greater financial marketing and management resources than we do, which may make it difficult for us to effectively market our products or offer our products at a profit. In addition, we do not have, nor do we currently intend to obtain financial strength ratings, which may discourage certain counterparties from entering into reinsurance contracts with us and may prevent us from writing certain types of business.\nAs a reinsurer, we will depend on our clients\u2019 evaluations of the risks associated with their insurance underwriting, which may subject us to reinsurance losses.\nIn the proportional reinsurance business, in which we will assume an agreed percentage of each underlying insurance contract being reinsured, or quota share contracts, we do not plan to separately evaluate each of the original individual risks assumed under these reinsurance contracts. We will therefore be largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies, which will subject us to the risk that the clients may not have adequately evaluated the insured risks and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume. Those risks could be concentrated in relatively few industries, companies, geographic regions, asset types or other areas of risk. This limited diversification could expose us to losses which are disproportionate to the overall insurance market. We also have non-exclusive contracts with third parties for their underwriting services. We also do not plan to separately evaluate each of the individual claims made on the underlying insurance contracts under quota share arrangements, in which case we will be dependent on the original claims decisions made by our clients.\nThe involvement of reinsurance brokers may subject us to their credit risk.\nAs a standard practice of the reinsurance industry, reinsurers frequently pay amounts owed on claims under their policies to reinsurance brokers, and these brokers, in turn, remit these amounts to the ceding companies that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with the reinsurer. In some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a payment, the reinsurer might remain liable to the client for the deficiency notwithstanding the broker\u2019s obligation to make such payment. Conversely, in certain jurisdictions, when the client pays premiums for policies to reinsurance brokers for payment to the reinsurer, these premiums are considered to have been paid and the client will no longer be liable to the reinsurer for these premiums, whether or not the reinsurer has actually received them from the broker. Consequently, as a reinsurer, we expect to assume a degree of credit risk associated with the brokers that we intend to do business with.\nWe may not be successful in carrying out our investment and investment management strategy, and the fair value of our investments will be subject to a loss in value.\nWe have formed an investment advisory firm subsidiary, FGSC which is a relying advisor of an affiliated investment advisor registered with the SEC, to carry out our investment advisory services. We have also formed Fundamental Global Asset Management, LLC, a joint venture with Fundamental Global Investors, LLC to sponsor investment advisors that we anticipate will manage private funds ranging the full spectrum of alternative equities, fixed income, private equity and real estate. In exchange for seeding the new funds, we expect to receive a special interest in each new fund (or its general partner). Since we plan to conduct our investment activities through private funds, our contributions made to those funds may be subject to lock-up agreements and our ability to access this capital may be limited for a defined period, which may increase a risk of loss of all or a significant portion of value. Our investments may also become concentrated. A significant decline in the values of these investments may produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity and can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated book value per share and earnings.\nFG FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\nAs discussed above under Item 1. \u201cBusiness,\u201d in connection with the Asset Sale, the Advisor and FedNat have entered into an investment advisory agreement in which the Advisor has agreed to provide investment advisory services to FedNat, including identifying, analyzing and recommending potential investments, advising as to existing investments and investment optimization, recommending investment dispositions, and providing advice regarding macro-economic conditions. Any fees received for such services may not be commensurate with the services provided. We also may not be able to enter into such advisory management agreements with other entities on favorable terms, or at all. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have purchased interests in income producing real estate assets, and seek to benefit from underlying rental income on long-term leases with high quality tenants as well as the capital appreciation from the underlying real estate assets. Investments in real estate assets are subject to varying degrees of risk. For example, an investment in real estate cannot generally be quickly converted to cash, limiting our ability to promptly vary our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions. Investments in real estate assets are also subject to adverse changes in general economic conditions which may reduce the demand for rental space. Moreover, we may not be able to acquire quality, income producing real estate assets or attract high-quality tenants on favorable terms, if at all. We also expect to compete with numerous other persons or entities seeking to buy real estate assets, including real estate investment trusts or other real estate operating companies with greater experience and financial strength. Any of these factors could impact our real estate investment strategy and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe insurance and reinsurance business is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully in our industry.\nThe insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete with major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and reinsurers, many of which have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do. There has been significant consolidation in the insurance and reinsurance sector in recent years, and we may experience increased competition as a result of that consolidation, with consolidated entities having enhanced market power. These consolidated entities may use their enhanced market power and broader capital base to negotiate price reductions for products and services that compete with ours, and we may experience rate declines and possibly write less business. Any failure by us to effectively compete could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe insurance and reinsurance industry is highly cyclical, and we may at times experience periods characterized by excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates.\nHistorically, insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition, frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, general economic conditions, changes in equity, debt and other investment markets, changes in legislation, case law and prevailing concepts of liability and other factors. Demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by the underwriting results of primary insurers and prevailing general economic conditions. The supply of insurance and reinsurance is related to prevailing prices and levels of surplus capacity that, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return being realized in the insurance and reinsurance industry on both underwriting and investment sides. As a result, the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity, as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels and changes in terms and conditions. Until recently, the supply of insurance and reinsurance had increased over the past several years, and may again in the future, either as a result of capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers. Continued increases in the supply of insurance and reinsurance may have consequences for us, including fewer contracts written, lower premium rates, increased expenses for customer acquisition and retention, and less favorable policy terms and conditions.\nFG FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\nClimate change, as well as increasing regulation in the area of climate change, may adversely affect our insurance and reinsurance business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanging weather patterns and climatic conditions, such as global warming, may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. Although the loss experience of catastrophe insurers and reinsurers has historically been characterized as low frequency, there is a growing concern today that climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, and, in recent years, the frequency of major catastrophes appears to have resumed historical levels or increased and may continue to increase in the future.\nClaims for catastrophic events, or an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period, could expose us to large losses, cause substantial volatility in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to write new business if we are not able to adequately assess and reserve for the increased frequency and severity of catastrophes resulting from these environmental factors. Additionally, catastrophic events could result in declines in the value of investments we hold and significant disruptions to our physical infrastructure, systems, and operations. Climate change-related risks may also specifically adversely impact the value of the securities that we hold.\nChanges in security asset prices may impact the value of our real estate investments, resulting in realized or unrealized losses on our invested assets. These risks are not limited to, but can include: (i) changes in supply/demand characteristics for fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil, natural gas); (ii) advances in low-carbon technology and renewable energy development; and (iii) effects of extreme weather events on the physical and operational exposure of industries and issuers, and the transition that these companies make towards addressing climate risk in their own businesses.\nHowever, we cannot predict how legal, regulatory and/or social responses to concerns around global climate change may impact our business. There can be no assurance that our reinsurance coverage and other measures taken will be sufficient to mitigate losses resulting from one or more catastrophic events. As a result, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events and the continuation and worsening of recent trends could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance and sustainability have become major topics that encompass a wide range of issues, including climate change and other environmental risks. We are also subject to complex and changing laws, regulation and public policy debates relating to climate change which are difficult to predict and quantify and may have an adverse impact on our business. Changes in regulations relating to climate change or our own leadership decisions implemented as a result of assessing the impact of climate change on our business may result in an increase in the cost of doing business or a decrease in premiums in certain lines of business.\nUnderwriting risks and reserving for losses are based on probabilities and related modeling, which are subject to inherent uncertainties.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses that we insure and reinsure. We establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses which represent estimates based on actuarial and statistical projections, at a given point in time, of our expectations of the ultimate future settlement and administration costs of losses incurred. We utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of loss reserves. Most or all of these factors are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and the effects of these and unforeseen factors could negatively impact our ability to accurately assess the risks of the policies that we write. Changes in the assumptions used by these models or by management could lead to an increase in our estimate of ultimate losses in the future. In addition, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is reported to the insurer and additional lags between the time of reporting and final settlement of claims. In addition, the estimation of loss reserves is more difficult during times of adverse economic and market conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties or increased frequency of small claims. Changes in the level of inflation also result in an increased level of uncertainty in our estimation of loss reserves. As a result, actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid can deviate, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements.\nFG FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\nIf our loss reserves are determined to be inadequate, we will be required to increase loss reserves at the time of such determination with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period when the deficiency becomes known. It is possible that claims in respect of events that have occurred could exceed our claim reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, in a particular period, or our financial condition in general. As a compounding factor, although most insurance contracts have policy limits, the nature of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance is such that losses and the associated expenses can exceed policy limits for a variety of reasons and could significantly exceed the premiums received on the underlying policies, thereby further adversely affecting our financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Financial Markets and Investments\nAdverse developments in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and our businesses, and may also limit our access to capital.\nAdverse developments in the financial markets, such as disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets, may result in realized and unrealized capital losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and our businesses, and may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. Depending on market conditions, we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses on our investment portfolio in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business. Economic conditions could also have a material impact on the frequency and severity of claims and therefore could negatively impact our underwriting returns. The volatility in the financial markets could continue to significantly affect our investment returns, reported results, and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nThe capital requirements of our businesses depend on many factors, including regulatory and rating agency requirements, the performance of our investment portfolio, our ability to write new business successfully, the frequency and severity of catastrophe events and our ability to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses.\nOur investments in special purpose acquisition companies as well as the sponsors of special purpose acquisition companies involve a high degree of risk.\nWe expect to invest in initial public offerings (\u201cIPOs\u201d) of special purpose acquisition companies (\u201cSPACs\u201d), including SPACs that are sponsored by our affiliates. In general, a SPAC is a special purpose vehicle that is formed to raise capital from the public through an IPO with the purpose, usually, of using the proceeds to acquire a single unspecified business or assets to be identified after the IPO. The IPO proceeds are held in a trust account until released to fund a business combination or used to redeem shares sold in the IPO. SPACs are required to either consummate a business combination or liquidate within a set period of time following their IPO. Because, at the time of the IPO, the SPAC has no operating history or any plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective investment targets, we will have no basis upon which to evaluate the SPAC\u2019s ability to achieve its business objectives. If a SPAC fails to complete its initial business transaction within the required time period, it will never generate any operating revenues and our SPAC investment may receive only a fixed dollar amount per share upon redemption, or less than such fixed amount in certain circumstances which could significantly affect our operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2020, we have invested $4.0 million to acquire equity interests in the sponsor of a SPAC (\u201cSponsor\u201d) and expect to acquire additional interests in sponsors of SPACs in the future. By investing in a Sponsor, we have provided risk capital which allows the Sponsor to launch the IPO of the SPAC. In exchange for this investment, we own interests in the Sponsor that entitle us to receive distributions of shares and warrants in the SPAC after the lock-up period following the SPACs IPO has expired. These Sponsor interests do not have redemption rights to receive any portion of our original investment back from the trust account of the SPAC, as is normally associated with an IPO investment directly into a SPAC. Accordingly, an investment in a Sponsor is subject to a much higher degree of risk than an investment in a SPAC because the entire investment may be lost if the SPAC is not successful in consummating a business combination. Such potential loss could have a material effect on our financial results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nRisks Relating to Sale of Maison Business\nThe shares of FedNat common stock we have received as part of the consideration for the Asset Sale are subject to certain limitations and restrictions.\nThe shares of FedNat common stock we have received in the Asset Sale were issued pursuant to the terms of a Standstill Agreement entered into between the Company and FedNat upon the closing of the Asset Sale. The Standstill Agreement imposes certain limitations and restrictions with respect to our ownership of FedNat common stock, including, among other things, requiring us to vote all of the voting securities of FedNat we own in accordance with the recommendation of FedNat\u2019s board of directors and prohibiting us from publicly advising or influencing any person with respect to the voting of any shares of FedNat common stock and taking any action to nominate any person for election to FedNat\u2019s board of directors. Our status as a minority stockholder of FedNat as well as the limitations and restrictions expected to be set forth in the Standstill Agreement may limit our ability to exert significant influence on FedNat\u2019s management and operations and matters requiring approval of FedNat\u2019s stockholders. FedNat\u2019s management and holders of a larger percentage of FedNat\u2019s common stock may also take or encourage actions that decrease the value of our shares of FedNat common stock or are not in our best interests as a minority stockholder.\nAs a result of the Asset Sale, we are a very small public company with a large cash balance relative to our market capitalization.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $12.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $18.0 million in investments. We expect to invest significant funds into the implementation of our new business strategy, which will increase our operating expenses. Until we secure additional revenue streams, we may lose a significant amount of cash, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by financial market performance, general economic conditions, and other factors that may result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFG FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\nWe also remain subject to the listing standards of Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and have an obligation to continue to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of the Exchange Act even though compliance with these reporting requirements is economically burdensome. While all public companies face the costs and burdens associated with being publicly traded, given our limited business operations, the costs and burdens of being a public company may be material.\nWe are subject to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants under the Purchase Agreement, which may limit our operations in certain respects.\nWe are subject to the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants in the Purchase Agreement until December 2, 2024. During this period of time, subject to certain exceptions, we will generally be prohibited from (i) marketing, selling and issuing residential property and casualty insurance policies to residential consumers anywhere in the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas (a \u201cRestricted Business\u201d), and owning the equity securities of, managing, operating or controlling any person that engages in a Restricted Business, (ii) hiring or soliciting certain employees of FedNat or the companies sold under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and (iii) soliciting or accepting business from certain third parties on any customer, agent or vendor list of Maison, MMI, or ClaimCor in connection with a Restricted Business. The non-competition covenant does not apply to our reinsurance business, and we will be permitted to enter into reinsurance contracts in the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas.\nThe limitations set forth in the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants may negatively impact the scope of our future operations, limit our recruitment of key employees, restrict our ability to enter into strategic relationships, and impair our ability to pursue certain business alternatives, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur failure to obtain or maintain approval of insurance regulators and other regulatory authorities as required for the operations of our reinsurance subsidiary may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFGRe has a Class B (iii) insurer license in accordance with the terms of The Insurance Law, 2010 and underlying regulations thereto, and is subject to regulation by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (\u201cCIMA\u201d). Insurance statutes and policies of CIMA regulate items such as the minimum levels of capital at FGRe and the surplus and liquidity of FGRe. Furthermore, CIMA may restrict dividends and distributions from FGRe, require we obtain advance approval of ownership and transfer of shares, and maintain a principal office and maintain a principal representative on the island of Grand Cayman. Failure to comply with the laws, regulations and requirements applicable to a Cayman Islands-domiciled reinsurance subsidiary could result in consequences which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe will be subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nWe will be subject to the risk of inadvertently becoming an investment company, which would require us to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive and potentially adverse regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends and transactions with affiliates. Registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which we currently operate and plan to operate our business in the future.\nWe plan to monitor the value of our investments and structure our operations and transactions to qualify for exemptions under the Investment Company Act. Accordingly, we may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if we did not have Investment Company Act concerns, or we may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions due to those concerns. In addition, adverse developments with respect to our ownership of our operating subsidiaries, including significant appreciation or depreciation in the market value of certain of our publicly traded holdings, could result in our inadvertently becoming an investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company.\nFG FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors. We currently qualify as a smaller reporting company under the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). As a smaller reporting company we are exempt from the requirement to include the auditor\u2019s report of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting until such time as we no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company based on our public float and our reporting of more than $100 million in annual revenues in a fiscal year. Regardless of our qualification status, we have implemented control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and applicable requirements of Nasdaq, among other items. Maintaining these internal controls is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention.\nOur evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify material weaknesses that may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC, or violations of Nasdaq\u2019s listing rules. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could also lead to a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWhile we currently qualify as a smaller reporting company under SEC regulations, we cannot be certain if we take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to these companies that we will not make our common stock less attractive to investors. Once we lose smaller reporting company status, the costs and demands placed upon our management are expected to increase.\nThe SEC\u2019s rules permit smaller reporting companies like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies. As long as we qualify as a smaller reporting company, based on our public float, and report less than $100 million in annual revenues in a fiscal year we are permitted, and we intend to, omit the auditor\u2019s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe lost our status as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2019. While we expect to remain a smaller reporting company and non-accelerated filer, we now face increased disclosure requirements as a non-emerging growth company, such as stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation (\u201csay-on-pay\u201d). Until such time that we lose smaller reporting company status, it is unclear if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on certain disclosure exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and could cause our stock price to decline. As a result of the loss of our emerging growth company status, the costs and demands placed upon our management have increased, as we now must comply with additional disclosure and accounting requirements. In addition, even if we remain a smaller reporting company, if our public float exceeds $75 million and we report $100 million or more in annual revenues in a fiscal year, we will become subject to the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring an independent registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, making the public reporting process more costly.\nFG FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\nHolders of our outstanding shares of 8.00% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, have dividend, liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common shares.\nAs of March 12, 2021, we have issued and outstanding 700,000 shares of preferred stock designated as 8.00% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $25.00 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). The aggregate liquidation preference with respect to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock is approximately $17.5 million, and annual dividends on the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are $1.4 million. Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of lawfully available funds for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends from and including the original issue date at the rate of 8.00% of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to $2.00 per annum per share). Upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, before any payment is made to holders of our common shares, holders of these preferred shares are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of payment. This would reduce the remaining amount of our assets, if any, available to distribute to holders of our common shares.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to designate and issue additional preferred shares with liquidation, dividend and other rights that are senior to those of our common shares similar to the rights of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock. Because our decision to issue additional securities will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities issuances reducing the market price of our common shares and diluting their interests.\nWe may fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of Nasdaq and may have to delist our common shares.\nEven though we currently satisfy the continued listing standards for Nasdaq and expect to continue to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to satisfy the continued listing standards in the future. In the event that we are unable to satisfy the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, our common shares may be delisted from that market. Any delisting of our common shares from Nasdaq could:\n\u25cf adversely affect our ability to attract new investors;\n\u25cf decrease the liquidity of our outstanding common shares;\n\u25cf reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital;\n\u25cf reduce the price at which our common shares trade; and\n\u25cf increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such common shares with overall negative effects for our stockholders.\nIn addition, delisting of our common shares could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our common shares, and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our securities at all. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect the price of our common shares and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnology and Operational Risks\nOur information technology systems may fail or suffer a loss of security which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our computer and data processing systems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to process our business timely and efficiently and protect our information systems from physical loss or unauthorized access. In the event that our systems cannot be accessed due to a natural catastrophe, terrorist attack or power outage, or systems and telecommunications failures or outages, external attacks such as computer viruses, malware or cyber-attacks, or other disruptions occur, our ability to perform business operations on a timely basis could be significantly impaired and may cause our systems to be inaccessible for an extended period of time. A sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to perform necessary business operations in a timely manner, hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFG FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\nOur operations also depend on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. From time to time, we may experience threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. Computer viruses, hackers, phishing attacks, social engineering schemes, ransomware, employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions. In addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means. Our systems and networks may be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our customers\u2019 information or theft of funds and other monetary loss, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of customers or affiliated advisers or other damage to our business.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and management, which could adversely impact our ability to successfully implement and execute our business and growth strategy.\nThe successful implementation of our business and growth strategy depends in large part upon the ability and experience of members of our management and other personnel. We experienced a number of personnel changes in connection with the closing of our Asset Sale, including the resignations of our President and Chief Executive Officer, and our Vice President and Chief Underwriting Officer.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had three employees, Larry G. Swets, Jr., who serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, John S. Hill, who serves as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Brian D. Bottjer, who serves as our Senior Vice President and Controller. Our performance will be dependent on our ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain qualified management and personnel with experience in the reinsurance industry, investment advisory services, and in real estate investments. We may not be able to attract and retain such personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. If we lose the service of qualified management or other personnel or are unable to attract and retain the necessary members of management or personnel, we may not be able to successfully execute on our business strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have directors who also serve as directors and/or executive officers for other public companies or for our controlling stockholders or their affiliates, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nWe have directors who serve as executive officers and/or directors of other public companies. One of our directors also serves as CEO of Fundamental Global Investors, LLC (\u201cFGI\u201d) and its affiliates, which together, as of December 31, 2020, beneficially owned approximately 61% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, FGI and its affiliates beneficially own 5% of our outstanding shares of 8.00% cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A. One of our directors serves as an executive officer and director of Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. (OTC: AFHIF) (\u201cAtlas\u201d), a specialty commercial automobile insurance company. In addition, our chief executive officer and director, Mr. Swets and our chairman, Mr. Cerminara, also currently serve as executive officers of FG New America Acquisition Corp, (NYSE: FGNA), a blank check company formed to effect a merger, reorganization or similar business combination. We have sponsored a portion of the risk capital used to launch FGNA, through an investment of approximately $4 million in our joint venture, Fundamental Global Asset Management, LLC. Mr. Swets also serves as director of Limbach Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: LMB) (\u201cLimbach\u201d), an affiliate of KFSI (which, together with its affiliates, holds a warrant exercisable for common shares representing 23% of our outstanding shares of common stock). On October 13, 2020 our director, Mr. Wong, was appointed to the Board of Directors of Harbor Custom Development, Inc. (Nasdaq: HCDI), and serves as the chairperson of its audit committee. Our Director, General Payne, also currently serves on the Board of Directors of BK Technologies Corporation (NYSE American: BKTI).\nOur executive officers and members of our Company\u2019s Board of Directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders; likewise, persons who serve in similar capacities at Atlas, FGNA, Limbach and FGI have fiduciary duties to those companies\u2019 investors. We may find, though, the potential for a conflict of interest if our Company and one or more of these other companies pursue acquisitions, investments and other business opportunities that may be suitable for each of us. Our directors who find themselves in these multiple roles may, as a result, have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Furthermore, our directors who find themselves in these multiple roles own stock options, shares of common stock and other securities in some of these entities. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our Company and these other entities. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with or participate jointly in investments with Atlas, FGNA, Limbach or FGI or its affiliates. We may create new situations in the future in which our directors serve as directors or executive officers in future investment holdings of such entities.\nFG FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\nOur executive officers and directors will allocate their time to our and other businesses in which they are involved in their discretion, potentially to the detriment of the Company.\nOur executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and those other businesses in which they are involved. Our chief executive officer is engaged in other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific numbers of hours per week to our affairs. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. If our executive officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 elect to devote substantial amounts of time to the affairs of other businesses in excess of current levels, they might not assign sufficient attention to the Company, potentially impairing our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects and the value of our securities.\nMembers of our management and companies with which they are affiliated in the past have been, and may in the future be, involved in civil disputes and litigation and governmental investigations relating to their business affairs unrelated to our company. Any such claims or investigations may divert management\u2019s attention from our business or be detrimental to our reputation, resulting in adverse effects upon our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects and the value of our securities held by investors.\nWe have a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company. Our inexperience as a public company and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members and have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nWe have a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company. As a publicly-traded company, we are required to develop and implement substantial control systems, policies and procedures in order to satisfy our periodic SEC reporting and Nasdaq obligations. Management\u2019s past experience may not be sufficient to successfully develop and implement these systems, policies and procedures and to operate our company. Failure to do so could jeopardize our status as a public company, and the loss of such status may have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nIn addition, as a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and Nasdaq rules, including those promulgated in response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we need to continually commit significant resources, maintain staff and provide additional management oversight. In addition, implementing our business strategy and sustaining our growth will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our organization and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a public company, we incur significant annual expenses related to these steps associated with, among other things, director fees, reporting requirements, transfer agent fees, accounting, administrative personnel, auditing and legal fees and similar expenses. We also incur higher costs for director and officer liability insurance. Any of these factors make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors. Finally, we expect to incur additional costs once we lose smaller reporting company status or are required to provide an auditor attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nFG FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\nRisks Related to Investment Performance\nOur results of operations will fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\nWe anticipate that the performance of our reinsurance operations and our future investment and real estate portfolios will fluctuate from period to period. In addition, because we plan to underwrite products and make investments to achieve favorable return on equity over the long-term, our short-term results of operations may not be indicative of our long-term prospects. Our results of operations may also be adversely impacted by general economic conditions and the conditions and outlook of the reinsurance markets and capital markets.\nChanges in the value of the investments we own could materially affect our income and increase the volatility of our earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2020 we have invested approximately $4 million as a seed investment to sponsor the launch of FG New America Acquisition Corp (NYSE: FGNA), a special purpose acquisition company which consummated its initial public offering on October 2, 2020. Our investment consists of both class A and class A-1 interests of the sponsor company, which represent beneficial ownership of approximately 1.4 million common shares of FGNA as well as approximately 0.4 million warrants to purchase common shares of FGNA at a price of $11.50 per share. The class A and class A-1 interests were purchased in a private placement and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and are not transferrable except as provided for in the operating agreement of the Sponsor. Should FGNA not complete an initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of their initial public offering, our investment could be subject to total loss, materially affecting our operating results.\nOur investment in FG New America Acquisition Corp (\u201cFGNA\u201d) as well as any such investments we make in the future in the at-risk capital of SPACs, directly or via the SPAC sponsor entities, do not have redemption rights to receive the original investment back from the trust account of the SPAC, with such redemption rights afforded only to investors in initial public offerings of SPACs. For this reason, such investments would become worthless if the SPAC fails to consummate a business combination within the specified time frame, which is typically 24 months from its initial public offering. Our investment in FGNA as well as such future investments are subject to transfer restrictions and additional risks which include the following:\n\u25cf The ability of SPAC public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of SPAC shares could increase the probability that its business combination would be unsuccessful.\n\u25cf The requirement for SPACs to complete the business combination within 24 months after the initial public offering may give potential target businesses leverage over the SPAC in negotiating a business combination, in particular as a SPAC approaches its dissolution deadline, which could undermine its ability to complete the business combination on terms that would produce value for our investment.\n\u25cf If a SPAC we are invested in is deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, it may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and its activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for it to complete the business combination.\n\u25cf Past performance by SPAC\u2019s management team and their affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in such a SPAC.\n\u25cf SPACs are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from a valuation or appraisal firm, and consequently, we may have no assurance from an independent source that the SPAC we invest in is paying a fair price for the target business from a financial point of view.\n\u25cf We may experience dilution to our investment in any particular SPAC from additional issuance of shares by the SPAC in its business combination with a target business.\n\u25cf A SPAC\u2019s officers and directors often have additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented in regard to merger. Additionally, the sponsor, executive officers and directors of SPACs we invest in may and often do hold at-risk investments in such SPACs. Since such sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in the SPAC if the business combination is not completed, a conflict of interest may arise in determining for such SPACs whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for a business combination.\n\u25cf A SPAC is considered an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if the SPAC we invest in takes advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, this could make its securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare its performance with other public companies.\nWe also own approximately 1.4 million shares of FedNat common stock representing approximately 25% of the total assets listed on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The value of this investment has declined considerably since our initial investment, and could continue to decline, materially affecting our income and causing volatility in our earnings. Furthermore, the shares of FedNat common stock were issued to us pursuant to the terms of a Standstill Agreement entered into between the Company and FedNat upon the closing of the Asset Sale. Should we need to reduce or completely liquidate our investment in FedNat common stock to maintain our liquidity or for any other reason, we may be limited as to the timing and number of shares we can sell pursuant to the terms of the Standstill Agreement.\nRisks Related to Our Significant Shareholder\nFundamental Global Investors, LLC and its affiliates control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.\nAs of December 31, 2020, FGI and its affiliates own approximately 61% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Accordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support. D. Kyle Cerminara, Chairman of our Board of Directors, serves as Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Partner of FGI. Due to his position on our Board of Directions as well as his position at FGI, he has considerable influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote. See Risks Related to Human Capital-Our executive officers and directors will allocate their time to our and other businesses in which they are involved in their discretion, potentially to the detriment of the Company and-We have directors who also serve as directors and/or executive officers for other public companies or for our controlling stockholders or their affiliates, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUnfavorable global economic conditions, including as a result of health and safety concerns, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations and the implementation of our new business strategy could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, including conditions that are outside of our control, such as the impact of health and safety concerns from the current outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus. The most recent global financial crisis caused by the coronavirus resulted in extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business and could delay the implementation of our new business strategy.\nFG FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Adverse events such as health-related concerns about working in our offices, the inability to travel and other matters affecting the general work environment have negatively impacted and could continue to harm our business and our business strategy. In addition, during the pandemic, we have experienced significant losses related to the value of our investment in shares of FedNat common stock, and we may continue to experience such losses to the extent the pandemic negatively impacts FedNat\u2019s business. The extent to which our operations and investments may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new developments concerning the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities to contain the pandemic or treat its impact. In the event of a major disruption caused by the pandemic, we may lose the services of our employees, experience system interruptions or face challenges accessing the capital or credit markets, which could lead to diminishment of our business operations. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and delay the implementation of our business strategy.", "PERMNO": 14607, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "PIH"}
