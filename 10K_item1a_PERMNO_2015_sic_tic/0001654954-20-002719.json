{"cik": "33992", "company": "KINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS.\nFactors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\nBased upon the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. These factors, among others, may affect the accuracy of certain forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, stock price and reputation.\nWe have identified a material weakness in the internal control over financial reporting related to the operation of controls related to the establishment and ongoing monitoring of case reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses. Based on the material weakness, our management has determined that we have not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. See Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d for a discussion of the internal control over financial reporting and the material weakness.\n\"Internal controls over financial reporting\" refer to those procedures within a company that are designed to reasonably ensure the accuracy of the company's financial statements. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to annually assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nIf we fail to achieve and maintain adequate internal controls, or if we have material weaknesses in our internal controls, in each case in accordance with applicable standards, we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404.\nBecause effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the market price for our stock could decline if our internal controls are ineffective or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified.\nMajor public health issues could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nMajor public health issues, including a large-scale pandemic, such as the novel coronavirus COVID-19, may have a material adverse effect on our workforce and business operations and cause disruptions in commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets, changes in interest rates, reduced liquidity and economic activity caused by a large-scale pandemic. Accordingly, a large-scale pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, liquidity and operating results.\nAs a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events.\nBecause of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events (such as Superstorm Sandy) and other severe weather events, our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, severe winter weather, storms and certain types of terrorism. We currently have catastrophe reinsurance coverage with regard to losses of up to $610,000,000. The initial $7,500,000 of losses in a catastrophe are subject to a 25% quota share reinsurance treaty, such that we retain $5,625,000 of risk per catastrophe occurrence. With respect to any additional catastrophe losses of up to $602,500,000, we are 100% reinsured under our catastrophe reinsurance program. Catastrophe coverage is limited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts. We may incur catastrophe losses in excess of: (i) those that we project would be incurred, (ii) those that external modeling firms estimate would be incurred, (iii) the average expected level used in pricing or (iv) our current reinsurance coverage limits. Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which may result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our financial strength ratings. In addition, the reinsurance losses that are incurred in connection with a catastrophe could have an adverse impact on the terms and conditions of future reinsurance treaties.\nIn addition, we are subject to claims arising from non-catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, severe winter weather, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of claims when severe weather conditions occur.\nUnanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the severity or frequency of claims may affect our profitability. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and home furnishings, and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and by litigation costs. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, prices of auto parts and used car prices. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict, such as a change in the law or an inability to enforce exclusions and limitations contained in our policies. Although we pursue various loss management initiatives to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity, and a significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nA downgrade in our financial strength rating from A.M. Best may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, the marketability of our product offerings, and our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.\nIn April 2017, A.M. Best upgraded the financial strength rating of KICO to A- (Excellent) from B++ (Good). Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company's business. Many insurance buyers, agents, brokers and secured lenders use the ratings assigned by A.M. Best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies with which they do business or from which they are considering purchasing insurance or in determining the financial strength of the company that provides insurance with respect to the collateral they hold. A.M. Best ratings are derived from an in-depth evaluation of an insurance company\u2019s balance sheet strengths, operating performances and business profiles. A.M. Best evaluates, among other factors, the company\u2019s capitalization, underwriting leverage, financial leverage, asset leverage, capital structure, quality and appropriateness of reinsurance, adequacy of reserves, quality and diversification of assets, liquidity, profitability, spread of risk, revenue composition, market position, management, market risk and event risk. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies such as A.M. Best review the financial performance and condition of insurers and can downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer's ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurer's statutory capital, a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer's control. All ratings are subject to continuous review; therefore, the retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A downgrade in our financial strength rating from A.M. Best could have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness, the marketability of our product offerings and our ability to grow in the marketplace.\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms.\nThe capital and credit markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. In some cases, markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity. In the event that we need access to additional capital to support our operating expenses, make payments on our outstanding and any future indebtedness, pay for capital expenditures, or increase the amount of insurance that we seek to underwrite or to otherwise grow our business, our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant. Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as lenders' perception of our long or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If a combination of these factors occurs, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our net investment income can vary from period to period.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, equity prices, market volatility, general economic conditions, the performance of the economy in general, the performance of the specific obligors included in our portfolio, and other factors outside our control. Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments, such as fixed income securities, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A rise in interest rates would increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, which would be offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would decrease the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, which would be offset by lower rates of return on funds reinvested.\nIn addition, market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. As such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. If significant, continued volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in defaults, a lack of pricing transparency, market liquidity and declines in equity prices, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized positions.\nReinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business or maintain our financial strength rating from A.M. Best.\nWe purchase reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to protect against possible catastrophes, to remain within a target ratio of net premiums written to policyholders\u2019 surplus and to expand our underwriting capacity. Participation in reinsurance arrangements does not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders. Our personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to address our exposure to catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be given that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as currently available. For example, our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost, and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available in the future. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we will have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk, reduce our insurance writings or seek other alternatives. Our ability to maintain our financial strength rating from A.M. Best depends, in part, on our ability to purchase a sufficient level of catastrophe reinsurance.\nReinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including changes in market conditions, whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Since we are primarily liable to an insured for the full amount of insurance coverage, our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nApplicable insurance laws regarding the change of control of our company may impede potential acquisitions that our shareholders might consider desirable.\nWe are subject to statutes and regulations of the state of New York which generally require that any person or entity desiring to acquire direct or indirect control of KICO, our insurance company subsidiary, obtain prior regulatory approval. In addition, a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc. would require such approval. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of our company, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions. Some of our shareholders might consider such transactions to be desirable. Similar regulations may apply in other states in which we may operate.\nThe insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation that may affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business, and changes within this regulatory environment may adversely affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations. State insurance regulators are charged with protecting policyholders and have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers over our business practices. These include, among other things, the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business and the power to regulate and approve underwriting practices and rate changes, which may delay the implementation of premium rate changes, prevent us from making changes we believe are necessary to match rate to risk or delay or prevent our entry into new states. In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer\u2019s ability to cancel or not renew policies and that prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by state regulatory authorities. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets.\nBecause the laws and regulations under which we operate are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, state securities administrators and the SEC, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another's interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal and regulatory environment may, even in the absence of any change to a particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thereby necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and/or to improve the profitability of our business.\nWhile the United States federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal legislation and administrative policies can affect us. Congress and various federal agencies periodically discuss proposals that would provide for a federal charter for insurance companies. We cannot predict whether any such laws will be enacted or the effect that such laws would have on our business. Moreover, there can be no assurance that changes will not be made to current laws, rules and regulations, or that any other laws, rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future, that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to maintain the requisite amount of risk-based capital, which may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance markets.\nThe DFS imposes risk-based capital requirements on insurance companies to ensure that insurance companies maintain appropriate levels of surplus to support their overall business operations and to protect customers against adverse developments, after taking into account default, credit, underwriting and off-balance sheet risks. If the amount of our capital falls below certain thresholds, we may face restrictions with respect to soliciting new business and/or keeping existing business. Similar regulations apply in other states in which we operate.\nChanging climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows.\nWe recognize the scientific view that the world is getting warmer. Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency and/or severity of weather events and affect the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance.\nOur operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business.\nThe property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nBecause substantially all of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in New York, our business may be adversely affected by conditions in such state.\nApproximately 85% of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in the State of New York and, accordingly, is affected by the prevailing regulatory, economic, demographic, competitive and other conditions in the state. Changes in any of these conditions could make it costlier or difficult for us to conduct our business. Adverse regulatory developments in New York, which could include fundamental changes to the design or implementation of the insurance regulatory framework, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are highly dependent on a relatively small number of insurance brokers for a large portion of our revenues.\nWe market our insurance products primarily through insurance brokers. A large percentage of our gross premiums written are sourced through a limited number of brokers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, twenty-seven brokers provided a total of 35.1% of our total gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2019. The nature of our dependency on these brokers relates to the high volume of business they consistently refer to us. Our relationship with these brokers is based on the quality of the underwriting and claims services we provide to our clients and on our financial strength ratings. Any deterioration in these factors could result in these brokers advising clients to place their risks with other insurers rather than with us. A loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nActual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRecorded claim reserves for our business are based on our best estimates of losses after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. Internal and external factors are considered. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, actual claims paid, pending levels of unpaid claims, product mix and contractual terms. External factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the law, court decisions, changes in regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves, and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiary, KICO; there are restrictions on the payment of dividends by KICO.\nWe are a holding company and a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiary, KICO. As a holding company with limited operations of our own, currently the principal sources of our funds are dividends and other payments from KICO. Consequently, we must rely on KICO for our ability to repay debts (including $30,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due December 30, 2022 (the \u201cNotes\u2019)), pay expenses and pay cash dividends to our shareholders.\nState insurance laws limit the ability of KICO to pay dividends and require KICO to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus. Maximum allowable dividends by KICO to us are restricted to the lesser of 10% of surplus or 100% of net investment income (on a statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, less dividends paid by KICO during such period. As of December 31, 2019, the maximum permissible distribution that KICO could pay without prior regulatory approval was approximately $2,384,000. The aggregate maximum amount of dividends permitted by law to be paid by an insurance company does not necessarily define an insurance company\u2019s actual ability to pay dividends. The actual ability to pay dividends may be further constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, by our competitive position and by the amount of premiums that we can write. State insurance regulators have broad discretion to limit the payment of dividends by insurance companies. Our ability to pay interest on the Notes as it comes due and the principal of the Notes at their maturity may be limited by these regulatory constraints.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations, including the Notes.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flows from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes.\nOur future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive.\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have well-established national reputations, substantially more capital and significantly greater marketing and management resources. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for customers, agents and brokers, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and to maintain profitable operating results or financial condition.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon the efforts of Barry Goldstein, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman and Meryl Golden our Chief Operating Officer. The loss of Mr. Goldstein and Ms. Golden or other key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we continue to grow, we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel, but we may not be able to do so. Our ability to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of factors, such as our results of operations and prospects and the level of competition prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. Mr. Goldstein entered into an amended and restated employment agreement effective January 1, 2020 and expiring December 31, 2022. Ms. Golden entered into an employment agreement effective September 25, 2019 and expiring on December 31, 2021, whereby Ms. Golden became Chief Operating Officer.\nDifficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs with most businesses, we believe that difficult conditions in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. General economic conditions also could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior, which may include decreased demand for our products. As consumers become more cost conscious, they may choose to purchase lower levels of insurance.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, which are periodically revised, interpreted and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or those of one or more of our vendors.\nOur business requires that we develop and maintain computer systems to run our operations and to store a significant volume of confidential data. Some of these systems rely on third-party vendors, through either a connection to, or an integration with, those third-parties\u2019 systems. In the course of our operations, we acquire the personal confidential information of our customers and employees. We also store our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information.\nAll of these systems are subject to \u201ccyber attacks\u201d by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems. Such attacks or actions may include attempts to:\n\u25cf steal, corrupt, or destroy data, including our intellectual property, financial data or the personal information of our customers or employees\n\u25cf misappropriate funds\n\u25cf disrupt or shut down our systems\n\u25cf deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or\n\u25cf infect our systems with viruses or malware.\nWhile we can take defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. Our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. In addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen. In addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations. We have a cyber insurance policy to protect against the monetary impact of some of these risks. However, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber-attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems, and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems. We rely on these systems to support our operations. The failure of these systems could interrupt our operations and result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and certain present or former officers and directors are defendants in a putative class action asserting claims under the securities laws; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOn June 12, 2019, Phillip Woolgar filed a suit naming the Company and certain present or former officers and directors as defendants in a putative class action captioned Woolgar v. Kingstone Companies et al., 19 cv 05500 (S.D.N.Y.), asserting claims under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiff seeks to represent a class of persons or entities that purchased Kingstone securities between March 14, 2018, and April 29, 2019, and alleges violations of the federal securities law in connection with the Company\u2019s April 29, 2019 announcement regarding losses related to winter catastrophe events. The lawsuit alleges that the Company failed to disclose that it did not adequately follow industry best practices related to claims handling and thus did not record sufficient claim reserves, and that as a result, Defendants\u2019 positive statements about the Company\u2019s business, operations and prospects misled investors. Plaintiff seeks, among other things, an undetermined amount of money damages. We believe the lawsuit to be without merit. On February 18, 2020, a motion to dismiss was filed with the court. However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit or estimate the range of loss, if any, that could result from an unfavorable outcome. We also cannot provide any assurance that the ultimate resolution of this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly and be highly volatile and this may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times they find attractive.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations and be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times they find attractive. There are many factors that will impact our stock price and trading volume, including, but not limited to, the factors listed above under \u201cRisks Related to Our Business.\u201d\nStock markets, in general, have experienced in recent years, and continue to experience, significant price and volume volatility, and the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance and prospects. Increased market volatility and fluctuations could result in a substantial decline in the market price of our common stock.\nThe trading volume in our common stock has been limited. As a result, shareholders may not experience liquidity in their investment in our common stock, thereby potentially limiting their ability to resell their shares at the volume, times and prices they find attractive.\nOur common stock is currently traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). Our common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for many other publicly traded insurance and other companies. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. Such stocks can be more volatile than stocks trading in an active public market. Therefore, shareholders have reduced liquidity and may not be able to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times that they desire.\nThere may be future issuances or resales of our common stock which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSubject to any required state insurance regulatory approvals, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock in the future, including securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. Our issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future will dilute the ownership interests of our then existing shareholders.\nWe have an effective registration on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) registering for resale 595,238 shares of our common stock and effective registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering an aggregate of 700,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2005 Equity Participation Plan and an aggregate of 700,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2014 Equity Participation Plan. As of December 31, 2019, options to purchase 82,000 shares of our common stock, and 213,929 shares subject to unvested restricted stock grants, were outstanding under the 2014 plan and 327,900 shares were reserved for issuance thereunder. We have also registered up to $39,290,000 of our securities pursuant to registration statements on Form S-3, which we may sell from time to time in one or more offerings. The shares subject to the registration statements on Form S-3 will be freely tradeable in the public market. In addition, the shares issuable pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-8 will be freely tradable in the public market, except for shares held by our affiliates.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock, whether directly by us, by selling shareholders in future offerings or by our existing shareholders in the secondary market, the perception that such issuances or resales could occur or the availability for future issuances or resale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities on attractive terms or at all.\nIn addition, our board of directors is authorized to designate and issue preferred stock without further shareholder approval, and we may issue other equity and equity-related securities that are senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, to support operations and growth, to maintain our capital ratios, and to comply with any future changes in regulatory standards.\nOur executive officers and directors own a substantial number of shares of our common stock. This will enable them to significantly influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders.\nAs of March 9, 2020, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 990,904 shares of our common stock (including options to purchase 19,500 shares of our common stock and 6,925 shares of our common stock issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock within 60 days), representing 9.2% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nAccordingly, our executive officers and directors, through their beneficial ownership of our common stock, will be able to significantly influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including the election of directors, amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, mergers or other business combination transactions and certain sales of assets outside the usual and regular course of business. The interests of our executive officers and directors may not coincide with the interests of our other shareholders, and they could take actions that advance their own interests to the detriment of our other shareholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions and the regulations to which we may be subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals required under state insurance laws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock. Our certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors may issue up to 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without shareholder approval and with such terms, preferences, rights and privileges as the board of directors may deem appropriate. These provisions, the control of our executive officers and directors over the election of our directors, and other factors may hinder or prevent a change in control, even if the change in control would be beneficial to, or sought by, our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 33770, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "KINS"}
