{"cik": "1003201", "company": "MMA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common shares involves various risks and uncertainties. The risks described in this section are among those that could, directly or indirectly, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as on the value of our common shares.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIncreases in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely affect the fair value of our assets and increase our costs of borrowing.\nInvestments in our bond portfolio and other fixed rate financial instruments that are reported at fair value in our financial statements expose us to changes in interest rates and credit spreads. These instruments include our investments in bonds, loans held-for-sale, loans for which we elected the fair value option and derivative financial instruments.\nInterest rates can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. Interest rates can also fluctuate as a result of geopolitical events or changes in general economic conditions, including events or conditions that alter investor demand for Treasury or other fixed-income securities.\nChanges in market conditions, including changes in interest rates, liquidity, prepayment and/or default expectations, and the level of uncertainty in the market for a particular asset class, may cause fluctuations in credit spreads.\nIf interest rates increase or credit spreads widen, the fair value of our investments in bonds and other fixed rate financial instruments (whose fair value measurements are based upon contractual cash flows) will generally decline and, therefore, have a negative effect on our financial results and net worth. Declines in the fair value of these instruments could be significant in such circumstances.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf short-term interest rates rise, our borrowing costs would increase and our net income would decline as interest payments associated with a significant portion of our debt obligations are indexed to short-term interest rates and, therefore, would increase. However, the Company may, from time to time, enter into agreements with third parties that are designed to manage a portion of this risk.\nChanges in capitalization and interest rates may adversely impact the fair value of our investments in non-performing bonds, investments in subordinate cash flow bonds, certain TRS and other real estate-related investments.\nFor non-performing bonds, subordinate cash flow bonds and certain TRS derivatives that are reported at fair value in our financial statements, the Company measures the fair value of such instruments based upon internally-generated projections over a 10-year investment period of future net operating income from the underlying properties that serve as collateral for such instruments (a terminal value is added to these projections to estimate remaining property value that is expected to be realized at the end of the projection period). In this regard, an increase in capitalization and interest rates would generally cause the fair value of these investments, as well as that of our other direct real estate investments, to decline. Additionally, the value of our real estate-related interests in our LIHTC business line is dependent upon the residual value of multifamily rental properties, which will generally decline if capitalization and discount rates increase.\nThe magnitude of changes in the value of our real estate-related interests could vary from one market to another market as a result of changes in capitalization and discount rates.\nWe are exposed to various risks associated with TRS agreements that we use for financing and other purposes.\nA TRS is an agreement that requires one party to make interest payments based on either a fixed or floating rate of interest in exchange for payments from its counterparty that are based on the return of a referenced asset that is typically an index, a loan or a bond. All payments under this type of agreement are calculated based upon contractually-specified notional amounts. In a typical TRS agreement, we are required to make interest payments that are based on a floating rate of interest and our counterparty is required to make payments to us that reflect the total return associated with a referenced asset. Cash flows associated with this type of agreement are subject to risks associated with the referenced asset (including interest rate and real estate-related risks) and are exposed to the credit risk of both the obligor on the referenced asset and our counterparty to a TRS agreement. To the extent the fair value of a referenced asset declines, we are at risk of having to provide additional collateral to our TRS counterparty. If we were unable to post additional collateral in such circumstances, the referenced asset might be sold at a time when its full value could not be achieved and our existing collateral would be at risk of being retained by our TRS counterparty.\nCash flows from our Bond Portfolio and our other real estate-related investments (for both U.S. Operations and International Operations) are exposed to various risks associated with real estate to which our investments are related.\nBecause a substantial portion of our investments are secured by real estate, or consist of real estate or investments in entities that own real estate, the value of these investments is exposed to various real estate-related risks. Most of these investments are directly or indirectly secured by multifamily rental properties and, therefore, the value of these investments may be adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions or other developments in real estate markets. These factors include (but are not limited to): (i) increasing levels of unemployment and other, adverse regional or national economic conditions; (ii) decreased occupancy and rent levels due to supply and demand imbalances; (iii) changes in interest rates that affect the value of the real estate we own or in which we have an interest; and (iv) lack of or reduced availability of mortgage financing.\nThe value of most of our real estate-related investments is based upon cash flows generated by tenant leases. The majority of the properties that we have financed or in which we have invested have rent limitations that could adversely affect the ability to increase rents. The majority of such properties also have tenant income restrictions that may reduce the number of eligible tenants and, as a result, occupancy rates at such properties could decline. If tenants move out or cannot pay the rents charged on the specific units they lease, the owners (our borrowers and partners) may be unable to lease the units to replacement tenants at full rent (or at all). In such circumstances, cash flows from such properties may not be sufficient to pay interest on our bonds or loans, which would cause the value of our investments to decline.\nReal estate may also decline in value because of adverse changes in market conditions, environmental problems, casualty losses for which insurance proceeds are not sufficient to cover the loss, or condemnation proceedings. The value of our real estate-related investments and our ability to conduct business may also be adversely affected by changes in local or national laws or regulatory conditions that affect significant segments of the real estate market, especially the multifamily housing market, including environmental, land use and other laws and regulations that affect the cost of maintaining and operating the properties in which we have an interest.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are exposed to various risks associated with agreements that we use to manage interest rate risk.\nFrom time to time, we may execute agreements that are designed to reduce our interest rate risk. For example, we may enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to pay a fixed rate of interest and the counterparty agrees to pay us a floating rate of interest in order to synthetically fix our variable rate debt to better match assets that pay on a fixed rate basis. We also may enter into interest rate caps whereby we pay the counterparty on the interest rate cap an upfront premium and the counterparty pays us if the benchmark rate on the cap reaches a certain level. As further discussed above, derivative instruments are exposed to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates. Additionally, interest rate swaps and caps expose the Company to the risk of counterparty default (including counterparty failure to meet its payment obligations). Further, there is a risk that these contracts do not perform as expected and may cost more than the benefits we receive. Moreover, in the case of interest rate swaps, we are exposed to the risk of collateral calls if the fair value of such agreements declines.\nWe may be unable to make new investments in order to grow shareholder value over the long term.\nThere is a risk that we will not be able to deploy our cash or expand our leverage to make investments that generate risk-adjusted returns that sufficiently grow shareholder value. Also, because there are no restrictions as to the nature of our investments, our investments in the future may result in additional or new risks that we do not face today.\nWe face risks associated with our renewable energy finance business.\nOur Energy Capital business line originates development, construction and permanent loans for the Solar Ventures and its own account primarily for the purpose of building commercial scale solar facilities. This business is subject to construction risk, permanent financing and repayment risk and collateral risks (such as value and ability to foreclose). In addition, Federal and State governments have established various incentives and financial mechanisms to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy. These incentives include tax credits, tax abatements and rebates among others. These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in solar energy. Changes in government incentives, whether at the federal or local level, could adversely affect our renewable energy finance business. Furthermore, the ability of the Solar Ventures and the Company to fund our development or construction loan commitments is currently and may become increasingly dependent upon the repayment of other, similar loans that we originated. Repayment of such loans is often dependent upon permanent loans, tax credit equity and other monetization events whose funding is outside of our control since, among other factors, lenders of permanent loans and syndicators of tax credit equity may require access to the credit markets.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, directly and indirectly affected by disruptions in credit markets.\nOur business was significantly affected by the disruptions in the credit markets during the global financial crisis. Disruptions in credit markets may cause significant deterioration in the market for tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other debt instruments that are a major part of our assets and likely to play a significant role in our reinvestment strategy. This has in the past and may in the future result in our having to reduce the carrying value of our bonds and other receivables associated with our lending activities. We are also dependent upon our capital partners to extend existing TRS agreements and other financings upon their maturity. If we were unsuccessful in renewing such agreements, we may be forced to create liquidity in an unfavorable market which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nVirtually all of our non-cash assets are illiquid and may be difficult to sell at their reported carrying values.\nOur bonds, our direct and indirect investments in real estate, our renewable energy investments, and our other debt investments are illiquid and difficult to value. In particular, our investments in bonds are unenhanced and unrated and, as a consequence, there is a relatively small trading market for these instruments. The relative lack of liquidity in the market for our bond investments complicates our ability to measure their fair value and that of other debt investments. Therefore, there is a risk that if we need to sell any of these assets, the price that we are able to realize may be lower than their carrying value in our financial statements.\nSome of our bonds are 30 or more days past due in payment of principal and/or interest and other bond investments are at risk of becoming 30 or more days past due in payment of principal and/or interest.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the aggregate UPB of bonds that were 30 or more days past due in either principal and/or interest was $9.9 million, or approximately 4.4% of our Bond Portfolio. We report our defaulted bonds at their fair value, which takes into consideration a borrower\u2019s default. However, amounts we realize could be even less than such estimates if foreclosures were pursued or if our borrowers filed for bankruptcy protection. Additionally, properties collateralizing certain performing bonds have net operating income (as represented in operating statements provided by the borrowing partnerships), which is less than the debt service owed to us. These bonds are at risk of default if the partners of the borrowing partnerships are unable or unwilling to continue to cover the shortfall in order to pay the full debt service.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe value of our tax-exempt bonds could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws.\nThere is a risk that the government will pass legislation that could adversely affect the value of our tax-exempt bonds. The government could make changes in tax or other laws, such as affordable housing incentive programs, that while not directly affecting our tax-exempt bonds, could make them less valuable to investors. For example, if the federal government were to lower marginal federal income tax rates, or phase out the tax-exempt nature of the interest income for all or higher income taxpayers, our bonds would likely decline in value. Congress could also pass laws that make competing investments more attractive than tax-exempt bonds, which would also make our bonds less valuable.\nOur bonds may not retain their tax-exempt status.\nOn the date of initial issuance of any tax-exempt bond that we hold, bond counsel or special tax counsel has rendered its opinion that interest on the bond is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. However, under certain circumstances, our bonds could lose their tax-exempt status subsequent to issuance. While we take steps to ensure that these circumstances do not occur, there can be no guarantees that the tax-exempt status will be maintained. If our bonds were to lose their tax-exempt status, then the fair value of these investments would decline. In this case, if a bond was the referenced asset in a TRS financing, the TRS would terminate, thereby causing us to reacquire such bonds at fair value while we would also be obligated to pay any difference required to settle a TRS. If we did not purchase a bond in such circumstances, our counterparty could sell it and, if its value at the inception of the TRS agreement was not realized upon sale, we would also be obligated to pay any difference required to settle a TRS agreement and our TRS collateral would be at risk.\nExecuting TRSs are important to our U.S. Operations.\nCurrently, our TRS agreements are with one financial institution. At least in the near term, entering into new TRS agreements, or extending existing agreements, is a significant part of our U.S. Operations. To the extent we are unable to execute these types of agreements in the future, we may be unable to achieve our near term goals and our financial position could suffer significantly.\nWe could lose the tax benefit of our Net Operating Losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d).\nWe have significant deferred tax assets that are fully reserved as of December 31, 2016. The most significant deferred tax asset is our federal NOLs, which can be used to offset federal taxable income for the foreseeable future. However, there are events that could cause us to lose, or to otherwise limit, the amount of NOLs available to us. For example, our NOLs could be lost if we suffer a change of control event as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. A change of control event may occur when a shareholder, or a collection of shareholders, owning at least five percent of our shares, acquire more than 50% of our outstanding shares within a three-year period. The Company adopted a Tax Benefits Rights Agreement on May 5, 2015 (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) in an attempt to avoid a change of control event as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, although the Company cannot guarantee the effectiveness of the Rights Plan. Changes in tax laws could also cause us to lose, or to otherwise limit, the amount of NOLs available to us.\nOur NOLs are also subject to a 20-year carryforward limitation that limits the time that we have to generate the income necessary to fully utilize our NOLs. In this regard, it is possible that some of our NOLs will become permanently impaired if the Company is unable to generate the income required to utilize our NOLs before their expiration period begins in 2027.\nIf we become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), we could be required to sell substantial portions of our assets at a time when we might not otherwise want to do so, and we could incur significant losses as a result.\nWe continuously monitor our business activities to ensure that we do not become subject to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We currently rely on exemptions from the Investment Company Act for companies that are primarily engaged in the business of certain types of financings or of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. Because of changes in the nature and number of companies that rely on the exemption for real estate, as well as given that most of the guidance surrounding this exemption comes from \u201cno action\u201d letters issued by the SEC staff, the SEC on August 31, 2011 issued a concept release requesting comment directed to the scope and use of this exemption. We do not know what action, if any, the SEC may take in response to the comments that it receives. If we were to become regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, either due to a change in the SEC\u2019s interpretation of that Act or due to a significant change in the value and composition of our assets, we would be subject to extensive regulation and restrictions. Among other restrictions, we would not be able to incur borrowings, which would limit our ability to fund certain investments. Accordingly, either we would have to restructure our assets so that we would not be subject to the Investment Company Act or we would have to materially change the way we do business. Either course of action could require that we sell substantial portions of our assets at a time when we might not otherwise want to do so, and we could incur significant losses as a result. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe have provided guarantees with respect to certain of the tax credit equity funds and properties and, if we were to become obligated to perform on those guarantees, our financial condition and results of operation could suffer.\nWithin our LIHTC business line, we have provided a limited guarantee of the expected tax credits to be generated by limited partnership investments held by our LIHTC funds. We have also guaranteed minimum yields on investment to investors in guaranteed LIHTC funds in which we sold our GP interests and agreed to indemnify the purchaser of our GP interests in such funds from investor claims related to those guarantees. We have also agreed to indemnify specific investors in certain non-guaranteed LIHTC funds related to the performance on certain LTPPs. We continue to be obligated on our guarantees to the investors (or purchasers) in these funds and we could be required to make substantial payments with regard to these guarantees. In order for the investors in guaranteed funds to benefit from low-income housing tax credits, the LTPPs in which these funds invest must operate affordable housing properties in compliance with a number of requirements in the Code and the regulations under it. Failure to comply continuously with these requirements throughout a 15-year recapture period could result in loss of the right to those low-income housing tax credits, including recapture of credits that were already taken, potentially creating liability under our guarantees. If we were to become obligated to perform on these guarantees, our financial condition and results of operation would be negatively impacted and the impact could be significant.\nOur ability to maintain and grow our business would be adversely affected if we are unable to partner with institutional capital or if capital partners are unable to meet their funding commitments to us.\nWe need to identify, attract and obtain new capital partners in order to increase the number and size of funds or other businesses that we manage or will manage. In addition, we are dependent on the funding commitments of our existing capital partners. Our ability to partner with institutional capital depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are outside our control. There can be no assurances that we can find or secure commitments from new capital partners or that new or existing capital partners will meet their funding commitments to us. The failure to obtain or maintain partners able to supply capital in sufficient amounts could result in a decrease in management and other fee revenue or a decline in the rate of growth of such fees, any of which could adversely impact our revenues, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe value of our International Operations investments and cash flows could fluctuate with changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar and South African rand (\u201crand\u201d) as well as with changes in benchmark interest rates.\nThe net assets and operations of IHS are denominated in various currencies, although predominantly in the South African rand. In addition, our co-investments in SAWHF and IHS Residential Partners are denominated in rand and the majority of our co-investment in IHS Fund II is denominated in rand. We do not hedge these foreign currency exposures and may experience losses as the value of our holdings in IHS, SAWHF, IHS Residential Partners and IHS Fund II fluctuates with changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, both SAWHF and IHS Fund II SA borrow money in U.S. dollars from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, resulting in those funds having U.S. dollar-to-rand currency risk. SAWHF and IHS Fund II SA also enter into contracts in an effort to hedge foreign currency risk associated with its U.S. dollar-denominated debt. These borrowings and hedges could adversely impact SAWHF\u2019s and IHS Fund II SA\u2019s results and the value of our investments. Additionally, because there are financing arrangements in place for IHS-managed funds and the properties in which the funds have invested, the cost associated with the financing arrangements will change as the respective benchmark interest rate changes. Furthermore, interest rates affect the availability of mortgage financing, which is important for the successful disposition of the funds\u2019 investments. These interest rate changes could adversely impact the value of our investments and cash flows in our International Operations.\nThe value of investments and cash flows of our U.S. and International Operations are dependent on the quality of the management of the underlying properties.\nThe performance of properties in which the funds that we manage have invested or that secure our Bond Portfolio can be adversely impacted by inadequate property management. To the extent property managers are not able to provide quality property management, the value of our investments and the cash flows from these investments will suffer. IHS PM manages a substantial portion of the rental properties in funds that we manage in our International Operations, thereby giving us a significant degree of control over the quality of the management of the underlying properties.\nOur International Operations are exposed to foreign government risk and stability risk.\nForeign governments have different laws and policies than the U.S. government. They may change their laws and policies in ways that harm or limit our operations. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, directly competing with us and nationalizing our operations without providing us with fair compensation. They also may enact laws that make it more difficult for foreign companies to do business, thereby giving local competitors an advantage. South Africa and other countries impose exchange controls that\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nregulate how money enters and leaves the country. These laws could be changed in ways that are adverse to us. Our ability to anticipate, control or counteract these risks is very limited.\nForeign countries have social and economic stability risks that are different than the U.S. South Africa has experienced some social unrest in the past and, should that re-occur or worsen, our operations and investments there could be adversely affected.\nThe application of international tax regimes could substantially affect our after tax results from International Operations.\nIncome we earn abroad is subject to an entirely different set of tax risks than income we earn domestically. We are subject to the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we earn income, or through which our income must move in order for us to receive it in the U.S. International treaties also govern these tax consequences. If any of these laws or treaties changes, it could adversely impact our after-tax results.\nOur International Operations are subject to additional real estate risks compared to that facing our U.S. Operations, including laws and customs related to real estate ownership and finance.\nSAWHF, IHS Residential Partners, IHS Fund II and Transcend invest in real estate in South Africa. While real estate-related risks we face in South Africa are similar to those we face when investing in U.S. real estate markets, there are legal and market differences that result in higher risks that could adversely impact our operations and results. In addition, IHS Fund II has invested in real estate that is located in countries outside of South Africa. In this regard, we have limited experience outside of South Africa and we may face additional risks that we may have not identified and which we are not sufficiently prepared to address.\nOur International Operations include investments in funds that have investments in for-sale units, meaning adverse conditions in the mortgage market could affect the value of those units.\nInvestments made by SAWHF, IHS Residential Partner, and IHS Fund II include for-sale units. If buyers have difficulty obtaining mortgages or other financing, unit sales and, therefore, the value of our interests in these ventures, could be adversely affected.\nWe are at risk of key employee turnover.\nWe are vulnerable to key talent turnover and our business operations could suffer if we were unable to find suitable replacements on a timely basis. This risk is greater than it otherwise would be because our employee headcount is relatively small.\nOur accounting policies and methods require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many of our accounting methods involve substantial use of models, which are based on assumptions, including assumptions about future events. Our management must exercise judgment in applying many of these accounting policies and methods so that these policies and methods comply with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the appropriate accounting policy or method from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances but might affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that we report. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for a description of our significant accounting policies.\nWe have identified three of our accounting policies as critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. These accounting policies are described in \u201cMD&A-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d We believe these policies are critical because they require management to make particularly difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These judgments, by their nature, are based on current facts and circumstances. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates, possibly in the near term, and could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. Even a small change in an estimate can have a significant impact for a reporting period.\nAdditionally, we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. These policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner.\nBecause of the uncertainty surrounding management\u2019s judgments, assumptions and estimates pertaining to these matters, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Shares\nOur Rights Plan could depress our share price.\nUnder the Rights Plan, the acquisition by an investor (or group of related investors) of greater than a 4.9% stake in the Company, could result in all existing shareholders other than the new 4.9% holder having the right to acquire new shares for a nominal cost, thereby significantly diluting the ownership interest of the acquiring person. By discouraging acquisitions of greater than a 4.9% stake in the Company, the Rights Plan might limit takeover opportunities and, as a result, could depress our share price. At December 31, 2016, we had two shareholders with a greater than a 4.9% stake in the Company. Additionally, two employees of the Company would each have a greater than 4.9% stake in the Company for purpose of the Rights Plan to the extent that they exercised their vested option awards as of December 31, 2016. As of the filing date of this Report, the Board of Directors determined that a trigger event has not occurred for purposes of our Rights Plan.\nOur Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) can issue an unlimited number of common or preferred shares, which could reduce our book value per common share and earnings per common share and the cash or other assets available for distribution per common share upon liquidation or otherwise.\nUnder our Operating Agreement, subject to Nasdaq Capital Market rules imposing some limitations on our ability to issue shares without shareholder approval, our Board can authorize the issuance of an unlimited number of common shares without obtaining shareholder approval. Issuances of common shares could dilute the book value or the net income per common share or the cash per share available for distribution to common shareholders. Our Board can also authorize, without any requirement of shareholder approval other than those imposed by Nasdaq Capital Market rules, the issuance of an unlimited number of shares with preferences over the common shares as to dividends, distributions on liquidation and other matters, other than voting. This could reduce the book value and net earnings that would be allocable to our common shares and the cash or other assets that are available for distribution to our common shareholders either periodically or upon our liquidation.\nProvisions of our Operating Agreement may discourage attempts to acquire us.\nOur Operating Agreement contains at least three groups of provisions that could have the effect of discouraging people from trying to acquire control of us. Those provisions are:\n\u00b7\nIf any person or group acquires 10% or more of our shares, that person or group cannot, with a very limited exception, (1) engage in a business combination with us (including an acquisition from us of more than 10% of our assets or more than 5% of our shares) within five years after the person or group acquires the 10% or greater interest, unless our Board approved the business combination or approved the acquisition of a 10% or greater interest in us before it took place, or the business combination is approved by two-thirds of the members of our Board and holders of two-thirds of the shares that are not owned by the person or group that owns the 10% or greater interest; or (2) engage in a business combination with us until more than five years after the person or group acquires the 10% or greater interest, unless the business combination is recommended by our Board and approved by holders of 80% of our shares or of two-thirds of the shares that are not owned by the person or group that owns the 10% or greater interest.\n\u00b7\nIf any person or group makes an acquisition of our shares that causes the person or group to be able to exercise one-fifth or more but less than one-third of all voting power of our shares, one-third or more but less than a majority of all voting power of our shares, or a majority or more of all voting power of our shares, the acquired shares will lose their voting power, except to the extent approved at a meeting by the vote of two-thirds of the shares not owned by the person or group, and we will have the right to redeem, for their fair market value, any of the acquired shares for which the shareholders do not approve voting rights.\n\u00b7\nSince one-third of our directors are elected each year to three-year terms this could delay the time when someone who acquires voting control of us could elect a majority of our directors.\nThe above provisions could deprive our shareholders of opportunities that might be attractive to many of them.\nOur shares are thinly traded and, as a result, the price at which they trade may not reflect their full intrinsic value.\nAlthough we are traded on Nasdaq Capital Market, our shares are thinly traded and we do not have analysts actively tracking and publishing opinions on the Company and our stock. Additionally, when we repurchase our shares, the number of shares outstanding is reduced, which has the effect over time of further decreasing the trading volume of our shares. Accordingly, the trading price of our shares may not reflect their full intrinsic value.", "PERMNO": 83827, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "MMAC"}
