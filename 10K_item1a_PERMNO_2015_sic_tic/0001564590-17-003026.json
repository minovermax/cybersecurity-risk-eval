{"cik": "1274792", "company": "MERRIMACK PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Sale of our Commercial Business to Ipsen\nIf the asset sale is not completed, we may be unable to successfully pursue strategic alternatives for our product candidates.\nIf the asset sale is not completed, we may not be able to pursue strategic alternatives for our company or our product candidates because we will have limited cash reserves and limited revenues. The clinical development and potential commercialization of our product candidates requires significant capital. We had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $21.5 million as of December 31, 2016. If we cannot raise additional capital, we may have difficulty servicing our debt obligations and may need to file for bankruptcy.\nWe may be unable to raise additional capital or may be required to incur significant costs to raise such additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions for debt or equity financing;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates or any other future product candidates;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 and lenders\u2019 belief in our business plan and our ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to comply with our obligations under our existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nthe outcome, timing and cost of regulatory review by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competition; and\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of establishing manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, and these covenants may also require us to attain certain levels of financial performance and we may not be able to do so; any such failure may result in the acceleration of such debt and the foreclosure by our creditors on the collateral we used to secure the debt. If we raise additional funds through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nIf the asset sale is not consummated, we may not be able to commercialize additional product candidates.\nIf the asset sale is not consummated, our commercialization strategy for our product candidates may depend on our ability to enter into agreements with collaborators to obtain assistance and funding for the development and potential commercialization of the relevant product candidate in the territories in which we seek to partner. Despite our efforts, we may be unable to secure additional collaborative licensing or other arrangements that are necessary for us to further develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nSupporting diligence activities conducted by potential collaborators and negotiating the financial and other terms of a collaboration agreement are long, costly and complex processes with uncertain results. Due to our limited cash on hand, we may not have the financial resources to engage in discussions with third parties regarding collaborative licensing or other arrangements.\nWe cannot be sure if or when the asset sale will be completed.\nThe consummation of the asset sale is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the approval of the asset sale by our stockholders. We cannot guarantee that the closing conditions set forth in the asset sale agreement will be satisfied. If we are unable to satisfy the closing conditions in Ipsen\u2019s favor or if other mutual closing conditions are not satisfied, Ipsen will not be obligated to complete the asset sale.\nIf the asset sale is not completed and the asset sale agreement is terminated because our stockholders do not approve the asset sale, we will be required to reimburse up to $3.0 million of Ipsen\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the transaction.\nIf the asset sale is not completed, our board of directors, in discharging its fiduciary obligations to our stockholders, will evaluate other strategic alternatives that may be available, which alternatives may not be as favorable to our stockholders as the asset sale. We may seek another purchaser for the commercial business, but we may not be able to find a purchaser willing to offer a reasonable purchase price for the commercial business. Any future sale of the commercial business or other transactions may be subject to further stockholder approval.\nThe holders of certain of our outstanding convertible securities have asserted that the asset sale constitutes a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d under the indenture that governs those convertible notes.\nIn July 2013, we issued $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% convertible notes due 2020, or convertible notes, of which an aggregate principal amount of $60.8 million remains outstanding as of December 31, 2016. On February 13, 2017, we received a letter on behalf of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as trustee under the convertible notes, at the direction of institutions that own or manage accounts holding more than a majority of the convertible notes, or the majority holders, claiming that the asset sale is a sale of \u201csubstantially all\u201d of our assets and, accordingly, constitutes a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d under the indenture governing the convertible notes, or the convertible notes indenture. The trustee and the majority holders claim that, if the asset sale is a Fundamental Change under the convertible notes indenture, we are obligated to issue a \u201cFundamental Change Issuer Notice\u201d to the holders of the convertible notes and to offer to repurchase the convertible notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest. We disagree with the claims in the letter, including the statement that the asset sale constitutes a sale of \u201csubstantially all\u201d of our assets, and accordingly believe that the asset sale is not a Fundamental Change under the convertible notes indenture. If the majority holders pursue their claim that the asset sale is a sale of \u201csubstantially all\u201d of our assets in litigation, such litigation could be costly to us. If we are unsuccessful in that litigation, we may be required to repay all or a portion of the convertible notes, together with interest thereon. In that event, we would be required to use a portion of the cash proceeds of the asset sale to effect such repayment, which would impact the cash available for other purposes, including the expected dividend to stockholders and the cash to be invested in our oncology pipeline.\nThe announcement and pendency of the asset sale, whether or not consummated, may adversely affect our financial condition or future strategic opportunities.\nThe announcement and pendency of the asset sale, whether or not consummated, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and/or our relationships with partners and employees. In connection with the asset sale, we will be terminating a significant portion of our employees at the closing of the asset sale. In addition, our management\u2019s focus and attention may be diverted from identifying strategic alternatives during the pendency of the asset sale.\nIn the event that the asset sale is not completed, the announcement of the termination of the asset sale agreement may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our relationships with partners and employees.\nThe asset sale agreement limits our ability to sell the commercial business to a party other than Ipsen.\nThe asset sale agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to sell the commercial business to a party other than Ipsen, including a non-solicitation provision and a provision requiring us to notify Ipsen of any solicitation or offer made by any third party in connection with the sale of the commercial business or any similar transaction. These provisions could discourage a third party that might have an interest in acquiring the commercial business from considering or proposing such a transaction, even if that party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the consideration to be paid by Ipsen.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert our attention.\nWe may be subject to securities class action litigation in connection with the asset sale. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from closing the asset sale, which could seriously harm our business.\nBecause our business will be smaller following the sale of the commercial business, there is a possibility that our common stock may be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market if we fail to satisfy the continued listing standards.\nEven though we currently satisfy the continued listing standards for the NASDAQ Global Market, following the completion of the sale of the commercial business, our business will be smaller and, therefore, we may fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Market. In the event that we are unable to satisfy the continued listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Market, our common stock may be delisted. Any delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Global Market could adversely affect our ability to attract new investors, decrease the liquidity of our outstanding shares of common stock, reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital, reduce the price at which our common stock trades and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares with overall negative effects for our stockholders. In addition, delisting of our common stock could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our common stock, and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our securities at all. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect the price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause the commercial business represented all of our revenues for fiscal year 2016, our business following the sale of the commercial business will be substantially different.\nThe commercial business represented all of our revenues for the fiscal year 2016. Following the sale of the commercial business, we will retain the pipeline business. Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially affected if we fail to grow our pipeline business, if we are unable to raise additional capital if needed to run the pipeline business, if we must incur significant costs in order to raise additional capital to run the pipeline business or if we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize our remaining product candidates.\nThere can be no guarantee that Ipsen will comply with its obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts in connection with the development of ONIVYDE.\nIf the asset sale is completed, Ipsen has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop ONIVYDE in connection with obtaining the regulatory approval by the FDA of ONIVYDE for certain indications. Although the results of this approval process may enable Ipsen to achieve the milestones necessary for us to receive the contingent payments under the asset sale agreement, there is no guarantee that Ipsen will take the steps set forth in the asset sale agreement and that such development will lead to the successful approval of ONIVYDE for such additional indications. Therefore, there can be no guarantees that any of the milestones set forth in the asset sale agreement will be achieved and that we will receive any future contingent payments.\nWhether or not the asset sale is completed, we are entitled to receive certain net milestone payments under the Baxalta agreement, up to $33.0 million. Even though Baxalta and we have made progress towards achieving these milestones, payment of any or all of the $33.0 million is not guaranteed.\nWe cannot predict the timing or amount of any distributions to our stockholders.\nAfter consummation of the asset sale, we plan to issue a special cash dividend to stockholders of at least $200.0 million. This dividend amount assumes that we will not use any of the proceeds of the asset sale to repay our outstanding convertible notes. We cannot predict the exact timing or amount of the dividend at this time, or the potential outcome of any potential litigation challenging our position that we are not obligated to repurchase the convertible notes. In addition, our board of directors will need to approve the dividend if and after the asset sale is consummated, and will only authorize a dividend if there is sufficient surplus at that time. In the event there is not sufficient surplus, we may be unable to pay the expected dividend or any dividend.\nIf the asset sale disrupts our business operations and prevents us from realizing intended benefits, our business may be harmed.\nThe asset sale may disrupt the operation of our business and prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of the asset sale as a result of a number of obstacles, including the loss of key employees, customers or business partners, the failure to adjust or implement our business strategies, additional expenditures required to facilitate the asset sale and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day operations.\nIpsen is not assuming any of the excluded liabilities under the asset sale agreement.\nPursuant to the asset sale agreement, if the asset sale is completed, Ipsen will only assume certain specified liabilities set forth in the asset sale agreement and will not assume all of the liabilities associated with the commercial business. Certain liabilities will remain with us post-closing. While we believe that we have adequately accrued for these liabilities or are adequately insured against certain of the risks associated with such excluded liabilities, there can be no assurances that additional expenditures will not be incurred in resolving these liabilities.\nThe asset sale agreement may expose us to contingent liabilities.\nWe have agreed to indemnify Ipsen for certain breaches of representations, warranties or covenants made by us in the asset sale agreement and for certain specified existing litigation. We have agreed that if we cannot pay our indemnification obligations, Ipsen will have set-off rights against any future contingent payments. Significant indemnification claims by Ipsen could further materially and adversely affect our financial condition and/or significantly reduce any future contingent payments.\nWe will continue to incur the expenses of complying with public company reporting requirements following the closing of the asset sale.\nAfter the asset sale, we will continue to be a public company. For as long as we remain a public company, we have an obligation to continue to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which include the filing with the SEC of periodic reports, proxy statements and other documents relating to our business, financial condition and other matters, even though compliance with such reporting requirements is economically burdensome.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $153.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, $147.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $83.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $954.8 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our convertible preferred stock, collaborations, public offerings of our securities, secured debt financings and sales of ONIVYDE. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials and recently to commercialization of our first product, ONIVYDE. We have not completed development of or commercialized any other therapeutic product candidates or diagnostics other than ONIVYDE. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years as we:\n\u2022\ninitiate or continue clinical trials of our most advanced product candidates;\n\u2022\ncontinue the research and development of our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek to discover additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; and\n\u2022\ncontinue to provide the operational, financial and management information systems and personnel to support our product development and continued commercialization.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and commercializing products with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including discovering product candidates, completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling or partnering those products for which we may seek and receive regulatory approval. We are only in the preliminary stages of some of these activities for most of our product candidates, and our commercial activities for ONIVYDE are still at an early stage. We may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment.\nOur substantial indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business.\nWe currently have, and will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. In July 2013, we issued $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes, of which an aggregate principal amount of $60.8 million remains outstanding as of December 31, 2016, and in December 2015, we issued $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 11.50% senior secured notes due 2022, or 2022 notes. Additionally, in November 2016, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the credit agreement, with BioPharma Credit Investments IV Sub, LP, or Pharmakon, pursuant to which a credit facility of an aggregate principal amount of at least $15.0 million and up to $25.0 million is available to us at any time through April 27, 2017, upon compliance with certain funding conditions. In connection with the credit agreement, we granted Pharmakon a security interest in all inventory and accounts receivable. We could in the future incur additional indebtedness beyond such amounts.\nOur substantial debt combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have significant adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on, and principal of, our debt, which will reduce the amounts available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nobligating us to restrictive covenants that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions or obtain further debt or equity financing;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options.\nWe intend to satisfy our current and future debt service obligations with our existing cash and cash equivalents and funds from external sources, and, upon consummation of the asset sale to Ipsen, we intend to prepay the 2022 notes. However, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay any amounts due under our debt as it exists at any future point in time. Funds from external sources may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, a failure to comply with the covenants under our existing debt instruments could result in an event of default under those instruments. In the event of an acceleration of amounts due under our debt instruments as a result of an event of default, including upon the occurrence of an event that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, properties, assets or condition or a failure to pay any amount due, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness or to make any accelerated payments, and the lenders could seek to enforce security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness. In addition, the covenants under our existing debt instruments and the pledge of our assets as collateral limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our obligations.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We currently do not generate cash flow from operations and, in the future, our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity or debt financing on terms that may be unfavorable to us or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities at all or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations or future indebtedness.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. We expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates. In addition, in connection with supporting commercial sales of ONIVYDE through the time at which the asset sale is consummated, if ever, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution related to ONIVYDE and any other product for which we obtain regulatory approval in the future. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts.\nUpon stockholder approval and the closing of the asset sale with Ipsen, we will receive a $575.0 million upfront cash payment from Ipsen (subject to a working capital adjustment as provided in the asset sale agreement). We expect to use these proceeds to declare and pay a special cash dividend of at least $200.0 million to stockholders and redeem the $175.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2022 notes, which will require an additional make-whole premium payment of approximately $20.1 million. Additionally, if the asset sale is consummated and certain milestones under the Baxalta agreement are met, we currently expect to receive up to an aggregate of $33.0 million in net milestone payments in 2017. We believe these potential net cash inflows, along with the completion of the headcount reduction and refocused research and development efforts that were announced in January 2017, will provide financial resources sufficient to fund our operations into the second half of 2019. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, and the extent to which we utilize collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe consummation of the asset sale and the net proceeds received therefrom;\n\u2022\nthe amount of net product revenues realized from ONIVYDE commercial sales, should the asset sale not be consummated;\n\u2022\nthe amount of royalty and profit sharing revenue from our collaboration partners, particularly should the asset sale not be consummated;\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of the clinical trials of our most advanced product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe success of the Baxalta and PharmaEngine collaborations related to ONIVYDE and any future collaborations with other parties that we may enter into;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of anticipated milestone payments and cost sharing reimbursements related to ONIVYDE that we may receive from Baxalta;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of future milestone payments that we may receive from Ipsen under the asset sale agreement;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our current and future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs of commercial activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, particularly should the asset sale not be consummated;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements for the manufacture of drug product on behalf of third-party pharmaceutical companies, particularly should the asset sale not be consummated; and\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations on favorable terms, particularly marketing and distribution arrangements for oncology product candidates outside the United States and Europe.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data required to obtain regulatory approval and, even if regulatory approval is obtained, achieve product sales of any of our product candidates other than ONIVYDE. In addition, ONIVYDE or any of our other\nproduct candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. We began commercializing ONIVYDE under the brand name ONIVYDE in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2015. If we fail to generate sufficient revenues from the sale of ONIVYDE or the commercialization of any of our product candidates, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.\nIf we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of the asset sale and the transaction with Ipsen is not consummated, or if we are unable to obtain other adequate financing or engage in another strategic transaction on acceptable terms and when needed, we will be required to implement further cost reduction strategies.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our losses from operations and required additional funding to finance our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nWe do not have any committed external source of funds, other than under the asset sale agreement with Ipsen, which is subject to the achievement of certain closing conditions prior to consummation, including stockholder approval, under our collaboration with Baxalta for the development and commercialization of ONIVYDE, which is terminable by Baxalta for convenience upon 180 days\u2019 prior written notice, under our development, license and supply agreement with Actavis, which is terminable by Actavis for convenience in specified circumstances upon 90 days\u2019 prior written notice, and under our credit agreement with Pharmakon, subject to compliance with certain funding conditions. Other sources of funds may not be available or, if available, may not be available on terms satisfactory to us and could result in significant stockholder dilution.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate sufficient product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. We also could engage in discussions with third parties regarding partnerships, joint ventures, combinations or divestitures of one or more of our businesses as we seek to further the development of our research programs, improve our cash position and maximize stockholder value. There can be no assurance as to the timing, terms or consummation of any financing, collaboration, licensing arrangement or other marketing and distribution arrangement, partnership, joint venture, combination or divestiture.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, and these covenants may also require us to attain certain levels of financial performance and we may not be able to do so; any such failure may result in the acceleration of such debt and the foreclosure by our creditors on the collateral we used to secure the debt. The debt issued in a debt financing would also be senior to our outstanding shares of capital stock, and may rank equally with or senior to the convertible notes and the 2022 notes, upon our liquidation. Our existing indebtedness and the pledge of our assets as collateral limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. If we raise additional funds through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur investments are subject to risks that could result in losses.\nWe invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments, principally securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, investment grade corporate bonds, including commercial paper, and money market instruments. All of these investments are subject to\ncredit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk. Such risks, including the failure or severe financial distress of the financial institutions that hold our cash, cash equivalents and investments, may result in a loss of liquidity, impairment to our investments, realization of substantial future losses, or a complete loss of the investments in the long-term, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In order to manage the risk to our investments, we maintain an investment policy that, among other things, limits the amount that we may invest in any one issue or any single issuer and requires us to only invest in high credit quality securities.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe depend heavily on the successful commercialization of ONIVYDE and the success of our clinical stage product candidates. All of our product candidates other than ONIVYDE are still in preclinical and clinical development. Clinical trials of our product candidates may not be successful. If we are unable to successfully commercialize ONIVYDE or our other product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of ONIVYDE and our other clinical stage product candidates for the treatment of various types of cancer. All of our product candidates, including ONIVYDE in indications beyond those for which it has already received marketing approval, are still in preclinical and clinical development. Our ability to generate meaningful product revenues will depend heavily on the successful commercialization of ONIVYDE and development of our product candidates. The success of ONIVYDE and our product candidates, which include both our therapeutic product candidates and diagnostic candidates, will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nsuccessful enrollment in, and completion of, preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nreceipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States for our product candidates, including our diagnostics;\n\u2022\nestablishing commercial manufacturing capabilities, either by building such facilities ourselves or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022\nlaunching commercial sales of any approved products, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022\nacceptance of any approved products by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022\neffectively competing with other therapies;\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety profile of any products following approval; and\n\u2022\nqualifying for, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize ONIVYDE and our other product candidates, which would materially harm our business.\nFor example, in connection with our strategic review of our pipeline which was completed in January 2017, we amended several of our clinical trials such as our Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-121 and our Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-141, resulting in changes to their power, design and timing, and also discontinued several trials, including our Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-302.\nEven though the ONIVYDE regimen has been approved for marketing by the FDA, European Commission and certain other regulatory agencies, we or Baxalta may never receive approval to commercialize ONIVYDE in other parts of the world.\nWe have out-licensed the rights for the development and commercialization of ONIVYDE outside of the United States and Taiwan. In order to market our products outside of the United States, we or our collaboration partners must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other jurisdictions regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve product testing and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States. Potential risks include that the regulatory authorities may not:\n\u2022\ndeem our products safe and effective;\n\u2022\nfind the data from clinical trials sufficient to support approval;\n\u2022\napprove of manufacturing processes and facilities; or\n\u2022\napprove our products for any or all indications for which approval is sought.\nIf ONIVYDE fails to receive marketing approval in other parts of the world, our business may be materially harmed.\nIf clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nEven though ONIVYDE has been approved for marketing by the FDA, European Commission and certain other regulatory agencies in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy, we may never receive approval to commercialize our other product candidates in the United States or other jurisdictions, or to commercialize ONIVYDE in other parts of the world or for other indications. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and successful interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict successful final results.\nWe may experience numerous unexpected events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate or patients may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nwe might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding of a lack of clinical response or a finding that the patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates, diagnostics or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022\nour product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators to suspend or terminate the trials.\nFor example, in December 2016, we decided to discontinue our Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-302 in combination with trastuzumab in patients with ErbB2 (HER2) positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer based on an opinion from the DSMB that continuing the clinical trial would be unlikely to demonstrate benefit over the comparator treatments. We do not plan to invest in additional development of MM-302 at this time. Previously, in our Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-121 in patients with NSCLC, two of the three cohorts (Groups A and C) failed to meet their primary endpoints, and the third cohort (Group B) did not pass its planned interim analysis and ceased enrolling patients. Additionally, we did not meet the primary endpoints in our previous Phase 2 clinical trials of MM-121 in patients with ovarian cancer or in patients with breast cancer, although our ongoing biomarker analysis in each trial identified a potential subpopulation of patients benefiting from MM-121 in combination with either paclitaxel or exemestane, respectively.\nPreclinical and clinical data may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended;\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u2022\nbe subject to restrictions on how the product is distributed or used; or\n\u2022\nbe unable to obtain reimbursement for use of the product.\nDelays in testing or approvals may result in increases to our product development costs. We do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all.\nSignificant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf serious adverse or undesirable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates or following their approval and commercialization, we may need to modify or abandon our development or marketing of such product or product candidate.\nAll of our product candidates, other than ONIVYDE in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy, are still in preclinical or clinical development and their risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval, and it is impossible to ensure that safety or efficacy issues will not arise following regulatory approval. Currently marketed therapies for solid tumors are generally limited to some extent by their toxicity. Use of our product candidates as monotherapies in clinical trials also has resulted in adverse events consistent in nature with other marketed therapies. When used in combination with other marketed or investigational therapies, our product candidates may exacerbate adverse events associated with the other therapy. If our products or product candidates, either alone or in combination with other therapies, result in undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to modify or abandon their development or marketing. For instance, the label for ONIVYDE contains a boxed warning with respect to severe neutropenia and severe diarrhea, which must be clearly conveyed in all marketing materials. Physicians\u2019 perceptions of the risks conveyed by the ONIVYDE boxed warning could impact their willingness to prescribe ONIVYDE.\nIf we experience delays in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials to obtain a statistically significant result as required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. In addition, many of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates. Patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates or rely upon treatment with existing therapies that may preclude them from eligibility for our clinical trials.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of the company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any of our current or future clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nIn general, we forecast enrollment for our clinical trials based on experience from previous clinical trials and monitor enrollment to be able to make adjustments to clinical trials when appropriate, including as a result of slower than expected enrollment that we experience from time to time in our clinical trials. For example, we experienced slower than expected enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-121 in combination with exemestane for hormone receptor positive breast cancer. In response, we revised the\nentry criteria for the clinical trial to correspond with changes in clinical practice and also expanded the number of sites and countries participating in the clinical trial. It is possible that slow enrollment in other clinical trials in the future could require us to make similar adjustments. If these adjustments do not overcome problems with slow enrollment, we could experience significant delays or abandon the applicable clinical trial altogether.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop diagnostics for our therapeutic product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, we may not realize the full commercial potential of our therapeutics.\nAn important component of our business strategy is to develop, either alone or together with third parties, in vitro or in vivo diagnostics for each of our therapeutic product candidates. There has been limited success to date industry-wide in developing diagnostics, in particular in vitro diagnostics. To be successful, we will need to address a number of scientific, technical, regulatory and logistical challenges.\nAll of our diagnostic candidates are in preclinical or clinical development. We have limited experience in the development of diagnostics and may not be successful in developing appropriate diagnostics to pair with any of our therapeutic product candidates that receive marketing approval. The FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States are generally expected to regulate in vitro companion diagnostics as medical devices and in vivo companion diagnostics as drugs. In each case, companion diagnostics require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. Given our limited experience in developing diagnostics, we expect to rely in part on third parties for their design, development and manufacture. If we, or any third parties that we engage to assist us, are unable to successfully develop diagnostics for our therapeutic product candidates, or experience delays in doing so, the development of our therapeutic product candidates may be adversely affected, our therapeutic product candidates may not receive marketing approval and we may not realize the full commercial potential of any therapeutics that receive marketing approval. As a result, our business would be harmed, possibly materially.\nAny of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven though ONIVYDE has received marketing approval, it, or any of our other product candidates that receive marketing approval, may nonetheless not gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of ONIVYDE and our other product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors that may be uncertain or subjective, including:\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nefficacy and potential advantages or disadvantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe price we charge for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop diagnostics that effectively identify patient populations likely to benefit from treatment with our therapeutic products;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support; and\n\u2022\nsufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nIf we are unable to effectively educate healthcare professionals or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our products, we may not be successful in commercializing ONIVYDE or any other product candidates for which we receive marketing approval.\nONIVYDE is the first product that we are commercializing. We have no prior experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of therapeutic products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either build a field organization or outsource this function to third parties. We have established an organization to educate healthcare professionals on ONIVYDE in the United States. We expect that Baxalta and PharmaEngine will market and sell ONIVYDE in the rest of the world in jurisdictions where ONIVYDE is approved. Our commercialization plans for our other therapeutic candidates will depend in part on any future collaborations into which we may enter.\nThere are risks involved with both establishing our own commercial capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, we have a small field force of clinically trained professionals who are charged with educating healthcare professionals about ONIVYDE and Merrimack. This differs from the traditional field model in that it is neither a traditional field sales force nor a traditional medical science liaison role. While we believe that our field strategy will better meet the needs of our customers, this strategy may not be effective.\nWe also may not be successful entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or doing so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new therapeutic and diagnostic products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to ONIVYDE and our other product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Several large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies currently market and sell products for the treatment of the solid tumor indications for which we are developing our product candidates. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Many of these competitors are attempting to develop therapeutics for our target indications.\nWe are developing our product candidates for the treatment of solid tumors. There are a variety of available therapies marketed for solid tumors. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis, including the active ingredients in ONIVYDE. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. This may make it difficult for us to achieve our business strategy of replacing existing therapies with our product candidates.\nThere are also a number of products in late stage clinical development to treat solid tumors. Our competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render ONIVYDE or our other product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. There are many generic products currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nONIVYDE or any of our product candidates that we successfully commercialize may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new therapeutic and diagnostic products, including ONIVYDE, vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval.\nOur ability to commercialize ONIVYDE and any other approved products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and managed care organizations. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. The federal government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as ONIVYDE and the other product candidates that we are developing and could have a material adverse effect our net revenue and results.\nThird-party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement and co-pay levels. The growing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Even with clinical trials, our product candidates may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than other products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our products or any of our product candidates that we commercialize, in whole or in part.\nThe process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication, and a payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.\nWe cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, ONIVYDE and any other product for which we obtain marketing approval. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with products administered under the supervision of a physician. In addition, coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. Thus, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may also suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize ONIVYDE or any other product candidate that we successfully develop.\nPayors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. CMS surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the NADAC files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. Changes in these reimbursement mechanisms may have an adverse effect on our revenue.\nMoreover, there may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for ONIVYDE and any other approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries. Eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Payment rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future weakening of laws that presently restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and appropriate payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for new products that we develop could therefore have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products, and our overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of ONIVYDE and any other products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and an even greater risk related to the commercial sale of ONIVYDE and any other products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that ONIVYDE or our other product candidates caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for ONIVYDE or any other products or product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of patients from clinical trials;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently hold $10.0 million in product liability insurance coverage, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any or every liability that may arise.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.\nWe have based our research and development efforts on our systems biology approach to biomedical research. Notwithstanding our large investment to date and anticipated future expenditures in our proprietary approach to research and development, we may fail to address or develop product candidates or indications based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe also may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover new or additional product candidates through our systems biology approach. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have otherwise been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\nWe plan to establish separately funded companies for the development of product candidates using our systems biology approach in some areas outside the oncology field. These companies may not be successful in the development and commercialization of any product candidates.\nWe plan to apply our systems biology approach to multiple additional disease areas outside the oncology field. We expect to do so in some cases through the establishment of separately funded companies. For example, we established Silver Creek to research and develop regenerative medicines to repair the heart using our systems biology approach. Silver Creek has received separate funding from investors other than us. Although we were the majority owner of Silver Creek as of December 31, 2016, in the future we may not be the majority owner of or control Silver Creek or other companies that we establish. If in the future we do not control Silver Creek\nor any future similar company that we establish, Silver Creek or such other companies could take actions that we do not endorse or with which we disagree, such as using our systems biology approach in a way that reflects adversely on us. In addition, these companies may have difficulty raising additional funds and could encounter any of the risks in developing and commercializing product candidates to which we are subject.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We also store certain low level radioactive waste at our facilities until the materials can be properly disposed of. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage, use or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may be required to incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could substantially increase the costs of our clinical trial programs.\nA significant portion of our clinical trial activities are conducted outside of the United States, and associated costs may be incurred in the local currency of the country in which the trial is being conducted, which costs could be subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. At present, we do not engage in hedging transactions to protect against uncertainty in future exchange rates between particular foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against currencies in geographies in which we conduct clinical trials could have a negative impact on our research and development costs. We cannot predict the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and foreign currency fluctuations in the future may adversely affect our development costs.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nThe successful commercialization and continued development of ONIVYDE depends substantially on our collaboration with Baxalta. If Baxalta is unable or unwilling to commercialize or further develop ONIVYDE, or experiences significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nIn September 2014, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Baxalta for the development and commercialization of ONIVYDE. Prior to this collaboration, we did not have a history of working with Baxalta, nor do we have a history of working with Shire plc, which acquired Baxalta in June 2016. The collaboration involves a complex allocation of rights, provides for milestone payments to us based on the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sale milestones, and provides us with royalty-based revenue if ONIVYDE is successfully commercialized. We cannot predict the success of the collaboration.\nUnder our license and collaboration agreement, Baxalta has significant control over the conduct and timing of development and commercialization efforts with respect to ONIVYDE outside of the United States. We have little control over the amount, timing and quality of resources that Baxalta devotes to the development or commercialization of ONIVYDE outside of the United States. If Baxalta fails to devote sufficient financial and other resources to the future development or commercialization of ONIVYDE outside of the United States, the development and commercialization of ONIVYDE outside of the United States would be delayed or could fail. This would result in a delay in our receiving milestone payments or royalties with respect to ONIVYDE outside of the United States or in our not receiving such milestone payments or royalties at all.\nIf we lose Baxalta as a collaborator in the development or commercialization of ONIVYDE, our business will be materially harmed.\nBaxalta has the right to terminate our agreement for the development and commercialization of ONIVYDE, in whole or with respect to specified territories, at any time and for any reason, upon 180 days\u2019 prior written notice. Baxalta also has the right to terminate our agreement if we fail to cure a material breach of our agreement within a specified cure period, or fail to diligently pursue a cure if such a breach is not curable within such period.\nIf Baxalta terminates our agreement at any time, whether on the basis of our uncured material breach or for any other reason, it would delay or prevent our further development of ONIVYDE and materially harm our business and could accelerate our need for additional capital. In particular, we would have to fund the future clinical development and commercialization of ONIVYDE outside of the United States on our own, seek another collaborator or licensee for such clinical development and commercialization, or abandon the future clinical development and commercialization of ONIVYDE outside of the United States.\nAdditionally, in June 2016, Baxalta was acquired by Shire plc. The change of control of Baxalta may adversely affect our collaborative relationship or the commercialization of ONIVYDE in the partnered territories. Such a change in control may result in a reprioritization of ONIVYDE within Baxalta\u2019s portfolio, or Baxalta failing to maintain the financial or other resources necessary to continue supporting its commercialization of ONIVYDE.\nWe may depend on collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nDepending on our capital requirements, development and commercialization costs, need for additional therapeutic expertise and other factors, it is possible that we will enter into additional development and commercialization arrangements with respect to either oncology product candidates or product candidates in other therapeutic areas. In particular, while we expect to apply our systems biology approach to other disease areas through arrangements similar to Silver Creek, it is also possible that we will seek to enter into licensing agreements or other types of collaborations for the application of our systems biology approach.\nOur likely collaborators for any distribution, marketing, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. We will have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our product candidates, including our collaboration with Baxalta, pose the following risks to us:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and the collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated, such as the termination of our license and collaboration agreement with Sanofi effective December 17, 2014, and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development plans.\nOur product development programs, the commercialization of ONIVYDE and the potential commercialization of any other approved product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may also be restricted under existing collaboration agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with other potential collaborators. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. If that were to occur, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenue.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe do not independently conduct clinical trials of our product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to perform this function. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. We remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA and other international regulatory agencies require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that adverse event data are reported within required timeframes, that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of patients in clinical trials are protected. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future distributors could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products or cause us to incur additional costs, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe also intend to utilize diagnostics in several of our current and planned clinical trials, including current clinical trials of MM-121 and MM-141, to preselect patients who will receive specified treatment regimens. We will rely on third-party laboratories to test patient samples in connection with such diagnostics. Any failure on the part of these laboratories to properly perform such testing could jeopardize those clinical trials and delay or prevent the approval of the associated therapeutic candidate.\nRisks Related to the Manufacturing of Our Product Candidates\nWe have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates, and any interruption in manufacturing could result in insufficient drug product to meet our clinical development and commercial requirements.\nWe have a manufacturing facility located at our corporate headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We manufacture drug substance at this facility that we use for commercial sales of ONIVYDE, research and development purposes and for clinical trials of our product candidates. We have limited experience in manufacturing products at a commercial scale. If we are unable to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements or retain necessary manufacturing personnel, we may encounter delays or additional costs in achieving our research, development and commercialization objectives, including in obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates, which could materially damage our business and financial position.\nIf our manufacturing facility is damaged or destroyed or production at this facility is otherwise interrupted, our business and prospects would be negatively affected and our commercialization efforts may be materially harmed.\nIf the manufacturing facility at our corporate headquarters or the equipment in it is damaged or destroyed, we may not be able to quickly or economically replace our manufacturing capacity or replace it at all. If such an event occurs, the supply of ONIVYDE and our other product candidates would be interrupted. In the event of a temporary or protracted loss of this facility or equipment, we might not be able to transfer manufacturing to a third party and could lose potential revenue from the sales of ONIVYDE and any other products for which we obtain regulatory approval. Even if we could transfer manufacturing to a third party, the shift would likely be expensive and time-consuming, particularly since the new facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements and we would need FDA approval before selling ONIVYDE or any other products manufactured at that facility. Such an event could delay our clinical trials or reduce our product sales of ONIVYDE and any other products that are approved by the FDA.\nCurrently, we maintain insurance coverage against damage to our property and equipment and to cover business interruption and research and development restoration expenses. If we have underestimated our insurance needs with respect to an interruption in our clinical manufacturing of our product candidates, we may not be able to cover our losses.\nAny other interruption of production at our manufacturing facility also could damage our business. For example, in 2009, we experienced a viral contamination at this facility that required that we shut the facility entirely for decontamination. Because of this contamination, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on our IND for MM-121 until we submitted supporting documentation to the FDA regarding our decontamination procedures. Although we were able to resolve this issue, with the FDA lifting the partial clinical hold in April 2010, other companies have experienced similar contamination problems, and we could experience a similar problem in the future that is more difficult to resolve.\nWe expect to continue to contract with third parties for at least some aspects of the production of ONIVYDE and our other product candidates for commercial sale and clinical trials. This increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of ONIVYDE or our other product candidates at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe currently rely on third-party manufacturers for some aspects of the production of ONIVYDE and our other product candidates, including the production of MM-121 and fill-finish and labeling activities for ONIVYDE and our other product candidates. In addition, while we believe that our existing manufacturing facility or additional facilities that we build will be sufficient to meet our requirements for manufacturing a significant portion of drug substance for our research and development activities, we may need to rely on third-party manufacturers for some of these requirements, particularly later stage clinical trials of our antibody product candidates, and, at least in the near term, for commercial supply of ONIVYDE and any other products for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn connection with the termination of our license and collaboration agreement with Sanofi for the development and commercialization of MM-121 in 2014, we assumed an agreement with a third-party manufacturer for the manufacture of MM-121. We do not have any other agreements with third-party manufacturers for the clinical supply to us of ONIVYDE or commercial supply to us of ONIVYDE or any other product candidates, and we may be unable to conclude such agreements or to do so on acceptable terms. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party; and\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP or QSR or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products and product candidates.\nAny products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. Because there are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP or QSR regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us, we may not have access to such manufacturers.\nWe currently rely on single suppliers for certain raw materials that we use for our nanoliposome manufacturing process. We purchase these materials from our suppliers on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply agreements in place. Any performance failure or refusal to supply on the part of our existing or future suppliers could delay clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization of our products. If our current suppliers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace one or more of these suppliers. Although we believe that there may be a number of potential long-term replacements to each supplier, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacements.\nWe likely will rely upon third-party manufacturers to provide us with necessary reagents and instruments to develop, test and manufacture our in vitro diagnostics. Currently, many reagents are marketed as Research Use Only products under FDA regulations.\nOur potential future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe rely on third parties to perform various tasks related to the manufacturing of our product candidates. Compliance by such third parties with regulations of the FDA or other regulatory bodies cannot be assured, which could adversely impact our ability to supply our product candidates.\nAlthough we perform much of the bulk manufacturing for ONIVYDE and our other product candidates, we rely on third parties to perform the fill-finish and packaging steps. If any of those third parties were to fail to be in compliance with regulations of the FDA or other regulatory bodies, our ability to supply ONIVYDE and our other product candidates could be adversely impacted.\nFor instance, in 2010, a former fill-finish third-party contractor that we used to fill and package MM-121 experienced FDA inspection issues with its quality control processes that resulted in a formal warning letter from the FDA. As a result, we pulled some MM-121 from clinical trial sites and replaced it with MM-121 that was filled by a different contractor. This restocking resulted in a few patients missing one or two doses of MM-121. It is possible that we could experience similar issues with other contractors.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to fulfill our obligations under our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of intellectual property license agreements with third parties, including with respect to MM-121, MM-141, MM-302 and MM-151, and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that our future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop and market any product that is covered by these agreements. Termination of these licenses or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms. The occurrence of such events could materially harm our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or products that we license from them, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. In some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or products that we license from third parties. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a\nmanner consistent with the best interests of our business. In addition, if third parties who license patents to us fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nWe have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors\u2019 pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or products or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. Under the America Invents Act enacted in 2011, the United States moved to this first to file system in 2013 from the previous system under which the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent. We may become involved in opposition, interference or derivation proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to initiate infringement lawsuits, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the enforceable proprietary rights of third parties. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties can have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to our patented technology and products, we rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. In addition, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to obtain, maintain or protect proprietary rights necessary for the continued development and commercialization of our products, product candidates and research technologies, including as a result of challenges from companies who seek to sell generic versions of ONIVYDE after expiration of our orphan drug exclusivity but prior to our ONIVYDE patent expiration.\nOur commercial success depends in large part on obtaining and maintaining U.S. and foreign patent protection for our products, our product candidates and our research technologies and successfully enforcing and defending these patents against third-party challenges, including with respect to generic challenges. The validity of our patents in one or more jurisdictions may be challenged by third parties, resulting in our patents being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, which could compromise the scope or duration of our exclusive rights in the relevant product, product candidate or technology. For example, the validity of a U.S. patent can be challenged in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (e.g., through an Inter Partes Review and/or Post Grant Review Proceeding) and/or in U.S. federal district court.\nIn addition, our patents on ONIVYDE may also be challenged in a federal court in connection with a third party\u2019s ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA seeking FDA approval to market a generic version of ONIVYDE, resulting in a patent challenge to one or more patents listed in the Orange Book for ONIVYDE. This patent challenge can result in one or more of those Orange Book patents for ONIVYDE being deemed uninfringed, invalid, unenforceable and/or narrowed in scope, which could compromise the scope or duration of our exclusive rights in the relevant product. An ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be filed at any time after FDA approval of ONIVYDE. Other challenges to a patent may be mounted without regard to the date of an FDA approval.\nOur patents as issued or as subsequently limited by any litigation might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from circumventing our patent protection and utilizing our technologies. For instance, the issued patents relating to ONIVYDE and our product candidates may be limited to a particular indication and/or composition and may not cover similar compositions that have similar clinical properties. Consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Also, our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents. We cannot be sure that our patents and patent applications, including our own and those that we have rights to under licenses from third parties, will adequately protect our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including, among other things, the following: (i) the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions; (ii) the actual protection afforded by a patent can vary from country to country and may depend upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country; (iii) the laws of foreign countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection to our intellectual property, thereby easing our competitors' ability to compete with us in such countries; (iv) intellectual property laws and regulations and legal standards relating to the validity, scope and enforcement of patents covering pharmaceutical and biotechnological inventions are continually developing and changing, both in the United States and in other important markets outside the United States; (v) third parties may challenge, infringe, circumvent or seek to invalidate existing or future patents owned by or licensed to us; and (vi) the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and, as a consequence, our and our partners' patent applications may result in patents with narrower coverage than we desire or have planned for.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nIf we are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates, including our clinical stage product candidates, and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, import, export, sampling and marketing are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. On October 22, 2015, we received approval from the FDA and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration to market ONIVYDE in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy in the United States and Taiwan, respectively, and on October 18, 2016, Baxalta received approval from the European Commission to market ONIVYDE in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin for the treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in adult patients who have progressed following gemcitabine-based therapy. ONIVYDE is our first and only product candidate to receive regulatory approval. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on third-party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA and other regulatory agencies for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based on a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application or approval of other products for the same indication may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nIf we pursue development of a diagnostic to identify patients who are likely to benefit from a therapeutic product, failure to obtain approval for the diagnostic may prevent or delay approval of the therapeutic product.\nWe are attempting to develop diagnostics to identify patients who are likely to benefit from our therapeutic product candidates. We currently rely on and expect to continue to rely on third parties for much of the development, testing and manufacturing of our diagnostics. We will likely rely on such third parties to also obtain any required regulatory approval for and then commercially supply such diagnostics. All of our diagnostic candidates are in preclinical or clinical development. We have very limited experience in the development of diagnostics and, even with the help of third parties with greater experience, may fail to obtain the required diagnostic product marketing approval, which could prevent or delay approval of the therapeutic product.\nIn July 2014, the FDA issued final guidance that stated that if safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic unless the FDA approves or clears this \u201cin vitro companion diagnostic device\u201d at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic. The approval or clearance of the in vitro diagnostic most likely will occur through the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health. Even with the issuance of the final guidance, the FDA\u2019s expectations for in vitro companion diagnostics remain unclear in some respects. The FDA\u2019s developing expectations will affect our in vitro diagnostics. In particular, the FDA may limit our ability to use retrospective data, otherwise disagree with our approaches to trial design, biomarker qualification, clinical and analytical validity and clinical utility, or make us repeat aspects of the trial or initiate new trials.\nBecause our diagnostic candidates are at an early stage of development, we cannot yet know what the FDA will require for any of these tests. For several of our clinical stage product candidates, namely MM-121 and MM-141, we are attempting to develop an in vitro diagnostic that will help identify patients likely to benefit from the therapy. Whether the FDA will consider these in vitro diagnostics to be \u201cin vitro companion diagnostic devices\u201d that require simultaneous approval or clearance with the therapeutics will depend on whether the FDA views the diagnostics to be essential to the safety and efficacy of these therapeutics.\nBased on the FDA\u2019s past practice with companion diagnostics, if we are successful in developing a diagnostic for any of our clinical stage product candidates, we would expect that FDA approval of an in vitro companion diagnostic, or possibly an in vivo companion diagnostic, would be required for approval and subsequent commercialization of each such therapeutic product candidate. We are not aware of any currently available diagnostics that, if necessary, would otherwise allow us to proceed with the approval and subsequent commercialization of our product candidates despite a delay in or failure of our attempts to develop diagnostics.\nFor ONIVYDE, although we are also investigating possible in vitro diagnostics, we are currently investigating in vivo diagnostics in the form of imaging agents that may help identify patients more likely to benefit from the therapy. Imaging agents for diagnostic use would most likely be regulated as drugs by the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and, as such, would be generally subject to the regulatory requirements applicable to other new drug candidates. Alternatively, several in vivo imaging agents have been regulated as medical devices by FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Although the FDA has not issued guidance with respect to the simultaneous approval of in vivo diagnostics and therapeutics, it is possible that the FDA will apply a standard similar to that for in vitro diagnostics.\nBecause we expect to rely on third parties for various aspects of the development, testing and manufacture, as well as for regulatory approval for and commercial supply, of our diagnostics, the commercial success of any of our product candidates that require a diagnostic will be tied to and dependent on the continued ability of such third parties to make the diagnostic commercially available on reasonable terms in the relevant geographies.\nIf we fail to maintain orphan drug exclusivity or designation for ONIVYDE or MM-141, we will have to rely on other rights and protections for these product candidates.\nWe have obtained orphan drug exclusivity in the United States for ONIVYDE for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and orphan medicinal product designation in the European Union for ONIVYDE for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In addition, we have obtained orphan drug designation in the United States for MM-141 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.\nIn the United States, the company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for that indication for a period of seven years. This orphan drug exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines the term \u201csame drug\u201d to mean a drug that contains the same active molecule and that is intended for the same use as the approved orphan drug. Orphan drug\nexclusivity may be lost if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nThe EMA grants orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that may offer therapeutic benefits for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. Orphan medicinal product designation from the EMA provides ten years of marketing exclusivity following drug approval, subject to reduction to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met.\nOur therapeutic product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biological or drug products may face competition sooner than expected.\nWith the enactment of the BPCIA as part of the Health Care Reform Laws, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on their similarity to existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. The BPCIA is complex and has yet to be fully interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning is subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that any of our products approved as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for the twelve year period of exclusivity. However:\n\u2022\na potential competitor could seek and obtain approval of its own BLA during our exclusivity period instead of seeking approval of a biosimilar version; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA could consider a particular product candidate which contains both drug and biological product components to be a drug subject to review pursuant to an NDA, and therefore eligible for a significantly shorter marketing exclusivity period as provided under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984.\nMoreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nIn addition, a drug product approved under an NDA, such as ONIVYDE, could face generic competition earlier than expected. The enactment of the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 as part of the FDASIA established a user fee program that will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for the FDA\u2019s generic drug review program. Funding from the user fee program, along with performance goals that the FDA negotiated with the generic drug industry, could significantly decrease the timeframe for FDA review and approval of generic drug applications.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products abroad.\nWe intend to market our products, including ONIVYDE, either ourselves or with commercialization partners, both within and outside the United States. This may increase the risks described below with respect to our compliance with foreign regulations.\nIn order to market and sell ONIVYDE and our other products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we or our commercialization partners must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing, including sometimes additional testing in children. The time required to obtain approval in foreign countries may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be sold in that country. We or our commercialization partners may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory\nauthorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We or our commercialization partners may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nONIVYDE and any other product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP or QSR requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nrecall of products;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDASIA provides the FDA with new inspection authorities. A drug or biologic will be considered adulterated, with possible resulting civil and criminal penalties, if the owner or operator of the establishment where it is made, processed, packed or held delays, denies, limits or refuses inspection. The FDASIA also replaces the biennial inspection schedule for drugs and biologics with a risk-based inspection schedule. The law grants the FDA authority to require a drug or biologics manufacturer to provide, in advance or instead of an inspection, and at the manufacturer\u2019s expense, any records or other information that the agency may otherwise inspect at the facility. The FDASIA also permits the FDA to share inspection information with foreign governments under certain circumstances. The FDASIA is complex and has yet to be fully interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty.\nThe FDASIA also provides the FDA with additional authority to exercise against manufacturers of drugs or biologics that are not adhering to pediatric study requirements, which apply even if the manufacturer is not seeking to market the drug or biologic to pediatric patients. As of April 2013, the FDA must issue non-compliance letters to companies who do not meet the pediatric study requirements. Any company receiving a non-compliance letter would have an opportunity to respond, and the non-compliance letter and company response would become publicly available.\nFuture legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any products for which we obtain marketing approval.\nFor example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Health Care Reform Laws, which were intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, provide benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, implement rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges and changes to the Medicare Drug Rebate program, expand the PHS\u2019 340B drug pricing program, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. These changes impact existing government healthcare programs and are resulting in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. Further, the Health Care Reform Laws impose a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners.\nSome states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the Health Care Reform Laws. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales, business and financial condition. Where Medicaid patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new options made available through the Health Care Reform Laws, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues. In addition, the federal government has also announced delays in the implementation of key provisions of the Health Care Reform Laws, including the employer mandate. The implications of these delays for our sales, business and financial condition, if any, are not yet clear.\nThe Health Care Reform Laws appear likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nWith the new U.S. presidential administration and Congress, there will likely be additional legislative changes, including the repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Laws. To that end, on January 20, 2017, the President issued an Executive Order Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal. The Executive Order declares that, pending repeal of the Health Care Reform Laws, it is imperative for the executive branch to ensure that the law is being efficiently implemented, take all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the Health Care Reform Laws, and prepare to afford the states more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare market. The Executive Order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Health Care Reform Laws to exercise their authority and discretion to waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Health Care Reform Laws that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance or makers of medical devices, products or medications.\nWith respect to repeal of the Health Care Reform Laws and their replacement with new legislation, it is unclear when such legislation will be enacted, what it will provide and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the costs of healthcare.\nWe expect that the Health Care Reform Laws, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under U.S. governmental pricing programs, we could be required to reimburse government programs for underpayments and could pay penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a condition of reimbursement for ONIVYDE and any other product approved by the FDA, various U.S. federal and state healthcare programs require that we calculate and report certain pricing information to U.S. federal and state healthcare agencies. For example, we are required to provide average selling price information to CMS on a quarterly basis in order to compute Medicare Part B payment rates. Price reporting and payment obligations are highly complex and vary among products and programs. The calculation of average selling price includes a number of inputs from contracts with wholesalers, specialty distributors, group purchasing organizations and other customers. We are also required to make an assessment of whether these agreements are deemed to be for bona fide services and that the services are deemed to be at fair market value in our industry and for our products. Our processes for estimating amounts due under these governmental pricing programs involve subjective decisions. As a result, our price reporting calculations are subject to the risk of errors and our methodologies for calculating these prices could be challenged under the federal False Claims Act or other laws. In addition, the Health Care Reform Laws modified the rules related to certain price reports and expanded the scope of pharmaceutical product sales to which Medicaid rebates apply, among other things. Uncertainty exists\ncurrently, as many of the specific determinations necessary to implement this new legislation have yet to be decided and communicated to industry participants. This uncertainty in the interpretation of the legislation increases the chances of an error in price reporting, which could in turn lead to a legal challenge, restatement or investigation. If we become subject to investigations, restatements or other inquiries concerning our compliance with price reporting laws and regulations, we could be required to pay or be subject to additional reimbursements, penalties, sanctions or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and other governmental pricing programs, and we have obligations to report average sales price under the Medicare program. Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. For example, the Medicaid rebate amount is computed each quarter based on our submission to the CMS of our AMP and best price for the quarter. If we become aware that our reporting for prior quarters was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we will be obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would serve to increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid rebate program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the price that we will be required to charge certain safety net providers under the PHS\u2019 340B drug pricing program.\nWe are liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data and for overcharging government payers. For example, in addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false AMP or best price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $100,000 per item of false information. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of $10,000 per day for each day the submission is late beyond the due date. In the event that CMS were to terminate our rebate agreement, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our products. In addition, if we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or under any other government program, we will be required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges could result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations.\nCMS and the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have pursued manufacturers that were alleged to have failed to report these data to the government in a timely manner. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect.\nIf we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or the Tricare retail pharmacy program, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we would be required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations.\nUnexpected refunds to the federal government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. If we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, we may become subject to significant fines and other liability.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we are found to have promoted for off-label uses, we may become subject to significant government fines and other related liability. For example, the U.S. government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The government has also required companies to enter into complex multi-year corporate integrity agreements and/or non-prosecution agreements that can impose significant restrictions and other burdens on the affected companies.\nIn addition, incentives under applicable U.S. laws encourage employees and physicians to report violations of rules governing promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. These incentives could lead to so called whistleblower lawsuits as part of which such persons seek to collect a portion of moneys allegedly overbilled to government agencies due to, for example, promotion of pharmaceutical products beyond labeled claims. Such lawsuits, whether with or without merit, are typically time consuming and costly to defend. Such suits may also result in related stockholder lawsuits, which are also costly to defend.\nOur relationships with customers and payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and others play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of ONIVYDE and any other products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute ONIVYDE and any other products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u2022\nthe federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, order or recommendation of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other, and violations are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor;\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have initiated investigations or brought private lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies for a variety of allegedly improper promotional or marketing activities, such as allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates; allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; or engaging in promotion for \u201coff-label\u201d uses. Additionally, the Health Care Reform Laws amended the federal False Claims Act such that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute can serve as a basis for liability under the False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nHIPAA makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully execute or attempt to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal false statements statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022\nthe federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Laws requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests, and provides for public reporting of the data reported by manufacturers;\n\u2022\nthe FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity, and encompasses many healthcare professionals in many countries under the definition of a foreign government official;\n\u2022\nthe Bribery Act, which applies to U.S. companies such as ourselves that conduct business in the United Kingdom, proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. In addition, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Other states require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, or prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain healthcare providers.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also harm our financial condition. Responding to government investigations or whistleblower lawsuits, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, damages, penalties, settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.\nOur corporate compliance efforts cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations.\nThe development, manufacturing, pricing, sales, coverage and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are and will be subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and other authorities within the United States and numerous entities outside of the United States. While we have implemented a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices, we cannot provide any assurance that governmental authorities will find that our business practices comply with current or future administrative or judicial interpretations of potentially applicable laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these laws and regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, including suspension or termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of ONIVYDE or other products from the market, significant fines, disqualification or debarment from participation in federally-funded healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation, any of which events may have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Data Protection and Cybersecurity\nOur failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe are subject to data protection laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties, private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. We could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information in a manner that is not authorized or permitted.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or security breaches could adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, among other things, trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information). It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and as a result we manage a number of third-party vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, and the large amounts of confidential information stored on those systems, make such systems vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors, and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems, or those of our third-party vendors, or security breaches could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or\nthe prevention of access to, confidential information, including, among other things, trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation, require us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Security breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our executive and scientific teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nOur corporate restructuring and the associated headcount reductions announced in October 2016 and January 2017 may not result in anticipated savings, could result in total costs and expenses and attrition that are greater than expected and could disrupt our business.\nOn October 3, 2016, we announced a 22% reduction in headcount as part of a major corporate restructuring with the objective of prioritizing our research and development on a focused set of systems biology-derived oncology products and strengthening our financial runway. Additionally, on January 9, 2017, we announced that we will further reduce headcount in connection with the asset sale to Ipsen and the completion of our strategic pipeline review. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our cost structure from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from the restructuring, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We also cannot guarantee that we will not have to undertake additional headcount reductions or restructuring activities in the future. Furthermore, our restructuring plan may be disruptive to our operations. For example, our headcount reductions could yield unanticipated consequences, such as attrition beyond planned staff reductions, or increase difficulties in our day-to-day operations. Our headcount reductions could also harm our ability to attract and retain qualified management, scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel who are critical to our business. Any failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could prevent us from successfully developing and commercializing our product candidates in the future.\nWe have entered into and may continue to enter into or seek to enter into business combinations, acquisitions or divestitures which may be difficult to consummate, disrupt our business, divert management attention or dilute stockholder value.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may enter into business combinations, acquisitions or divestitures. Although we acquired Hermes in October 2009 and are in the process of consummating the asset sale to Ipsen, we have limited experience in making acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, acquisitions and divestitures are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating or separating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies or divested product;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and expenses;\n\u2022\nthe failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination, acquisition or divestiture;\n\u2022\nthe maintenance of acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022\nthe impairment of relationships with employees as a result of any integration or separation of management and other personnel.\nIf we are not successful in completing acquisitions or divestitures that we may pursue in the future, we would be required to reevaluate our business strategy and we may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete the acquisitions or divestitures. In addition, with future acquisitions, we could use substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price. As we did for the acquisition of Hermes, we could also issue additional securities as consideration for these acquisitions, which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders maintain the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, in the aggregate, beneficially own a large portion of our capital stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, would significantly influence the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could allow, delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions:\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nFurther, the repurchase right under the convertible notes in connection with a fundamental change (as defined therein) and any increase in the conversion rate in connection with a make-whole fundamental change could also discourage a potential acquirer.\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be volatile, which could cause holders of our common stock to incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been and in the future may be subject to substantial price volatility. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders could incur substantial losses. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize ONIVYDE in combination with 5-FU and leucovorin for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy through the time at which the asset sale to Ipsen is consummated or in the event the asset sale is not consummated;\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nactivism by any single large stockholder or combination of stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe indenture governing our 11.50% senior secured notes due 2022 imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.\nOn December 22, 2015, we issued $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.50% senior secured notes due 2022. The indenture governing the 2022 notes contains covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take various actions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of debt;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of our preferred stock;\n\u2022\nthe payment of dividends, the repurchase of shares and making certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nthe prepayment, redemption or repurchase of subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nthe sale, lease or transfer of property and assets;\n\u2022\nengaging in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nthe making of investments other than those permitted by the indenture.\nThe indenture specifies a number of events of default, some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods, including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, and non-payment of material judgments.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by many factors, including events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy those requirements. Our failure to comply with our obligations could result in an event of default under our other indebtedness and the acceleration of our other indebtedness, in whole or in part, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the 2022 notes.\nThe restrictions contained in the indenture governing the 2022 notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nIn connection with the closing of the asset sale to Ipsen, we intend to redeem all $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2022 notes at the then-applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying regular cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of gain for holders of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. Although we plan to pay the special cash dividend following the asset sale to Ipsen, subject to approval by our board of directors, we do not currently intend to pay any regular cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our existing debt agreements limit our ability to pay dividends, and the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, with the exception of the anticipated special cash dividend, capital appreciation of our common stock, if any, will be the sole source of gain for holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock, including by us or our directors and executive officers or shares issued upon the exercise of currently outstanding options, or upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes, could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nA substantial portion of our outstanding common stock can be traded without restriction at any time. In addition, a portion of our outstanding common stock is currently restricted as a result of federal securities laws, but can be sold at any time subject to applicable volume limitations. As such, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, by us or others, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, we have a significant number of shares that are subject to outstanding options, and we may issue shares of our common stock upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes. The exercise of these options or the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock could cause a further decline in our stock price. For instance, in April 2016, we issued an aggregate of 12,367,663 shares of our common stock to certain holders of our convertible notes who had agreed to convert an aggregate of $64.2 million of convertible notes. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that any future issuances may have on the market price for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13325, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MACK"}
