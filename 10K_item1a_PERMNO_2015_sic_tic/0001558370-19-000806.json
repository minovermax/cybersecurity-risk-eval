RISK FACTORS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nOur business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA substantial or extended decline in gold or copper prices would have a material adverse effect on Newmont.\nOur business is dependent on the prices of gold and copper, which fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence prices include:\n\u00b7\nGold sales, purchases or leasing by governments and central banks;\n\u00b7\nSpeculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold or copper;\n\u00b7\nThe relative strength of the U.S. dollar;\n\u00b7\nThe monetary policies employed by the world\u2019s major Central Banks;\n\u00b7\nThe fiscal policies employed by the world\u2019s major industrialized economies;\n\u00b7\nExpectations of the future rate of inflation;\n\u00b7\nInterest rates;\n\u00b7\nRecession or reduced economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries;\n\u00b7\nDecreased industrial, jewelry or investment demand;\n\u00b7\nIncreased import and export taxes;\n\u00b7\nIncreased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;\n\u00b7\nForward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions; and\n\u00b7\nAvailability of cheaper substitute materials.\nAverage gold prices for 2018 were $1,268 per ounce (2017: $1,257; 2016: $1,251) and average copper prices for 2018 were $2.96 per pound (2017: $2.80; 2016: $2.21). Any decline in our realized gold or copper price adversely impacts our revenues, net income and operating cash flows, particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to gold or\ncopper sales. We have recorded asset impairments in the past and may experience additional impairments as a result of lower gold or copper prices in the future.\nIn addition, sustained lower gold or copper prices can:\n\u00b7\nReduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that have become uneconomic at sustained lower gold or copper prices;\n\u00b7\nReduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads and increase the likelihood and amount that the Company might be required to record as an impairment charge related to the carrying value of its stockpiles;\n\u00b7\nHalt or delay the development of new projects;\n\u00b7\nReduce funds available for exploration and advanced projects with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced; and\n\u00b7\nReduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices.\nWe may be unable to replace gold and copper reserves as they become depleted.\nGold and copper producers must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineral producing operations. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.\nWe may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore reserves from others related to development properties and operating mines. Such acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical operating results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. Other factors that affect our decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our assumptions for future gold or copper prices or other mineral prices and the projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or potential liabilities associated with the property and its operations and projections of how these may change in the future. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties (including ability to permit and compliance with existing regulations) and which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. Other than historical operating results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our revenue, our cash flow and other operating issues, as well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process used to estimate ore reserves. In addition, there may be intense competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.\nEstimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.\nThe reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold and copper that we estimated, at December 31, 2018, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold and copper and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results. Producers use feasibility studies for undeveloped orebodies to derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. Actual\noperating and capital cost and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time, the economic feasibility of production may change.\nAdditionally, the term \u201cmineralized material\u201d does not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the SEC or the Company\u2019s standards. Estimates of mineralized material are subject to further exploration and development, and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Despite the Company\u2019s history of converting a substantial portion of mineralized material to reserves through additional drilling and study work, the Company cannot be certain that any part or parts of the mineralized material deposit will ever be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.\nIn addition, if the price of gold or copper declines from recent levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, we can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves or mineralized material can be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our ore reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves and mineralized material. Consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and mineralized material are less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position may be materially impaired.\nIncreased operating and capital costs could affect our profitability.\nCosts at any particular mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel, concrete and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow.\nWe could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with the development of new projects in challenging jurisdictions and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond our control. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the profitability of and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects.\nEstimates relating to new development projects and mine plans of existing operations are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than estimated.\nMine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. Such projects could experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up.\nOur decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of feasibility studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors, among others:\n\u00b7\nChanges in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore to be mined and processed;\n\u00b7\nChanges in input commodity and labor costs;\n\u00b7\nThe quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made;\n\u00b7\nAdverse geotechnical conditions;\n\u00b7\nAvailability of adequate and skilled labor force;\n\u00b7\nAvailability, supply and cost of water and power;\n\u00b7\nFluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nAvailability and terms of financing;\n\u00b7\nDelays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development;\n\u00b7\nChanges in tax laws, the laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes due to the regional and national governments and royalty agreements;\n\u00b7\nWeather or severe climate impacts, including, without limitation, prolonged or unexpected precipitation, drought and/or sub-zero temperatures;\n\u00b7\nPotential delays relating to social and community issues, including, without limitation, issues resulting in protests, road blockages or work stoppages; and\n\u00b7\nPotential challenges to permits or other approvals or delays in development and construction of projects based on claims of disturbance of cultural resources.\nNew projects require, among other things, the successful completion of feasibility studies, attention to various fiscal, tax and royalty matters, obtainment of, and compliance with, required governmental permits and arrangements for necessary surface and other land rights. We may also have to identify adequate sources of water and power for new projects, ensure that appropriate community infrastructure (for example, reliable rail, ports, roads, and bridges) is developed to support the project and secure appropriate financing to fund a new project. These infrastructures and services are often provided by third parties whose operational activities are outside of our control. Establishing infrastructure for our development projects requires significant resources, identification of adequate sources of raw materials and supplies, and the cooperation of national and regional governments, none of which can be assured. In addition, new projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future financial and operating performance, including future cash flow. Thus, it is possible that actual costs may increase significantly and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates. Consequently, our future development activities may not result in the expansion or replacement of current production with new production, or one or more of these new production sites or facilities may be less profitable than currently anticipated or may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nFor our existing operations, we base our mine plans on geological and metallurgical assumptions, financial projections and commodity price estimates. These estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations, including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material, revisions to environmental obligations, changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, and other significant events associated with mining operations. For example, in December 2018, we revised our historical estimates of proven and probable reserves at Carlin Open Pits in Nevada and at Phoenix in Nevada, a portion of which was reclassified to mineralized material. Further, future positive revisions, if any, remain subject to improvements in costs, recovery, gold price or a combination of these and other factors. Additionally, we review our operations for events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are determined to exist at our mine operations, we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Management makes multiple assumptions in estimating future undiscounted cash flows, which include productions levels based on life of mine plans, future costs of production, estimates of future production levels based on value beyond proven and probable reserves at the operations, prices of metals, the historical experience of the operations and other factors. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating production levels of gold and copper and the costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges. We may be required to recognize impairments of long-lived assets in the future if actual results differ materially from management\u2019s estimates, which include metal prices, our ability to reduce or control production or capital costs through strategic mine optimization initiatives, increased costs or decreased production due to regulatory issues or if we do not realize the mineable ore reserves or exploration potential at our mining properties. If an impairment charge is incurred, such charges are not reversible at a later date even when favorable modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material, favorable revisions to environmental obligations, favorable changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, and other favorable events occur.\nOur business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other extraterritorial and domestic anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and other collateral consequences and reputational harm.\nWe operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws and heightened expectations of enforcement authorities may be in tension with certain local customs and practices. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws with extraterritorial reach, including the U.K. Bribery Act, and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. We have an ethics and compliance program which includes our Code of Conduct, Business Integrity Policy and other policies and standards, all of which mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws by the Company and its subsidiaries and their personnel, and also by third parties when they are engaged on our behalf. Our program also includes a well-publicized hot line for raising issues and processes for investigating such issues and assurances of non-retaliation for persons who in good faith raise concerns. We report regularly to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on such programs. There can be no assurance that Newmont\u2019s internal control policies and procedures will always protect it from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable laws and internal policies, recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company\u2019s affiliates, employees, agents or associated persons for which we might be claimed to be responsible. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. We occasionally identify or are apprised of information or allegations that certain employees, affiliates, agents or associated persons may have engaged in unlawful conduct for which we might be held responsible. Our policy when receiving credible information or allegations is to conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews to evaluate that information, determine compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations and company policies and take such remedial steps as may be warranted. In appropriate circumstances, we communicate with authorities in the United States and elsewhere about those investigations and reviews. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, loss of operating licenses or permits and other collateral consequences, and may damage the Company\u2019s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nMine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.\nNatural resource extractive companies are required to close their operations and rehabilitate the lands that they mine in accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Estimates of the total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs for gold and copper mining operations are significant and based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and mine closure plans that may change materially. For example, we have conducted extensive remediation work at two inactive sites in the United States. We are conducting remediation activities at a third site in the United States, an inactive uranium mine and mill site formerly operated by a subsidiary of Newmont. In addition, we may be held responsible for the costs of addressing contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third party sites or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances.\nThe laws and regulations governing mine closure and remediation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. For a more detailed description of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, regulators are increasingly requesting security in the form of cash collateral, credit, trust arrangements or guarantees to secure the performance of environmental obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position.\nUnder the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (\u201cCERCLA\u201d) and its state law equivalents, current or former owners of properties may be held jointly and severally liable for the costs of site cleanup or required to undertake remedial actions in response to unpermitted releases of hazardous substances at such property, in addition to, among other potential consequences, liability to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be significant. These subject properties are referred to as \u201csuperfund\u201d sites. For example, the inactive uranium mine and mill at Midnite Mine is a superfund site subject to CERCLA. It is possible that certain of our other current or former operations in the U.S. could be designated as a superfund site in the future, exposing us to potential liability under CERCLA.\nAny underestimated or unanticipated retirement and rehabilitation costs could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is\nincreased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income attributable to Newmont stockholders and potentially result in impairments.\nFor example, the Company completed a comprehensive study of the Yanacocha long-term mining and closure plans in 2016 as part of the requirement to submit an updated closure plan to Peruvian regulators every five years. As a result, the Company recorded an increase to the reclamation obligation at Yanacocha for the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with an update to the Yanacocha closure plan, resulting in an increase to the recorded asset retirement cost related to the producing areas of the mine and a non-cash charge to reclamation expense related to the areas of the mine no longer in production. The increase to the reclamation obligation was primarily due to higher estimated long-term water management costs, heap leach earthworks and related support activities. For additional information regarding our review of the Yanacocha closure plan, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur business depends on good relations with our employees.\nProduction at our mines is dependent upon the efforts of our employees and, consequently, our maintenance of good relationships with our employees. Due to union activities or other employee actions, we could experience labor disputes, work stops or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us. At December 31, 2018, various unions represented approximately 34% of our employee workforce worldwide. Labor rates in Ghana are agreed through 2018, but negotiations relating to other terms and conditions remain ongoing. One of our labor agreements in Peru expires February 2019 and will be the subject of contract negotiations in 2019. The Company entered into a collective labor agreement in Nevada that will expire in January 2022. A failure to successfully enter into new contracts could result in future labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. We are just beginning preliminary discussions with a new union formed in March 2018 at Merian in Suriname. A failure to successfully enter into an initial contract could result in similar risks as described above. There can be no assurance that any future disputes at the Company\u2019s operations or projects will be resolved without disruptions.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees, our business and future operations may be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon the services of a number of key executives and management personnel. Our success is also dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce. There continues to be competition over highly skilled personnel in our industry. The loss of members of our highly-skilled and experienced management and workforce or our inability to attract and retain additional experienced management and skilled workers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nDamage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nDamage to our reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of a variety of events and circumstances, and could result in negative publicity (for example, with respect to our handling of environmental matters or our dealings with local community organizations). The growing use of social media to generate, publish and discuss community news and issues and to connect with others has made it significantly easier, among other things, for individuals and groups to share their opinions of us and our activities, whether true or not. We do not have direct control over how we are perceived by others and loss of reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nCurrency fluctuations may affect our costs.\nCurrency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur at our operations. Gold and copper are sold throughout the world based principally on the U.S. dollar price, but a portion of our operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The appreciation of those local currencies against the U.S. dollar increases our costs of production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the United States.\nThe foreign currency that primarily impacts our results of operations is the Australian dollar. We estimate that every $0.10 increase in the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate increases annually the U.S. dollar Costs applicable to sales by approximately $84 for each ounce of gold sold from operations in Australia before taking into account the impact of currency hedging. The annual average Australian dollar exchange rate depreciated by approximately 2% from December 31, 2017 to\nDecember 31, 2018. The annual average Australian dollar exchange rate appreciated by approximately 3% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nInflation may have a material adverse effect on results of operations.\nCertain of our operations are located in countries that have in the past experienced high rates of inflation. It is possible that in the future, high inflation in the countries in which we operate may result in an increase in operational costs in local currencies (without a concurrent devaluation of the local currency of operations against the dollar or an increase in the dollar price of gold and copper). This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Significantly higher and sustained rates of inflation, with subsequent increases in operational costs, could result in the deferral or closure of projects and mines in the event that operating costs become prohibitive.\nOur business requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to raise additional funding on favorable terms.\nThe construction and operation of potential future projects and various exploration projects will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow and other sources of funding may become insufficient to meet all of these requirements, depending on the timing and costs of development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices, our operational performance and our current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or a further dislocation in the financial markets as experienced in recent years, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing operations, retire or service all of our outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained.\nTo the extent that we seek to expand our operations and increase our reserves through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.\nFrom time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to provide increased returns to our shareholders and to expand our operations and reported reserves and, potentially, generate synergies. The success of any acquisition would depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nIdentifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms;\n\u00b7\nObtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially Newmont\u2019s shareholders;\n\u00b7\nMaintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nImplementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and\n\u00b7\nTo the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by rising energy prices or energy shortages.\nOur mining operations and development projects require significant amounts of energy. Increasing global demand for energy, concerns about nuclear power and the limited growth of new energy sources are affecting the price and supply of energy. A variety of factors, including higher energy usage in emerging market economies, actual and proposed taxation of carbon emissions as well as concerns surrounding unrest and potential conflict in the Middle East, could result in increased demand or limited supply of energy and/or sharply escalating diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and other energy prices. Increased energy prices could negatively impact our operating costs and cash flow.\nOur principal energy sources are electricity, purchased petroleum products, natural gas and coal. Some of our operations are in remote locations requiring long distance transmission of power, and in some locations we compete with other companies for access to third party power generators or electrical supply networks. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations.\nContinuation of our mining production is dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies to support our mining operations.\nOur mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Our operations in North and South America and Australia are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights, claims and contracts and to defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights, claims and contracts to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to our water rights, claims, contracts and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company\u2019s control. For example, the continuation of the below average rainfall or the occurrence of drought in southwest Australia could impact our raw water supply at Boddington. While we incorporated systems to address the impact of the dry season as part of our operating plans, we can make no assurances that those systems will be sufficient to address all shortages in water supply, which could result in production and processing interruptions. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in our operations, thus adversely affecting our operations.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation, upgrade and integration.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. We have experienced attempts by external parties to penetrate our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for preparing and protecting against such attempts and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions. In addition, as technologies evolve and these cybersecurity attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. For instance, we engage an independent third party to conduct penetration and vulnerability testing on an annual basis and review findings and recommendations from these tests, we then seek to address any remediation actions through our ongoing cyber security program. Such efforts may incur significant costs and yet prove insufficient to deter future cybersecurity attacks or prevent all security breaches.\nWe could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow and overall profitability.\nWe maintain insurance policies that mitigate against certain risks related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable depending upon the circumstances surrounding each identified risk. However, we may elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for various other reasons; in other cases, insurance may not be available for certain risks. Some concern always exists with respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest, war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic crises are possible. These countries may also pose heightened risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption, increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and contracts. We do not maintain insurance policies against political risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects.\nA significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u00b7\nNegotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;\n\u00b7\nThe inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n\u00b7\nReduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;\n\u00b7\nFailure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;\n\u00b7\nInterruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n\u00b7\nFailure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and\n\u00b7\nProblems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues.\nIn addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nTo the extent we hold or acquire interests in any joint ventures or joint operations or enter into any joint ventures or joint operations in the future, our interest in these properties is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of joint ventures or joint operations.\nTo the extent we hold or acquire interests in any joint ventures or joint operations or enter into any joint ventures or joint operations in the future, the existence or occurrence of one or more of the following circumstances and events could have a material adverse impact on our profitability or the viability of our interests held through joint ventures, which could have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition:\n\u00b7\ndisagreements with partners on strategy for the most efficient development or operation of mines;\n\u00b7\ninability to control certain strategic decisions made in respect of properties;\n\u00b7\ninability of partners to meet their financial and other obligations to the joint venture, joint operation or third parties; and\n\u00b7\nlitigation between partners regarding management, funding or other decisions related to the joint venture or joint operation.\nTo the extent that we are not the operator of a joint venture or joint operation properties, we will be unable to control the activities of the operator and as a result the success of such operations will be beyond our control. In many cases we will be bound by\nthe decisions made by the operator in the operation of such property, and will rely on the operator to manage the property and to provide accurate information related to such property. We can provide no assurance that all decisions of operators of properties we do not control will achieve the expected results.\nWe are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to Newmont, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. Furthermore, to the extent we sell or reduce our interest in certain assets, we may give representations and warranties and indemnities customary for such transactions and we may agree to retain responsibility for certain liabilities related to the period prior to the sale. As a result, we may incur liabilities in the future associated with assets we no longer own or in which we have a reduced interest. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 29 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nTitle to some of our properties may be defective or challenged.\nAlthough we have conducted title reviews of our properties, title review does not preclude third parties from challenging our title or related property rights. While we believe that we have satisfactory title to our properties, some titles may be defective or subject to challenge by governments, indigenous or communal peoples, or private parties. For example, at our Conga project in Peru, we continue to seek resolution to a land dispute with local residents. In addition, certain of our Australian properties could be subject to native title or traditional landowner claims, and our ability to use these properties is dependent on agreements with traditional owners of the properties. A determination of defective title or risks in connection with a challenge to title rights could impact existing operations as well as exploration and development projects, and future acquisitions which could have an adverse effect on operations, our ability to develop new projects, and our financial position. For more information regarding native title or traditional landowner claims, see the discussion under the Australia Section of Item 2, Properties, in this report.\nCivil disturbances, criminal activities, including illegal mining, and artisanal mining, occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties, which can disrupt business and expose the Company to liability.\nCivil disturbances and criminal activities such as trespass, illegal mining, sabotage, theft and vandalism may cause disruptions and could result in the suspension of operations and development at certain sites. Incidents of such activities have occasionally led to conflict with security personnel and/or police, which in some cases resulted in injuries including in Peru and Suriname. Although security measures have been implemented by the Company to protect employees, property and assets, such measures will not guarantee that such incidents will not continue to occur in the future, or result in harm to employees or trespassers, decrease operational efficiency or construction delays, increase community tensions or result in liabilities. The manner in which the Company\u2019s personnel, national police or other security forces respond to civil disturbances and criminal activities can give rise to additional risks where those responses are not conducted in a manner consistent with international and Newmont standards relating to the use of force and respect for human rights.\nNewmont takes seriously our obligation to respect and promote human rights, is a signatory to and active participant in the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, and has adopted a Sustainability and Stakeholder Engagement Policy and Human Rights Standard in-line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights due diligence processes. Nonetheless, although the Company has implemented a number of significant measures and safeguards which are intended to ensure that personnel understand and uphold these standards, the implementation of these measures will not guarantee that personnel, national police or other security forces will uphold these standards in every instance. The evolving expectations related to human rights, indigenous rights, and environmental protections may result in opposition to our current and future operations or the development of new projects and mines. Such opposition may take the form of legal or administrative proceedings or manifestations such as protests, roadblocks or other forms of public expression against our activities, and may have a negative impact on our reputation and operations. Opposition by community and activist groups to our operations may require modification of, or preclude the operation or development of, our projects and mines or may require us to enter into agreements with such groups or local governments with respect to our projects and mines, in some cases, causing increased costs and significant delays to the advancement of our projects. The failure to conduct\noperations in accordance with Company standards can result in harm to employees, community members or trespassers, increase community tensions, reputational harm to Newmont or result in criminal and/or civil liability and/or financial damages or penalties.\nArtisanal and illegal miners have been active on, or adjacent to, some of Newmont\u2019s African and South American properties, including recently at Suriname. Illegal mining, which involves trespass into the development or operating area of the mine, is both a security and safety issue, which may present a security threat to property and human life. The illegal miners from time to time have clashed with security staff and law enforcement personnel who have attempted to move them away from the facilities. Although, under certain circumstances, artisanal mining may be a legally sanctioned activity, artisanal mining is also associated with a number of negative impacts, including environmental degradation, poor working practices, erosion of civil society, human rights abuse and funding of conflict. The environmental, social, safety and health impacts of artisanal and illegal mining are frequently attributed to formal mining activity, and it is often assumed that artisanally-mined gold is channeled through large-scale mining operators, even though artisanal and large-scale miners may have separate supply chains. These misconceptions impact negatively on the reputation of the industry. The activities of the illegal miners could cause damage to Newmont\u2019s properties for which Newmont could potentially be held responsible. The presence of illegal miners could lead to exploration and project delays and disputes regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits. Illegal mining and theft could also result in lost gold production and reserves, mine and development stoppages, and have a material adverse effect on financial condition or results of operations or project development.\nCompetition from other natural resource companies may harm our business.\nWe compete with other natural resource companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We also compete with other natural resource companies for specialized equipment, components and supplies, such as drill rigs, necessary for exploration and development, as well as for rights to mine properties containing gold, copper and other minerals. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.\nWe recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. In the future, our estimates could change requiring a valuation allowance or impairment of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements under the heading \u201cIncome and Mining Taxes - Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\u201d and Note 2 under the heading \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies - Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\u201d for additional information and factors that could impact the Company\u2019s ability to realize the deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s non-current deferred tax assets were $401.\nReturns for investments in pension plans are uncertain.\nWe maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide for specified payments after retirement. The ability of the pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions. A sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. If future plan investment returns are not sufficient, we may be required to increase the amount of future cash contributions.\nAny downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could increase our future borrowing costs and adversely affect the availability of new financing.\nThere can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services or Moody\u2019s Investors Service to Newmont will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. The Company\u2019s credit ratings have been subject to change over the years. We\ncurrently maintain a Standard & Poor\u2019s rating of \u201cBBB\u201d and a Moody\u2019s Investors Service rating of Baa2. We cannot make assurances regarding how long these ratings will remain unchanged or regarding the outcome of the rating agencies future reviews (including following any planned or future business combinations). A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase our borrowing costs, which in turn could impair our results of operations and financial position.\nFuture funding requirements may affect our business.\nPotential future investments, including projects in the Company\u2019s project pipeline, acquisitions and other investments, will require significant funds for capital expenditures. Depending on gold and copper prices, our operating cash flow may not be sufficient to meet all of these expenditures, depending on the timing of development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. We may determine that it may be necessary or preferable to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. Additional financing may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, any additional financing may involve substantial dilution to existing shareholders. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. In addition, our joint venture partners may not have sufficient funds or borrowing ability in order to make their capital commitments. In the case that our partners do not make their economic commitments, the Company may be prevented from pursuing certain development opportunities or may assume additional financial obligations, which may require new sources of capital.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining.\nThe exploration for natural resources and the development and production of mining operations are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nEnvironmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals;\n\u00b7\nIndustrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of mining equipment, milling equipment and/or conveyor systems and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of large-scale blasting operations, milling and processing;\n\u00b7\nAccidents in connection with transportation, including transportation of chemicals, explosions or other materials, transportation of large mining equipment and transportation of employees and business partners to and from sites;\n\u00b7\nSocial, community or labor force disputes or stoppages;\n\u00b7\nChanges to legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nSecurity incidents, including activities of illegal or artisanal miners, gold bullion or concentrate theft, and corruption and fraud;\n\u00b7\nShortages in materials or equipment and energy and electrical power supply interruptions or rationing;\n\u00b7\nFailure of unproven or evolving technologies or loss of information integrity or data;\n\u00b7\nSurface or underground fires or floods;\n\u00b7\nUnexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form);\n\u00b7\nMetallurgical conditions and gold recovery, including unexpected decline of ore grade;\n\u00b7\nUnanticipated changes in inventory levels at heap-leach operations;\n\u00b7\nGround and water conditions;\n\u00b7\nFall-of-ground accidents in underground operations;\n\u00b7\nFailure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls;\n\u00b7\nSeismic activity; and\n\u00b7\nOther natural phenomena, such as lightning, cyclonic or tropical storms, floods or other inclement weather conditions, including those impacting operations or the ability to access and supply sites. For example, in 2017 rainfall and flooding in Northern Australia and Peru, temporarily impacted our ability to import fuel and other key deliveries to our Tanami and Yanacocha sites, respectively.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development and production of mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.\nMining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate, and are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nAs a result of public concern about the real or perceived detrimental effects of economic globalization and global climate impacts, businesses generally and large multinational corporations in natural resources industries, such as Newmont, in particular, face increasing public scrutiny of their activities. These businesses are under pressure to demonstrate that, as they seek to generate satisfactory returns on investment to shareholders, other stakeholders, including employees, governments, communities surrounding operations and the countries in which they operate, benefit and will continue to benefit from their commercial activities. Such pressures tend to be particularly focused on companies whose activities are perceived to have a high impact on their social and physical environment. In Ghana, for instance, a number of community related demonstrations occurred during 2018 in response to the perceived impacts of our operations on the land and on fairness of compensation. Similarly, a number of community based groups continue pressuring the company for additional benefits related to jobs, training and benefit sharing. The company is seeking mechanisms for dialogue to understand concerns and address impacts and benefits in a transparent and participatory manner. The potential consequences of these pressures include reputational damage, legal suits, increasing social investment obligations to communities and pressure to increase taxes and royalties payable to governments.\nOur exploration, development, mining and processing operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and land use and the protection of the environment, which generally apply to air and water quality, protection of endangered, protected or other specified species, hazardous waste management and reclamation. For example, in recent years, plans to protect the greater sage grouse, a species whose natural habitat is found across much of the western United States, have been an area of significant focus. As a result, in 2016, Newmont, the State of Nevada and federal agencies agreed to a historic conservation agreement for 1.5 million acres of public and private lands managed by Newmont to protect and enhance the habitat of the greater sage grouse and other sagebrush ecosystem species. Following a programmatic review of federal greater sage grouse management plans, the US Department of Interior developed revised plans and analyzed their potential effects pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The public review of the proposed revised resource management plans is ongoing and implementation decisions are pending. The extent to which sage grouse conservation plans will be further revised and whether land withdrawals limiting development activities occurring on federal lands may occur remains unclear. No assurances can be made that possible land use restrictions will not have an adverse impact on our growth plans or not result in delays in project development, constraints on exploration and constraints on operations in impacted areas.\nSome of the countries in which we operate have implemented, and are developing, laws and regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. We have made, and expect to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such\nlaws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and burdens, and can cause delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, government permits and approvals which may adversely impact our closure processes and operations.\nFuture changes in applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, lead to the revocation of existing or future exploration or mining rights or otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. For instance, the operation of our mines in the United States is subject to regulation by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (\u201cMSHA\u201d) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the \u201cMine Act\u201d). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Over the past several years MSHA has significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations and increased the dollar penalties assessed for citations issued. If MSHA inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines, penalties or sanctions and our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures. MSHA issued fines, penalties or sanctions and mandated temporary or extended closures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. See Exhibit 95 to this report for additional information regarding certain MSHA orders and citations issued during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncreased global attention or regulation on consumption of water by industrial activities, as well as water quality discharge, and on restricting or prohibiting the use of cyanide and other hazardous substances in processing activities could similarly have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to increased compliance and input costs.\nWe have implemented a management system designed to promote continuous improvement in health and safety, environmental performance and community relations. However, we nevertheless in 2018 experienced seven fatalities, six at our operations in Ghana and one at our operations in Nevada, which involved subsequent investigations by Ghana\u2019s Mineral Commission and the MSHA, respectively. See Item 4 \u201cMine Safety Disclosures\u201d for additional information on these incidents. Our ability to operate (including the effect of any impact on our workforce) and thus, our results of operations and our financial position (including because of potential related fines and sanctions), could be adversely affected by accidents or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate.\nWe may be unable to obtain or retain necessary permits, which could adversely affect our operations.\nOur mining and processing operations and development and exploration activities are subject to extensive permitting requirements. The requirements to obtain and/or achieve or maintain full compliance with such permits can be costly and involve extended timelines. While we strive to obtain and comply with all permits required of us, there can be no assurance that we will obtain all such permits and/or achieve or maintain full compliance with such permits at all times. Previously obtained permits may be suspended or revoked for a number of reasons, including through government or court action. Failure to obtain and/or comply with required permits can have serious consequences, including damage to our reputation\u037e cessation of the development of a project; increased costs of development or production and litigation or regulatory action, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur ability to obtain the required permits and approvals to explore for, develop and operate mines and to successfully operate near communities in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends in part on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to operate near certain communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, health and safety of communities in which we operate. Key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be adjusted in a manner that adversely affects our operations, including our ability to explore or develop properties, commence production or continue operations.\nRegulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProducing gold is an energy-intensive business, resulting in a significant carbon footprint. Energy costs account for approximately twenty percent of our overall operating costs, with our principal energy sources being purchased electricity, diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and coal.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. At the 21st\nConference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (\u201cUNFCC\u201d) held in Paris in 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted which was intended to govern emission reductions beyond 2020. The Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016 when countries that produce at least 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions ratified the agreement. While there are no immediate impacts to business from the Paris Agreement, the goal of limiting global warming to \u201cwell below 2o C\u201d will be taken up at national levels. Industrialized nations (e.g., Australia) are likely to implement national emission reduction targets that require an investment shift towards low carbon technologies and systems, shifting away from coal and diesel power generation. The temperature change goal implies a move to net zero greenhouse gas emissions from energy use and industrial activities by 2050 to 2060. The relevant details of the shift towards low carbon technologies are defined in the national plans, which will need further definition in new rules from each country by 2020. The Trump Administration has announced the intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which begins a lengthy process that will not be completed until November 2020.\nSome of the countries in which we operate have implemented, and are developing, laws and regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. In December 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) issued an endangerment finding under the U.S. Clean Air Act that current and projected concentrations of certain mixed greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare. Additionally, the United States and China signed a bilateral agreement in November 2014 that committed the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by the year 2025. The EPA in August 2015 issued final rules for the Clean Power Plan under Section 111 (d) of the Clean Air Act designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at electric utilities in line with reductions planned for the compliance with the Paris Agreement. On October 16, 2017, the EPA as part of a regulatory review directed by the Energy Independence Executive Order has proposed a repeal of the Clean Power Plan. In Australia the Emissions Reduction Fund legislation, Safeguard Mechanism Rule 2015 came into effect on July 1, 2016. Facilities that exceed the baseline mandated by the law in future years are required to purchase Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs).\nLegislation and increased regulation and requirements regarding climate change could impose increased costs on us, our venture partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. In August 2015, the EPA issued the final rules for the Clean Power Plan under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. Under the Clean Power Plan Newmont\u2019s TS Power Plant would be subject to greenhouse gas emission reductions as part of the Nevada compliance plan. The EPA has subsequently issued the Affordable Clean Energy Rule in August 2018, which would eliminate the emission reduction standards proposed in the Clean Power Plan. The Clean Power Plan is currently in litigation in the Washington DC Circuit preventing the implementation of either rule.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. Operations that rely on national hydro-electric grid power can be adversely affected by drought resulting in power load-shedding and lost production. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.\nOur Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability.\nNewmont and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of certain of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. This leads to higher pit walls, more complex underground environments and increased exposure to geotechnical instability and hydrological impacts. As our operations are maturing, the open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper and we have experienced certain geotechnical failures at some of our mines, including, without limitation, at our operations in Australia, Nevada, Ghana, Peru and Colorado. For example, pit failures at the Silverstar pit and Gold Quarry pit of the Carlin operation in 2018 and in the eastern wall of the open pit of the KCGM operation in 2018 resulted in temporary shutdowns and have impacted production. See also the risk factor under the heading \u201cMining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate, and are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations\u201d earlier in this section.\nNo assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides and pit wall failures, will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material.\nIn addition, Newmont has numerous operational and closed tailings impoundments in a variety of climatic and topographic settings. Annually, the Company manages and places more than 100 million tonnes of tailings. Recognizing the importance of careful design, management and monitoring, Newmont conducts extensive siting, engineering, environmental and social studies to support the specific selection and design of each facility. Newmont\u2019s engineering, construction and operating standards and technical guidance explicitly cover tailings management and establish requirements throughout their operating and post-mine closure life. The design, construction and operation of all tailings impoundment facilities are scrutinized through our investment system process, supported by inspections and audits, critical controls and strict application of annual inspections by independent qualified geotechnical engineers. Newmont\u2019s environmental standards also cover the long-term management of tailings impoundment facilities. The failure of tailings dam and storage facilities and other impoundments at our mining sites could cause severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. For example, in early 2019, the extractive industry experienced a large scale tailings dam failure at an unaffiliated mine, which resulted in numerous fatalities and caused extensive property and environmental damage. Recognizing this risk, Newmont continues to review and enhance our existing practices. However, no assurance can be given that these events will not occur in the future. See also the risk factor under the heading \u201cWe may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining\u201d earlier in this section.\nGeotechnical or tailings storage facility failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs and other impacts, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nShortages of critical parts and equipment may adversely affect our operations and development projects.\nThe mining industry has been impacted, from time to time, by increased demand for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, trucks, shovels and tires. These shortages have, at times, impacted the efficiency of our operations, and resulted in cost increases and delays in construction of projects; thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and production and construction schedules.\nRisks Related to the Jurisdictions in Which We Operate\nOur operations are subject to risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions.\nExploration, development, production and mine closure activities are subject to regional, political, economic, community and other risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions, including:\n\u00b7\nPotential instability of foreign governments and changes in government policies, including relating to or in response to changes of U.S. laws or foreign policies;\n\u00b7\nExpropriation or nationalization of property;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to otherwise repatriate funds;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell gold offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such companies to hold U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts;\n\u00b7\nImport and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold and/or copper;\n\u00b7\nDisadvantages relating to submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitration panels or enforcement or appeals of judgments at foreign courts or arbitration panels against a sovereign nation within its own territory;\n\u00b7\nRoyalty and tax increases or claims, including retroactive increases and claims and requests to renegotiate terms of existing investment agreements, contracts of work, leases, royalties and taxes, by governmental entities, including such increases, claims and/or requests by the governments of Australia, Ghana, Peru, Suriname, the State of Colorado and the State of Nevada in the U.S.;\n\u00b7\nChanges in laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including in changes resulting from changes in political administrations;\n\u00b7\nRisk of loss due to inability to access our properties or operations;\n\u00b7\nOther risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in contracts with government owned entities such as unilateral cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other mining rights;\n\u00b7\nDelays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, necessary governmental permits, mining or operating leases and other agreements and/or approvals;\n\u00b7\nRisk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;\n\u00b7\nClaims for increased mineral royalties or ownership interests by local or indigenous communities;\n\u00b7\nRisk of loss due to criminal activities such as trespass, local artisanal or illegal mining, theft and vandalism;\n\u00b7\nDelays in obtaining or renewing collective bargaining or certain labor agreements;\n\u00b7\nDisadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to the rigorous laws and regulations of the U.S. or other jurisdictions, including without limitation, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Dodd-Frank Act;\n\u00b7\nIncreases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located;\n\u00b7\nIncreased financing costs;\n\u00b7\nCurrency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high inflation;\n\u00b7\nForeign exchange controls;\n\u00b7\nIncreases in costs relating to, or restrictions or prohibitions on, the use of ports for concentrate storage and shipping, such as in relation to our Boddington operation where use of alternative ports is not currently economical, or in relation to our ability to procure economically feasible ports for developing projects;\n\u00b7\nRisk of disruption, damage or failure of information technology systems, and risk of loss and operational delays due to impacts to operational technology systems, such as due to cyber-attacks, malicious software computer viruses, security breaches, design failures and natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nRisk of loss due to disease, such as malaria or the Zika virus, and other potential endemic health issues, such as Ebola; and\n\u00b7\nDisadvantage and risk of loss due to the limitations of certain local health systems and infrastructure to contain diseases and potential endemic health issues.\nConsequently, our exploration, development and production activities may be affected by these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.\nChanges in mining or investment policies or shifts in political and social attitudes in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our operations or profitability.\nOur operations may be affected in a number of ways by laws and regulations related, but not limited to: restrictions on production; price controls; export controls; import restrictions, such as restrictions applicable to, among other things, equipment, services and supplies, currency remittance, income taxes, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of mineral claims, environmental legislation, land use, surface land access, land claims of local communities, water use, and mine safety. Failure to comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in\nloss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as partners with carried or other interests, any of which may adversely affect our operations or profitability.\nIn addition, as governments continue to struggle with deficits and concerns over the potential and actual effects of depressed economic conditions, many of them have targeted the mining and metals sector in order to raise revenue. Governments are continually assessing the fiscal terms of the economic rent for a mining company to exploit resources in their countries. Numerous countries have implemented changes to their mining regimes that reflect increased government control over or participation in the mining sector, including, but not limited to, changes of law affecting foreign ownership and takeovers, mandatory government participation in mining enterprises, taxation and royalties, working conditions, rates of exchange, exchange controls, exploration licensing, export duties, repatriation of income or return of capital, environmental protection, as well as requirements intended to boost the local economy, including usage of local goods and employment of local and community staff or contractors, among other benefits to be provided to local residents. The effects of the various requirements and uncertainties related to the economic risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions cannot be accurately predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOur operations at Yanacocha and the development of our Conga project in Peru are subject to political and social unrest risks.\nDuring the last several years, Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (\u201cYanacocha\u201d), in which we own a 51.35% interest, and whose properties include the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project in Peru, has been the target of local political and community protests, some of which blocked the road between the Yanacocha mine and Conga project complexes and the City of Cajamarca in Peru and resulted in vandalism and equipment damage. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur in the future. The recurrence of significant political or community opposition or protests could continue to adversely affect the Conga Project\u2019s development and the continued operation of Yanacocha.\nConstruction activities on our Conga project were suspended on November 30, 2011, at the request of Peru\u2019s central government following increasing protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. At the request of the Peruvian central government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project, which was previously approved by the central government in October 2010, was reviewed by independent experts in an effort to resolve allegations around the environmental viability of Conga. This review concluded that the environmental impact assessment complied with international standards and provided some recommendations to improve water management. Yanacocha focused on the construction of water reservoirs prior to the development of other project facilities. However, development of Conga is contingent upon generating acceptable project returns and getting local community and government support. Under the current social and political environment, the Company does not anticipate being able to develop Conga for at least the next five years. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the project\u2019s development, the Company has allocated its exploration and development capital to other projects in recent years, and the Conga project is currently in care and maintenance. Should the Company be unable to develop the Conga project, the Company may have to consider other alternatives for the project, which may result in a future impairment charge.\nThe Central Government of Peru continued to support responsible mining as a vehicle for the growth and future development of Peru in 2018. However, we are unable to predict whether the Central government will continue to take similar positions in the future. The regional government of Cajamarca and other political parties actively opposed the Conga project in the past. We are unable to predict the positions that will be taken in the future and whether such positions or changes in law will affect Yanacocha or Conga. Such changes may include increased labor regulations, environmental and other regulatory requirements, and additional taxes and royalties, as well as future protests, community demands and road blockages. We cannot predict future positions of either the Central or regional government on foreign investment, mining concessions, land tenure or other regulation. Any change in government positions or laws on these issues could adversely affect the assets and operations of Yanacocha or Conga, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, the inability to develop Conga or operate at Yanacocha could have an adverse impact on our growth and production in the region.\nIn addition, in early 2015, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the Ministry of the Environment (\u201cMINAM\u201d), issued proposed water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria would modify the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In December 2015, MINAM issued the final regulation that modified the water quality standards. In response in February 2017, Yanacocha submitted its proposed modification to the previously approved Environmental Impact Assessment to the Mining Ministry (\u201cMINEM\u201d), which is still under review. After approval, MINEM may allow up to three years to develop and implement the modifications to the water management system. In the event Yanacocha is unsuccessful in implementing the modifications in compliance with the new regulations and deadlines, it could result in fines and\npenalties relating to potential intermittent non-compliant exceedances. In addition, if accepted the treatment options will result in increased costs. These impacts may adversely impact the future cost and financial performance of our operations in Peru.\nOur Merian operation in Suriname is subject to political and economic risks.\nWe hold a 75% interest in the Merian gold mine in the mid-eastern part of Suriname. The president of Suriname and others, including a number of members of the current administration, have been named defendants in a trial in connection with the deaths of certain political opponents in 1982. Those proceedings were previously halted based upon an executive order. However, in January 2017, a court in Suriname directed that the trial be recommenced and such trial proceeding ended on November 30, 2018. The trial entered the final stage of rendering a verdict by the court. The exact date for the judgement by the court is not yet known, but judgement is expected in the first half of 2019. The prosecutor in the trial has recommended that the current president be sentenced to 20 years prison for murder. Such a sentencing could result in civil and political instability, and heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the government and national policy impacting foreign investment and operators.\nOperations in Suriname are governed by a mineral agreement with the Republic of Suriname that establishes the terms and conditions under which Merian operations and development are conducted. The mineral agreement was approved by parliament and requires approval by parliament to change. No assurances can be made that the government will not request changes to the agreement in the future. While the government is generally considered by the Company to be mining friendly, it is possible that the current or future government may adopt substantially different policies, make changes in taxation treatment or regulations, take arbitrary action which might halt operations, increase costs, or otherwise impact mining and exploration rights and/or permits, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nThe government of Suriname previously exercised its option to participate in a fully-funded 25 percent equity ownership stake in Merian. Suriname manages its participation through Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. (\u201cStaatsolie\u201d), a Surinamese corporation that is wholly owned by the government. The Company can make no assurances that Staatsolie will have sufficient funds or borrowing ability in order to make their capital commitments in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. See the risk factor under the heading \u201cFuture funding requirements may affect our business\u201d later in this section.\nArtisanal and illegal miners have been active on, or adjacent to, the Merian mine in recent years. See the risk factor under the heading \u201cCivil disturbances, criminal activities, including illegal mining, and artisanal mining, occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties, which can disrupt business and expose the Company to liability\u201d earlier in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section for additional information.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nThe Proposed Transaction could negatively affect the price of our common stock as a response to the Proposed Transaction, significant delays in consummation of the arrangement, or the termination of the Arrangement Agreement.\nThe market price of our common stock may vary significantly from the price on the date of the Arrangement Agreement (as defined below). Negative market response to the Proposed Transaction, or any significant delays in the consummation of the arrangement could negatively affect our stock price. In addition, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the consummation of the Proposed Transaction will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. If the arrangement is not consummated or is delayed, the market price of our common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent the market price reflects a market assumption that the arrangement will be consummated or will be consummated in a particular timeframe.\nStock price changes may result from a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nmarket reaction to the announcement of the Proposed Transaction and market assessment of the likelihood of the Proposed Transaction being consummated;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the respective businesses, operations or prospects of Newmont or Goldcorp, including their respective ability to meet earnings estimates;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental or litigation developments or regulatory considerations affecting Newmont or Goldcorp or the mining industry;\n\u00b7\ngeneral business, market, industry or economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe worldwide supply/demand balance for gold and copper and the prevailing commodity price environment; and\n\u00b7\nother factors beyond our control, including those described elsewhere in, or incorporated by reference into, this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.\nThe market price and volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are:\n\u00b7\nchanges in gold, and to a lesser extent, copper prices;\n\u00b7\noperating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors or our financial outlook;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in our business or in the mining sector generally;\n\u00b7\nregulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations;\n\u00b7\nthe operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire;\n\u00b7\nresponse to activism; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock may not receive dividends.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock and our Board of Directors may modify the dividend policy or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Transaction\nAs disclosed in this Form 10-K, including in Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview,\u201d on January 14, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cArrangement\nAgreement\u201d) to acquire all outstanding common shares of Goldcorp in a primarily stock transaction. The Proposed Transaction could subject us to significant risks, including those described below.\nThe Proposed Transaction is subject to satisfaction or waiver of several conditions.\nThe Proposed Transaction is conditional upon, among other things, approval of the issuance of Newmont common stock to Goldcorp shareholders in exchange for their Goldcorp common shares pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement and authorization to amend and restate Newmont\u2019s certificate of incorporation to increase Newmont\u2019s authorized shares of common stock by Newmont\u2019s stockholders, approval of the Proposed Transaction by Goldcorp shareholders, and Newmont and Goldcorp having obtained all government or regulatory approvals required by law, policy or practice, including, without limitation, approval of competition or antitrust and/or foreign investment authorities in Canada, Mexico and Korea. There can be no assurance that any or all such approvals will be obtained.\nThe Arrangement Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances.\nEach of Newmont and Goldcorp has the right to terminate the Arrangement Agreement in certain circumstances. For instance, either party may terminate the Arrangement Agreement if the transaction has not been completed by July 31, 2019 and the parties do not mutually agree to extend the Arrangement Agreement. Failure to complete the Proposed Transaction could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock or otherwise adversely affect Newmont\u2019s business.\nIf the Proposed Transaction is not completed as a result of, among other reasons, a change in recommendation by us or a breach of a representation or warranty made by us in the Arrangement Agreement and prior to termination there is an acquisition proposal for us announced and within 12 months we enter into an agreement or consummate an acquisition proposal, we will be required to pay a termination fee of $650 to Goldcorp in connection with the termination of the Arrangement Agreement. If the termination fee is ultimately required to be paid to Goldcorp, the payment of such fee will have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe issuance of a significant number of shares of our common stock and a resulting \u201cmarket overhang\u201d could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock after completion of the Proposed Transaction.\nOn completion of the Proposed Transaction, a significant number of additional shares of our common stock will be issued and available for trading in the public market. The increase in the number of shares of our common stock may lead to sales of such shares or the perception that such sales may occur (commonly referred to as \u201cmarket overhang\u201d), either of which may adversely affect the market for, and the market price of, shares of our common stock.\nWe do not currently control Goldcorp and its subsidiaries.\nWe will not control Goldcorp and its subsidiaries until completion of the Proposed Transaction and the business and results of operations of Goldcorp may be adversely affected by events that are outside of our control during the intervening period. The performance of Goldcorp may be influenced by, among other factors, economic downturns, changes in commodity prices, political instability in the countries in which Goldcorp operates, changes in applicable laws, expropriation, increased environmental regulation, volatility in the financial markets, unfavorable regulatory decisions, litigation, rising costs, civic and labor unrest, disagreements with joint venture partners, delays in ongoing exploration and development projects and other factors beyond our control. As a result of any one or more of these factors, among others, the operations and financial performance of Goldcorp may be negatively affected, which may adversely affect the future financial results of the combined company.\nGoldcorp and Newmont may be the targets of legal claims, securities class actions, derivative lawsuits and other claims and negative publicity related to the Proposed Transaction.\nGoldcorp and Newmont may be the target of securities class actions and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Proposed Transaction. Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into an agreement to acquire a public company or to be acquired. Third parties may also attempt to bring claims against Newmont or Goldcorp seeking to restrain the Proposed Transaction or seeking monetary compensation or other remedies. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Proposed Transaction, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Proposed Transaction.\nIn addition, political and public attitudes towards the Proposed Transaction could result in negative press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting Newmont and Goldcorp. Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements could lead to investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in legal claims or otherwise negatively impact the ability of the combined company to take advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Arrangement and the integration of Goldcorp may not occur as planned.\nThe Proposed Transaction has been agreed with the expectation that its completion will result in an increase in sustained profitability, cost savings and enhanced growth opportunities for the combined company. These anticipated benefits will depend in part on whether Goldcorp\u2019s and Newmont\u2019s operations can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner. A significant number of operational and strategic decisions and certain staffing decisions with respect to integration of the two companies have not yet been made. These decisions and the integration of the two companies will present challenges to management, including the integration of systems and personnel of the two companies which may be geographically separated, anticipated and unanticipated liabilities, unanticipated costs (including substantial capital expenditures required by the integration) and the loss of key employees.\nThe performance of the combined company\u2019s operations after completion of the Proposed Transaction could be adversely affected if, among other things, the combined company is not able to achieve the anticipated savings and synergies expected to be realized in entering the Proposed Transaction, or retain key employees to assist in the integration and operation of Goldcorp and Newmont. The consummation of the Proposed Transaction may pose special risks, including one-time write-offs, restructuring charges and unanticipated costs. In addition, the integration process could result in diversion of the attention of management and disruption of existing relationships with suppliers, employees, customers and other constituencies of each company. Although Newmont and its advisors have conducted due diligence on the operations of Goldcorp, there can be no guarantee that Newmont is aware of any and all liabilities of Goldcorp. As a result of these factors, it is possible that certain benefits expected from the combination of Goldcorp and Newmont may not be realized.\nGoldcorp\u2019s public filings are subject to Canadian disclosure standards, which differ from SEC disclosure requirements.\nOur reserve estimates have been prepared in accordance with Industry Guide 7 published by the SEC. We have not been involved in the preparation of Goldcorp\u2019s mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates. Goldcorp\u2019s mineral reserves and mineral resource estimates were prepared in accordance with the disclosure standards of National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) and the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy Classification system under Canadian securities laws, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws.\nIndustry Guide 7 and NI 43-101 have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported, but embody different approaches and definitions. For example, the terms \u201cMineral Reserve,\u201d \u201cProven Mineral Reserve\u201d and \u201cProbable Mineral Reserve\u201d are Canadian mining terms as defined in NI 43-101, and these definitions differ from the definitions in Industry Guide 7. The terms \u201cmineral resource,\u201d \u201cmeasured mineral resource,\u201d \u201cindicated mineral resource\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resource\u201d are defined in and required to be disclosed in accordance with NI 43-101, but these terms are not defined terms under Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. \u201cInferred mineral resources\u201d under NI 43-101 have a great amount of uncertainty as to the existence of such resources and their economic and legal feasibility. A significant amount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an inferred mineral resource may be upgraded to a higher category. By contrast, under Industry Guide 7 standards, a \u201cfinal or \u201cbankable\u201d feasibility study is typically required to report reserves or cash flow analysis to designate reserves. Further, under Industry Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as a \u201creserve\u201d unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.\nExpectations regarding the combined mineral reserves and mineral resources of Newmont and Goldcorp following the closing of the Proposed Transaction will remain subject to adjustment, pending continuing review of Goldcorp\u2019s mineral resources in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7 standards. Future adjustment may occur due to differing standards, required study levels, price assumptions, future divestments and acquisitions and other factors.\nThe combined company will face political risks in new jurisdictions.\nGoldcorp\u2019s principal operations, development and exploration activities and significant investments are held in Canada, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, and the Dominican Republic, some of which may be considered to have an increased degree of political and sovereign risk. Any material adverse changes in government policies or legislation of such countries or any other country that Goldcorp has economic interests in may affect the viability and profitability of the combined company following the Proposed Transaction.\nWhile the governments in Canada, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, the Dominican Republic and other countries in which Goldcorp has mining operations or development or exploration projects have historically supported the development of natural resources by foreign companies, there is no assurance that such governments will not in the future adopt different regulations policies or interpretations with respect to, but not limited to, foreign ownership of mineral resources, royalty rates, taxation, rates of exchange, environmental protection, labor relations, repatriation of income or return of capital, restrictions on production or processing, price controls, export controls, currency remittance, or the obligations of Goldcorp under its respective mining codes and stability conventions. The possibility that such governments may adopt substantially different policies or interpretations, which might extend to the expropriation of assets, may have a material adverse effect on the combined company following the Proposed Transaction. Political risk also includes the possibility of terrorism, civil or labor disturbances and political instability. No assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining authorizations nor can assurance be given that such exploration and mining authorizations will not be challenged or impugned by third parties. The effect of any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreased exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and capital controls may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s earnings and the value of some of the combined company\u2019s assets.\nOur reporting currency is the US dollar and the majority of our earnings and cash flows are denominated in US dollars. The operations of Goldcorp are also conducted in US dollars, but Goldcorp conducts some of its business in currencies other than the US dollar and, as a result, following the Proposed Transaction, the combined company\u2019s consolidated earnings and cash flows may be impacted by movements in the exchange rates to a greater extent than prior to the Proposed Transaction. In particular, any change in the value of the currencies of the Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso, the Dominican Peso, the Argentine Peso, or the Chilean Peso versus the US dollar following the Proposed Transaction could negatively impact the combined company\u2019s earnings, and could negatively impact the combined company\u2019s ability to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Transaction.\nIn addition, from time to time, emerging market countries such as those in which the combined company will operate adopt measures to restrict the availability of the local currency or the repatriation of capital across borders. These measures are imposed by governments or central banks, in some cases during times of economic instability, to prevent the removal of capital or the sudden devaluation of local currencies or to maintain in-country foreign currency reserves. In addition, many emerging markets countries require consents or reporting processes before local currency earnings can be converted into U.S. dollars or other currencies and/or such earnings can be repatriated or otherwise transferred outside of the operating jurisdiction. These measures may have a number of negative effects on the combined company, reduction of the immediately available capital that the combined company could otherwise deploy for investment opportunities or the payment of expenses. In addition, measures that restrict the availability of the local currency or impose a requirement to operate in the local currency may create other practical difficulties for the company.\nNew legislation and tax risks in certain Goldcorp operating jurisdictions.\nGoldcorp has operations and conducts business in a number of jurisdictions in which we do not currently operate or conduct business, which may increase our susceptibility to sudden tax changes. Taxation laws of these jurisdictions are complex, subject to varying interpretations and applications by the relevant tax authorities and subject to changes and revisions in the ordinary course. Any unexpected taxes imposed on the combined company could have a material and adverse impact on the combined company.\nFailure by Goldcorp to comply with applicable laws prior to the Proposed Transaction could subject the combined company to adverse consequences following the Proposed Transaction.\nGoldcorp is subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada). The foregoing laws prohibit companies from making improper payments to\nofficials, require the maintenance of records and require adequate internal controls. Following the Proposed Transaction, the combined company may be liable for any violation of the foregoing laws attributable to Goldcorp prior to the Proposed Transaction.\nGoldcorp is also subject to a wide variety of laws relating to the environment, health and safety, taxes, employment, labor standards, money laundering, terrorist financing and other matters.\nFailure by Goldcorp to comply with any of the foregoing legislation prior to the Proposed Transaction could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and may subject the combined company to other liabilities, including fines, prosecution and reputational damage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition of the combined company. The compliance mechanisms and monitoring programs adopted and implemented by Goldcorp prior to the Proposed Transaction may not adequately prevent or detect possible violations of such applicable laws. Investigations by governmental authorities related to any actual or perceived violation of the foregoing laws could also have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition of the combined company.", "PERMNO": 21207, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "NEM"}
