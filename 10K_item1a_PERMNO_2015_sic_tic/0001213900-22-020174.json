{"cik": "1566826", "company": "LogicMark, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors, both those that are known to us and identified below and others that may arise from time to time. These risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those suggested by forward-looking statements in this Report and elsewhere, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any of these risk factors should occur, moreover, the trading price of our securities could decline, and investors in our securities could lose all or part of their investment in our securities. These risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our prospects.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe are uncertain of our ability to generate sufficient revenue and profitability in the future.\nWe continue to develop and refine our business model, but we can provide no assurance that we will be able to generate a sufficient amount of revenue, from our business in order to achieve profitability. It is not possible for us to predict at this time the potential success of our business. The revenue and income potential of our proposed business and operations are currently unknown. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, you may lose some or all of your investment in our Company.\nThe Company generated an operating loss of $7,547,456 and a net loss of $11,707,889 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to an operating loss and a net loss of $586,078 and $2,864,984 as of December 31, 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and stockholders\u2019 equity of $12,044,415 and $26,589,171, respectively, compared to cash and stockholders\u2019 equity of $4,387,416 and $9,159,211 as of December 31, 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021, the Company had working capital of $13,098,049, compared to a working capital deficit as of December 31, 2020 of $578,795. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise additional cash from equity financings, secure debt financing, and/or generate revenue from the sales of our products. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to curtail our research and development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, other pandemics, epidemics or other adverse public health developments.\nThe pandemic resulting from COVID-19 has caused many governments to implement quarantines and significant restrictions on travel, and to advise that people remain at home where possible and avoid crowds. This has caused much business disruption and uncertainty in the financial markets. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our distributors and/or the VHA have, for various extended periods, significantly reduced orders for our products. Continuing effects of COVID-19, or other pandemics, epidemics or other adverse public health developments, may in all likelihood, extend these reduced product orders and continue the inability of our distributors and/or the VHA to pay us for orders for an undeterminable period of time. Delays and disruptions, such as difficulty obtaining components and temporary suspension of operations, have resulted in our existing inventory levels not being sufficient, and our business, financial condition and results of operations have been materially and adversely affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event that such material business disruptions continue, this will, in all likelihood, have a material adverse impact on our business and we may be forced to write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and may not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. As a result of COVID-19 or future adverse public health developments, we have been and may also continue to be impacted by shutdowns, employee illness and other community response measures meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19, all of which has and may continue to negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if we are regularly unable to meet our obligations to deliver our products to distributors and/or the VHA, they may decide to terminate or reduce their distribution arrangements with us and our business could be adversely affected. Accordingly, our securityholders could suffer a reduction in the value of our securities that they hold if the trading price of our Common Stock is adversely impacted due to such market perceptions. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and will include emerging information concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by governments and private businesses to attempt to contain such virus.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or security breaches could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, among other things, trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information). It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information. Attacks on information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and they are being conducted by increasingly sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, and the large amounts of confidential information stored on those systems, make such systems vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors, and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems, or those of our third-party vendors, or security breaches could materially adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information, including, among other things, trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company\u2019s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us or any third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants to comply with our privacy, confidentiality, data security or similar obligations to third parties, or any data security incidents or other security breaches that result in the unauthorized access, release or transfer of sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation or public statements against us, could cause third parties to lose trust in us or could result in claims by third parties asserting that we have breached our privacy, confidentiality, data security or similar obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, data security incidents and other security breaches can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm. To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. While we have implemented data security measures intended to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent service interruptions or data security incidents. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial losses.\nDefects or disruptions in our products or services could diminish demand for such products or services and subject us to substantial liability.\nAs our products and services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party software, such products or services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our products and services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. Such defects could also create vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data. However, any defect or disruption in our products or services in the future could materially affect our business, reputation or financial results.\nOur supply chains in Hong Kong subject us to risks and uncertainties relating to the laws and regulations of China and the changes in relations between the United States and China.\nUnder its current leadership, the government of China has been pursuing economic reform policies, including by encouraging foreign trade and investment. However, there is no assurance that the Chinese government will continue to pursue such policies, that such policies will be successfully implemented, that such policies will not be significantly altered, or that such policies will be beneficial to our supply chains in China. China\u2019s system of laws can be unpredictable, especially with respect to foreign investment and foreign trade. The United States government has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy with China and has raised (as well as has proposed to further raise in the future), tariffs on several Chinese goods. China has retaliated with increased tariffs on United States goods. Moreover, China\u2019s legislature has adopted a national security law to substantially change the way Hong Kong has been governed since the territory was handed over by the United Kingdom to China in 1997. This law increases the power of the central government in Beijing over Hong Kong, limits the civil liberties of residents of Hong Kong and could restrict the ability of businesses in Hong Kong to continue to conduct business or to continue to conduct business as previously conducted. The U.S. State Department has indicated that the United States no longer considers Hong Kong to have significant autonomy from China and former presidential administration implemented an executive order revoking Hong Kong\u2019s preferential trade status. The United States currently imposes the same tariffs and other trade restrictions on exports from Hong Kong that it places on goods from mainland China. Any further changes in United States trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, including China, resulting in trade wars. Any changes in United States and China relations may have a material adverse effect on our supply chains in China which could materially harm our business and financial condition.\nThe recent COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, and China\u2019s policy of a full shutdown of the economy where COVID-9 strikes, may lead to both short-term and medium-term challenges to our supply chain, both in terms of cost and availability.\nIf we fail to keep pace with changing industry technology and consumer preferences, we will be at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe industry segments in which we are operating evolve rapidly and are characterized by continuous change, including rapid product evolution and rapidly changing industry standards and end-user/consumer preferences. In order to continue to compete effectively in these markets, we need to respond quickly to technological changes and to understand their impact on our customers\u2019 preferences. It may take significant time and resources to respond to these technological changes. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or within reasonable cost parameters, or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems, our business may suffer. Moreover, developments by others may render our technologies and intended products noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors. If any of our competitors implement new technologies before we are able to implement them, those competitors may be able to provide more effective products than ours. Any delay or failure in the introduction of new or enhanced products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our inability to keep pace with changing industry technology and consumer preferences may cause our inventory to become obsolete at a rate faster than anticipated, which may result in our taking goodwill impairment charges in past or future acquisitions that negatively impact our results of operations. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system or technology and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could impair our operating results.\nIf we cannot obtain additional capital required to finance our research and development efforts and sales and marketing efforts, our business may suffer and our securityholders may lose the value of their investment in the Company.\nWe may require additional funds to further execute our business plan and expand our business. If we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed, we may have to restructure our business or delay or abandon our development and expansion plans. We will have ongoing capital needs as we expand our business. If we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible securities, our securityholders\u2019 ownership percentage of our Common Stock will be reduced. In addition, these transactions may dilute the value of our Common Stock. We may have to issue securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our Common Stock. The terms of any additional indebtedness may include restrictive financial and operating covenants that would limit our ability to compete and expand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional financing we may need to fund our business, or that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us\nWe face intense competition in our market, especially from larger, well-established companies, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\nA number of other companies engage in the business of developing applications for PERS. The market for such products is intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants. Our current competitors include both emerging or developmental stage companies as well as larger companies. Many of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:\n\u25cf Greater name recognition and longer operating histories;\n\u25cf Larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;\n\u25cf Broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and end-customers;\n\u25cf Greater customer support resources;\n\u25cf Greater resources to make acquisitions;\n\u25cf Larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and\n\u25cf Substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources.\nIn addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products, including through selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling, or closed technology platforms. Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. New start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our products and technology. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources.\nOur markets are subject to technological change and our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products.\nEach of the governmental and commercial markets for our products is characterized by:\n\u25cf Changing technologies;\n\u25cf Changing customer needs;\n\u25cf Frequent new product introductions and enhancements;\n\u25cf Increased integration with other functions; and\n\u25cf Product obsolescence.\nOur success will be dependent in part on the design and development of new products. To develop new products and designs for our target markets, we must develop, gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost-effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise. The product development process is time-consuming and costly, and there can be no assurance that product development will be successfully completed, that necessary regulatory clearances or approvals will be granted on a timely basis, or at all, or that the potential products will achieve market acceptance. Our failure to develop, obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for, or successfully market, potential new products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims by others that we infringe on their intellectual property rights could increase our expenses and delay the development of our business. As a result, our business and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nOur industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents as well as frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe on issued patents, patents that may be issued in the future, or other intellectual property rights of others.\nWe do not have the resources to conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringe on patents held by third parties. In addition, product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed.\nWe may face claims by third parties that our products or technology infringe on their patents or other intellectual property rights. Any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is invalid, and could distract our management. If any of our products are found to violate third-party proprietary rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages. In addition, we may be required to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products. Any efforts to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful, which would prevent us from selling our products, and, in any case, could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.\nOur ability to compete for government contracts is affected, in part, by our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and non-disclosure and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite these efforts, we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or protect that proprietary information. The validity and breadth of claims in technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, may be highly uncertain. Nor can we assure you that, if challenged, our patents will be found to be valid or enforceable, or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business. In addition, the enforcement of laws protecting intellectual property may be inadequate to protect our technology and proprietary information.\nWe may not have the resources to assert or protect our rights to our patents and other intellectual property. Any litigation or proceedings relating to our intellectual property, whether or not meritorious, will be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel.\nWe also rely on other unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets and know-how and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology, techniques or processes, that such technology or know-how will not be disclosed or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to such unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, or know-how. To date, we have not entered into any non-disclosure agreements with our employees. Although we intend to enter into non-disclosure agreements with all of our consultants, there can be no assurance that such non-disclosure agreements will provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary know-how.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain new patents.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patent and trade secret protection for proprietary technology that we currently possess or that we may develop in the future. No assurance can be given that any pending or future patent applications will be issued to us as patents, that the scope of any patent protection obtained will be sufficient to exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us, that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged or that others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held by us.\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that our competitors have not or will not independently develop technology, processes or products that are substantially similar or superior to ours, or that they will not duplicate any of our products or design around any patents issued or that may be issued in the future to us. In addition, whether or not patents are issued to us, others may hold or receive patents which contain claims having a scope that covers products or processes developed by us.\nWe may not have the resources to adequately defend any patent infringement litigation or proceedings. Any such litigation or proceedings, whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us, is costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. In addition, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights from third parties. There can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on acceptable terms if at all. If we do not obtain required licenses, we could encounter delays in product development or find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses could be foreclosed. Accordingly, challenges to our intellectual property, whether or not ultimately successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur future success depends on the continued service of management, engineering and sales and marketing personnel and our ability to identify, hire and retain additional personnel.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, upon the efforts and abilities of members of senior management. We have not entered into employment agreements with most of our key employees, which we believe presents a greater risk of losing some of these key employees, than if we had employment agreements with them. The loss of the services of one or more of our senior management or other key employees could adversely affect our business. There is intense competition for qualified employees in our industry, particularly for highly skilled design, applications, engineering and salespeople. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain developers, managers, or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace qualified individuals who may leave us at any time in the future. Our anticipated growth is expected to place increased demands on our resources and will likely require the addition of new management and engineering staff as well as the development of additional expertise by existing management employees. If we lose the services of or fail to recruit engineers or other technical and management personnel, our business could be materially harmed.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our current litigation with certain stockholders of Fit Pay, Inc.\nOn February 24, 2020, Michael J. Orlando (\u201cOrlando\u201d), as purported shareholder representative (the \u201cShareholder Representative\u201d), and other former stockholders of Fit Pay, Inc. (collectively, the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, CrowdOut Capital, LLC (\u201cCrowdOut\u201d) and Garmin International, Inc. (\u201cGarmin\u201d). Plaintiff\u2019s Second Amended Complaint, dated July 30, 2020 (the \u201cComplaint\u201d), alleges that the Company breached certain contractual obligations under a merger agreement, dated May 23, 2017, between Fit Pay, Inc. and the Company, regarding certain future, contingent earnout payments. The Complaint sought unspecified monetary damages from the defendants. In an Amended Answer and Counterclaim filed September 9, 2020, the Company denied all liability and sought, inter alia, damages caused by Orlando\u2019s alleged wrongdoing. On October 15, 2020, the court authorized the Company to make a motion for summary judgment and stayed all discovery pending resolution of, among other things, that motion. On March 31, 2022, the court granted the Company\u2019s motion of summary judgment and also dismissed the Company\u2019s counterclaims, thus concluding the litigation.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual and current reports with the SEC with respect to our business and operating results. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increases demand on our systems and resources.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in this Report and in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition is more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert resources of our management and harm our business and operating results.\nPeriods of rapid growth and expansion could place a significant strain on our resources, including our employee base, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe may experience periods of rapid growth and expansion, which may place a significant strain and demands on our management, our operational and financial resources, customer operations, research and development, sales and marketing, administrative, and other resources. To manage our possible future growth effectively, we will be required to continue to improve our management, operational and financial systems. Future growth would also require us to successfully hire, train, motivate and manage our employees. In addition, our continued growth and the evolution of our business plan will require significant additional management, technical and administrative resources. If we are unable to manage our growth successfully, we may not be able to effectively manage the growth and evolution of our current business and our operating results could suffer.\nWe depend on contract manufacturers, and our production and products could be harmed if they are unable to meet our volume and quality requirements and alternative sources are not available.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. If such services by any contract manufacturer become unavailable, we would be required to identify and enter into an agreement with a new contract manufacturer or take such manufacturing in-house. The loss of any of our contract manufacturers could significantly disrupt production as well as increase the cost of production, thereby increasing the prices of our products. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are presently a small company with too limited resources and personnel to establish a comprehensive system of internal controls. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we would not be able to accurately report our financial results on a timely basis or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our brand and operating results would be harmed. We may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. For example, because of size and limited resources, our external auditors have determined that we lack the personnel and infrastructure necessary to properly carry out an independent audit function. Although we believe that we have adequate internal controls for a company with our size and resources, we are not certain that the measures that we have in place will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, would harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls would also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would have a negative effect on our company and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had identified certain matters that constituted material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. See Item 9A of this Report for further discussion on our internal controls. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nDue to recent disruption in the financial markets, our business, liquidity and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nRecent disruption in the financial markets, particularly the volatility of the stock market and the scarcity of capital available to smaller businesses, could adversely affect us, primarily through limiting our access to capital and disrupting our clients\u2019 businesses. In addition, continuation or worsening of general market conditions in economies important to our businesses may adversely affect our clients\u2019 level of spending and ability to obtain financing, leading to us being unable to generate the levels of sales that we require. Current and continued disruption of financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe may seek or need to raise additional funds. Our ability to obtain financing for general corporate and commercial purposes or acquisitions depends on operating and financial performance and is also subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We face the risk that we may not be able to access various capital sources, including investors, lenders or suppliers. The global credit markets and the financial services industry are experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or sale of various financial institutions. An unprecedented level of intervention from the U.S. and other governments has been seen. As a result of such disruption, our ability to raise capital may be severely restricted and the cost of raising capital through such markets or privately may increase significantly at a time when we would like, or need, to do so. Failure to access the equity or credit markets from any of these sources could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. Any of these events could have an impact on our flexibility to fund our business operations, make capital expenditures, pursue additional expansion or acquisition opportunities, or make another discretionary use of cash and could adversely impact our financial results.\nThe uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has also caused greater volatility in the financial markets. A change or disruption in the global financial markets for any reason, including the COVID-19 pandemic or other adverse public health developments, may cause consumers, businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to tighter credit, decreased cash availability and declining consumer confidence. Accordingly, demand for our products could decrease and differ materially from current expectations. Further, some of our customers may require substantial financing in order to fund their operations and make purchases from us. The inability of these customers to obtain sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us or possible insolvencies of our customers could result in decreased customer demand, an impaired ability for us to collect on outstanding accounts receivable, significant delays in accounts receivable payments, and significant write-offs of accounts receivable, each of which could adversely impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Products\nOur products and technologies may not be accepted by the intended commercial consumers of our products, which could harm our future financial performance.\nThere can be no assurance that our PERS will achieve wide acceptance by commercial consumers of such healthcare products, and/or market acceptance generally. The degree of market acceptance for products and services based on our technology will also depend upon a number of factors, including the receipt and timing of regulatory approvals, if any, and the establishment and demonstration of the ability of our proposed device to provide the level of confidence and independence in an efficient manner and at a reasonable cost. Our failure to develop a commercial product to compete successfully with existing medical technologies could delay, limit or prevent market acceptance. Moreover, the market for new PERS is largely undeveloped, and we believe that the overall demand for such response systems technology will depend significantly upon public perception of the need for such a level of assistance. There can be no assurance that the public will believe that our products are necessary or that the medical industry will actively pursue our technology as a means to solve such issues. Long-term market acceptance of our products and services will depend, in part, on the capabilities, operating features and price of our products and technologies as compared to those of other available products and services. As a result, there can be no assurance that currently available products, or products under development for commercialization, will be able to achieve market penetration, revenue growth or profitability.\nOur PERS may become obsolete if we do not effectively respond to rapid technological change on a timely basis.\nThe medical and two-way voice communication industries are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product innovations, changes in customer requirements and expectations and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to keep pace with these changes, our business may be harmed. Products using new technologies, or emerging industry standards, could make our technologies less attractive. In addition, we may face unforeseen problems when developing our products, which could harm our business. Furthermore, our competitors may have access to technologies not available to us, which may enable them to produce products of greater interest to consumers or at a more competitive cost.\nOur business model is evolving. Because of the evolving nature of healthcare technology, it is difficult to predict the size of this specialized market, the rate at which the market for our PERS will grow or be accepted, if at all, or whether other healthcare technologies will render our applications less competitive or obsolete. If the market for our healthcare products fails to develop or grows slower than anticipated, we would be significantly and materially adversely affected.\nIf our products and services do not achieve market acceptance, we may never have significant revenues or any profits.\nIf we are unable to operate our business as contemplated by our business model or if the assumptions underlying our business model prove to be unfounded, we could fail to achieve our revenue and earnings goals within the time we have projected, or at all, which would have a detrimental effect on our business. As a result, the value of any investment in our Company could be significantly reduced or completely lost.\nWe may fail to create new products, provide new services and enter new markets, which would have an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to develop and market our technology other than those currently intended. If we fail in these goals, our business strategy and ability to generate revenues and cash flow would be significantly impaired. We intend to expend significant resources to develop new technology, but the successful development of new technology cannot be predicted, and we cannot guarantee we will succeed in these goals.\nOur products may have defects, which could damage our reputation, decrease market acceptance of our products, cause us to lose customers and revenue and result in costly litigation or liability.\nOur products may contain defects for many reasons, including defective design or manufacture, defective material or software interoperability issues. Products as complex as those we offer, frequently develop or contain undetected defects or errors. Despite testing defects or errors may arise in our existing or new products, which could result in loss of revenue, market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation and increased service and maintenance cost. Defects or errors in our products and solutions might discourage customers from purchasing future products. Often, these defects are not detected until after the products have been shipped. If any of our products contain defects or perceived defects or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems or perceived problems, our reputation might be damaged significantly, we could lose or experience a delay in market acceptance of the affected product or products and we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers. In addition, these defects could interrupt or delay sales. In the event of an actual or perceived defect or other problem, we may need to invest significant capital, technical, managerial and other resources to investigate and correct the potential defect or problem and potentially divert these resources from other development efforts. If we are unable to provide a solution to the potential defect or problem that is acceptable to our customers, we may be required to incur substantial product recall, repair and replacement and even litigation costs. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe provide warranties on certain product sales and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale. The determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or to replace the products under warranty. We will establish warranty reserves based on our best estimates of warranty costs for each product line combined with liability estimates based on the prior twelve months\u2019 sales activities. If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates, adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required in future periods. In addition, because our customers rely on secure authentication and identification of cardholders to prevent unauthorized access to programs, PCs, networks, or facilities, a malfunction of or design defect in its products (or even a perceived defect) could result in legal or warranty claims against us for damages resulting from security breaches. If such claims are adversely decided against us, the potential liability could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Furthermore, the possible publicity associated with any such claim, whether or not decided against us, could adversely affect our reputation. In addition, a well-publicized security breach involving smart card-based or other security systems could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of products like ours in general, or our products in particular, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products. Any of the foregoing events could cause demand for our products to decline, which would cause its business and operating results to suffer.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nThe market price for our Common Stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company with a small and thinly traded public float, and lack of profits, which could lead to wide fluctuations in the price of our Common Stock.\nThe market for our Common Stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to the securities of larger, more established companies that have large public floats, and we expect that the price of our Common Stock will continue to be more volatile than the securities of such larger, more established companies for the indefinite future. The volatility in the price of our Common Stock is attributable to a number of factors. First, as noted above, our Common Stock is, compared to the securities of such larger, more established companies, sporadically and thinly traded. The price of our Common Stock could, for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of shares of our Common Stock is sold on the market without commensurate demand. Secondly, we are a speculative or \u201crisky\u201d investment due to our lack of profits to date. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares of Common Stock on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the securities of a larger, more established company that has a large public float. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our Common Stock regardless of our operating performance.\nBecause of volatility in the stock market in general, the market price of our Common Stock will also likely be volatile.\nThe stock market in general, and the market for stocks of healthcare technology companies in particular, has been highly volatile. As a result, the market price of our Common Stock is likely to be volatile, and investors in our Common Stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of their shares of Common Stock or the loss of their entire investment for a number of reasons, including reasons unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. The market price of our Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a broad and diverse range of factors, including those described elsewhere in this Report, including this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, and the following:\n\u25cf Recent price volatility and any known risks of investing in our Common Stock under these circumstances;\n\u25cf The market price of our Common Stock prior to the recent price volatility;\n\u25cf Any recent change in financial condition or results of operations, such as in earnings, revenues or other measure of company value that is consistent with the recent change in the prices of our Common Stock; and\n\u25cf Risk factors addressing the recent extreme volatility in stock price, the effects of a potential \u201cshort squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand for our Common Stock as a result of current investor exuberance associated with healthcare- or technology-related stocks, to the extent that the Company expects to conduct additional offerings in the future to fund its operations or provide liquidity, the dilutive impact of those offerings on investors that receive shares of our Common Stock in connection with those offerings at a significantly higher price.\nIf and when a larger trading market for our Common Stock develops, the market price of our Common Stock is still likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, and you may be unable to resell your shares of Common Stock at or above the price at which you acquired them.\nThe market price of our Common Stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf Variations in our revenues and operating expenses;\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our Common Stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally;\n\u25cf Market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole;\n\u25cf Actual or expected changes in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u25cf Developments in the financial markets and worldwide or regional economies;\n\u25cf Announcements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf Announcements by the government relating to regulations that govern our industry;\n\u25cf Sales of our Common Stock or other securities by us or in the open market;\n\u25cf Changes in the market valuations of other comparable companies; and\n\u25cf Other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19, and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of our suppliers or result in political or economic instability.\nIn addition, if the market for technology and/or healthcare stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or operating results. The trading price of our Common Stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry, even if these events do not directly affect us. Each of these factors, among others, could harm the value of your investment in our Common Stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common Stock could be delisted from such exchange.\nOur Common Stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements.\nUntil recently, we had not been in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d) for the continued listing of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which requires our listed Common Stock to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. On November 3, 2021, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC acknowledging that we had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, as a result of our ability to meet a set of conditions set forth by the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC after we had previously fallen out of compliance with such rule. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to remain in compliance with the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC\u2019s listing standards or if we do later fail to comply with such standards, that we will subsequently regain compliance with such listing standards. If we are unable to maintain compliance with these Nasdaq requirements, our Common Stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. Further, in the event that our Common Stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market due to our failure to continue to comply with such standards, and our Common Stock is not eligible for quotation on another market or exchange, trading of our Common Stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our Common Stock, and it would likely be more difficult to obtain coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market or another national exchange.\nIn the event that our Common Stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, U.S. broker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in shares of our Common Stock because they may be considered penny stocks and thus be subject to the penny stock rules.\nThe SEC has adopted a number of rules to regulate \u201cpenny stock\u201d that restricts transactions involving stock which is deemed to be penny stock. Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. These rules may have the effect of reducing the liquidity of penny stocks. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market if current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). Our shares of Common Stock have in the past constituted, and may again in the future constitute, \u201cpenny stock\u201d within the meaning of the rules. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon U.S. broker-dealers may discourage such broker-dealers from effecting transactions in shares of our Common Stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of such shares of Common Stock and impede their sale in the secondary market.\nA U.S. broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or \u201caccredited investor\u201d (generally, an individual with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations require the U.S. broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, a disclosure schedule prepared in accordance with SEC standards relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A U.S. broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the U.S. broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a U.S. broker-dealer is required to submit monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in a customer\u2019s account and information with respect to the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d.\nStockholders should be aware that, according to the SEC, the market for \u201cpenny stocks\u201d has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include: (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) \u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced salespersons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, resulting in investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our Common Stock could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the near future to continue our planned operations. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Common Stock.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds, finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing securities that would dilute the ownership of the Common Stock. Depending on the terms available to us, if these activities result in significant dilution, it may negatively impact the trading price of our shares of Common Stock.\nThe issuance of material amounts of Common Stock by us would cause our existing stockholders to experience significant dilution in their investment in us. We have financed our operations, and we expect to continue to finance our operations, acquisitions, if any, and the development of strategic relationships by issuing equity and/or convertible securities, which could significantly reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Further, any additional financing that we secure may require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to, or pari passu with, those of our Common Stock. Additionally, we may acquire other technologies or finance strategic alliances by issuing our equity or equity-linked securities, which may result in additional dilution. Any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on the ownership interest of existing stockholders, which could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. We may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt or the issuance or sale of other securities or instruments senior to our shares of Common Stock. The holders of any securities or instruments that we may issue may have rights superior to the rights of our existing stockholders. If we experience dilution from issuance of additional securities and we grant superior rights to new securities over such stockholders, it may negatively impact the trading price of our shares of Common Stock. In addition, if we obtain additional financing involving the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 investment would be further diluted. Such dilution could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, which could impair our ability to raise additional financing.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future; you should not expect dividends if you hold shares of our Common Stock.\nThe payment of dividends on our Common Stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our Common Stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nSubject to the payment of dividends on our shares of Series C Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, we currently intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe could issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting then current stockholder interests and impairing their voting rights; and provisions in our charter documents could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board. Our Board is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue a series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, our common stockholders. The issuance of a series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. For example, it would be possible for our Board to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of the Company. The Series C Preferred Stock currently ranks senior to the Common Stock and our Series F Preferred Stock, and any class or series of capital stock created after the Series C Preferred Stock and has a special preference upon the liquidation of the Company. The Series F Preferred Stock currently ranks senior to the Common Stock and any class or series of capital stock created after the Series F Preferred Stock and has a special preference upon the liquidation of the Company. For further information regarding our shares of (i) Series C Preferred Stock, please refer to the Certificate of Designation filed as an exhibit to, and the disclosure contained in, the Series C Certificate of Designations filed as an exhibit to, and the disclosure contained in, our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 30, 2017 and (ii) Series F Preferred Stock, please refer to the Form of Series F Certificate of Designation filed as an exhibit to, and the disclosure contained in, our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 17, 2021.\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u201cFINRA\u201d) sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our Common Stock.\nFINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for certain customers. FINRA requirements will likely make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in our Common Stock. As a result, fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our Common Stock, reducing a stockholder\u2019s ability to resell shares of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 14934, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "NXTD"}
