These risks could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Please consider each of the risks described below, along with other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when making any investment decisions with respect to our securities.\nOur Enterprise Risk Management process seeks to identify and address material risks. We believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of operating a global business and, in particular, one focused on growth and cost-competitiveness. Our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning, while preserving and enhancing shareholder value. However, the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this report, as well as other risks currently unknown or deemed immaterial at the date of this report, could adversely affect us and cause our financial results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results.\nA.\nMARKET RISKS\nEconomic Uncertainties\nThe military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in geopolitical instability. Our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by the negative impacts on the global economy resulting from the conflict in Ukraine.\nIn February 2022, Russian troops invaded Ukraine and the military conflict is ongoing. While the length and total impact of the military conflict is unpredictable, it has led to market disruptions, including volatility in raw material prices and credit and capital markets, and supply chain challenges. In response to the military conflict, governments in the U.S. and abroad have imposed sanctions against Russia and proposed or threatened additional potential sanctions. These sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets in which we operate.\nWe do not have manufacturing operations in Ukraine or Russia nor any significant business relationships with Ukraine- or Russian-based customers or suppliers. To date, we have not experienced any material impacts of the ongoing military conflict. We are monitoring the situation and its impact on the global markets, which may, in turn, impact our business. For example, it is possible that the conflict could result in lower automotive production in Europe if supply parts and raw materials for OEMs become less available or if there are continued significant increases in energy and fuel prices. In addition, the threat of cyberattacks on the global supply chain may increase, which could directly or indirectly impact our operations.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. It is not possible to predict the extent and duration of the military conflict, sanctions, and any associated market disruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and associated supply chain challenges could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nSince its onset, the COVID-19 pandemic has broadly impacted the global economy and our key end markets. During fiscal 2022, the direct effects on our company from the COVID-19 pandemic generally lessened, particularly compared with the significant impacts during the first half of fiscal 2021.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and other market and economic dynamics have contributed to global supply chain challenges, labor shortages and inflationary market conditions. Raw material and logistic prices have increased and we, like many companies, have experienced delays and shortages in certain purchased commodities and components. In addition, our Automotive segment has been impacted by lower order volume associated with semiconductor shortages, which have caused lower global automotive production. While we are focused on mitigating the negative impacts of the labor shortages and supply chain challenges, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful, and the pandemic and related market dynamics could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nSince February 2022, COVID-19 cases have increased in many areas in China. As a result of government-required lock-downs, we suspended production at manufacturing facilities in China for portions of March and April 2022. While these plants have since reopened, they are currently manufacturing at reduced levels and customer demand has been negatively impacted by the lock-downs and supply chain challenges, including component shortages. While we are actively working to address the supply chain challenges and expect to increase production levels at our plants in China in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. All of our other manufacturing locations are open and operating, although production has been negatively affected at times by employee absences due to COVID-19. Our business operations could be further affected if any of our key management or leadership personnel are incapacitated or if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to illness, quarantines, government actions or similar pandemic-related impediments.\nAt this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or the ongoing supply chain challenges, the full extent of which will depend largely on future developments which are unpredictable and outside of our control. If we, our suppliers, or our customers experience prolonged shutdowns or other significant business disruptions, it is possible that our ability to conduct business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA future widespread outbreak of an illness or other public health threat could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAn outbreak of a disease or public health threat in the future could create economic and financial disruptions and adversely affect our businesses around the world. Potential impacts of epidemics, pandemics, or other health crises include, but are not limited to, (i) staffing shortages if portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures, or other restrictions; (ii) short- or long-term disruptions in our supply chain and our ability to deliver products to our customers; (iii) deterioration in the markets that we or our customers operate in, which may result in lower sales or a lack in the ability of our customers to pay us; and (iv) significant volatility or negative pressure in the financial markets, which could adversely affect our access to capital and/or financing.\nCustomer and Supplier Matters\nIncreases in costs of materials, including aluminum, copper, steel and stainless steel (nickel), other raw materials and purchased components, could place significant pressure on our results of operations.\nIncreases in the costs of raw materials and other purchased components, which may be impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in trade laws, tariffs, sanctions, inflation, the behavior of our suppliers and significant fluctuations in demand, could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. In the shorter-term, our ability to adjust for cost increases is limited when prices are fixed for current orders. In these cases, if we are not able to recover such cost increases through price increases to our customers, such cost increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations. With regard to our longer-term sales programs, we have sought to reduce the risk of cost increases by including provisions within our customer contracts, where possible, which provide for prospective price adjustments based upon increases and decreases in the cost of key raw materials. However, where these contract provisions are applicable, there can often be a three-month to one-year lag until the time of the price adjustment. To further mitigate our exposure, from time to time we enter into forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted aluminum and copper purchases. However, these hedges may only partially offset increases in material costs, and significant increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components or materials from our suppliers.\nIn an effort to manage and reduce our costs while balancing supply risk, we have added key suppliers to our supply base during the last year. We are, however, still dependent upon limited sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products, including aluminum, copper, steel and stainless steel (nickel). We select our suppliers based upon total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities, financial condition and willingness and ability to meet our demand. In some cases, it can take several months or longer to find a supplier due to qualification requirements.\nStrong demand, the potential effects of trade laws and tariffs, capacity constraints, financial instability, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, or other circumstances experienced by our suppliers could result in shortages or delays in their supply of product to us, or a significant price increase resulting in our need to resource. If we experience significant or prolonged shortages of any critical components or materials from our suppliers and could not procure the components or materials from other sources, we may be unable to meet our production schedules and could miss product delivery dates, which would adversely affect our sales, results of operations and customer relationships.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by price reduction pressures from OEMs.\nAlthough we have been successful in negotiating price increases in many of our contracts in response to the current inflationary market conditions, we have historically faced price-reduction pressure from our vehicular OEM customers. Virtually all of these OEMs have imposed aggressive price-reduction initiatives upon their suppliers. We have taken, and will continue to take, steps to reduce our operating costs to offset both inflationary pressures and contractual price reductions in order to achieve profit margins that are acceptable to us. For existing contractual price reductions, if we are unable to offset price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and manufacturing processes, sourcing alternatives, technology enhancements and other cost reduction initiatives, or through price negotiations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe expect vehicular OEM customers will continue to apply pricing pressure and many will require contractual price reductions for new sales programs. As part of our application of the 80/20 principles, we have improved our pricing discipline and have clear strategic targets in terms of profit margins for new sales programs. If contractual price downs are unavoidable, we contemplate them in our overall strategy and adjust pricing as necessary to provide satisfactory profit margins throughout the duration of the sales programs. While we believe that this pricing strategy will strengthen our business and allow us to focus our resources on higher margin sales programs, it is possible that it may result in a lower overall win rate for new business in the short-term. If our pricing strategy results in winning less new business, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur net sales and profitability could be adversely affected from business losses or declines with major customers.\nDeterioration of a business relationship with a major customer could cause our sales and profitability to suffer. In certain areas of our businesses, a large portion of sales are attributable to a relatively small number of customers. In our vehicular businesses, the failure to obtain new business on new models or to retain or increase business on redesigned existing models could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, as a result of the relatively long lead times required for many of our complex components, it may be difficult in the short term for us to obtain new sales to replace any unexpected decline in sales of existing products. The loss of a major customer in any of our businesses, the loss of business with respect to one or more of the vehicle models that use our vehicular products, or a significant decline in the production levels of such vehicles could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nContinual customer pressure to absorb costs adversely affects our profitability.\nVehicular customers often request that we pay for design, engineering and tooling costs that are incurred prior to the start of production and recover these costs through amortization in the piece price of the product. Some of these costs cannot be capitalized, which adversely affects our profitability until the programs for which they have been incurred are launched. If a given program is not launched, or is launched with significantly lower volumes than planned, we may not be able to recover the design, engineering and tooling costs from our customers, further adversely affecting our results of operations.\nClimate Change and ESG-Related Risks\nGlobal climate change and related emphasis on ESG matters by various stakeholders could negatively affect our business.\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Such regulatory uncertainty extends to our product portfolio and overall costs of compliance, which may impact the demand for our products and/ or require us to make increased capital expenditures to meet new standards and regulations. Further, our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions or other environmental standards upon us through regulation, market-based emissions policies or consumer preference that we may not be able to timely meet, or which may not be economically feasible for us, due to the required level of capital investment or technological advancement.\nThere is a growing consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to global climate changes. Climate changes, such as extreme weather conditions, create financial risk to our business. For example, the demand for our products and services may be affected by unseasonable weather conditions. Climate changes could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain, and process disruptions due to climate changes could result in price modifications for our products and the resources needed to produce them.\nFurthermore, customer, investor, and employee expectations in areas such as the environment, social matters and corporate governance (ESG) have been rapidly evolving and increasing. Specifically, certain customers are requiring information on our environmental sustainability plans and commitments, which we have not yet released publicly as of the date of this filing. There can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our future plans or commitments will be achieved, or that any investments we make in furtherance of achieving any such plans, targets, goals or other commitments will meet customer, investor, employee or other stakeholder expectations and desires or any legal standards regarding sustainability performance.\nAdditionally, the enhanced stakeholder focus on ESG issues requires the continuous monitoring of various and evolving standards and the associated reporting requirements. A failure to adequately meet stakeholder expectations may result in the loss of business, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract and retain customers or an inability to attract and retain top talent.\nCompetitive Environment\nContinued and increased strong competition could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nThe global competitive environment continues to be dynamic as many of our customers, faced with intense international competition, have expanded their sourcing of components. As a result, we experience competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates, lower costs associated with legal compliance, and, in some cases, export or raw materials subsidies. In addition, consolidation and vertical integration within the supply base have introduced new or restructured competitors to our markets. Increased competition could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nB.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nComplexities of Global Presence\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations and global customer base.\nWe have manufacturing and technical facilities located in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. In fiscal 2022, 60 percent of our sales were generated from customers outside the U.S., with 53 percent of these sales generated by our non-U.S. operations. Consequently, our global operations are subject to complex international laws and regulations and numerous risks and uncertainties, including changes in monetary and fiscal policies, including those related to tax and trade, cross-border trade restrictions or prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, inflation, changing economic conditions, public health crises, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems, insufficient infrastructures, social unrest, political instability and disputes (including, for example, impacts of the military conflict in Ukraine), incompatible business practices, and international terrorism. Changes in policies or laws governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we either manufacture products, such as Mexico, or buy raw materials, such as China, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, compliance with multiple and often conflicting laws and regulations of various countries can be challenging and expensive.\nEmbargoes or sanctions imposed by the U.S. government or those abroad that restrict or prohibit sales to or purchases from specific persons or countries or based upon product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions to the extent that we are alleged or found to be in violation, whether intentional or unintentional. Governments in the U.S. and abroad have imposed sanctions on Russia in connection with the military conflict in Ukraine. While we do not have manufacturing operations in Ukraine or Russia nor any significant business relationships with Russian-based customers or suppliers, we are actively monitoring the sanctions requirements and reacting as necessary to ensure compliance. We cannot predict future regulatory requirements to which our business operations may be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making payments to improperly influence foreign government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. In the event that we believe our employees or agents may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, or if we are subject to allegations of any such violations, we may have to expend significant time and financial resources towards the investigation and remediation of the matter, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nChallenges of Maintaining a Competitive Cost Structure\nWe may be unable to maintain competitive cost structures within our business.\nIn recent years, we have engaged in various restructuring activities in order to optimize our manufacturing footprint and cost structure. These restructuring activities have included targeted headcount reductions that support our objective of reducing operational and SG&A cost structures and the consolidation and/or closure of manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition, we continue to focus on reducing costs for materials and services through targeted adjustments and negotiations with our supply base. Our successful execution of these initiatives, and our ability to identify and execute future opportunities to optimize our cost structures, is critical to enable us to establish a cost structure that will improve and sustain our long-term competitiveness. Any failure to do so could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChallenges of Program Launches\nWe launch a significant number of new programs at our facilities across the world. The success of these launches is critical to our business.\nWe design technologically advanced products, and the processes required to produce these products can be difficult and complex. We spend significant time and financial resources to ensure the successful launch of new products and programs. Due to our high level of launch activity, particularly within our HDE segment, we must appropriately manage these launches and deploy our operational and administrative resources to take advantage of the resulting increase in our business. If we do not successfully launch new products and programs, we may lose market share or damage relationships with our customers, which could negatively affect our business. In addition, any failure in our manufacturing strategy for these new products or programs could result in operating inefficiencies or asset impairment charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nInformation Technology (IT) Systems\nWe may be adversely affected by a substantial disruption in, or material breach of, our IT systems.\nWe are dependent upon our IT infrastructure, including network, hardware, and software systems, to conduct our business. Despite network and other cybersecurity measures we have in place, our IT systems could be compromised or we could experience a cybersecurity breach from computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, break-ins or similar disruptions. A substantial disruption in our IT systems for a prolonged time period, or a material breach of our IT systems, could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders, and/or the release of otherwise confidential information, including personal information that is protected by the General Data Protection Regulation, adversely affecting our customer service and relationships as well as our reputation, and could lead to significant remediation expenses and litigation risks. Our systems, and the systems of our service providers or others, could be breached, damaged or interrupted by cyber-attacks or other man-made intentional or unintentional events, or by natural disasters or occurrences, many of which may, despite our best efforts, be beyond our ability to effectively detect, anticipate or control. This impact may be heightened by the increased disbursement of our workforce resulting from our own and from government efforts to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the military conflict in Ukraine and the associated political uncertainty may increase the threat of cyberattacks on the global supply chain, which could directly or indirectly impact our operations. Any such events and the related delays, problems or costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety Regulations\nWe could be adversely impacted by the costs of environmental, health and safety regulations.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. The operation of our manufacturing facilities entails risks in these areas and there can be no assurance we will avoid material costs or liabilities relating to such matters. Our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property may extend to previously-owned or used property, properties owned by unrelated companies, as well as properties we currently own and use, regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners. In addition, potentially material expenditures could be required in order for our products and operations to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations (including those developed as a concern to climate control), or other requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Future costs to remediate contamination or to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nClaims and Litigation\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty and product liability claims and litigation or other legal proceedings.\nIn the event our products fail to perform as expected, we are exposed to warranty and product liability claims and may be required to participate in a recall or other field campaign of such products. Many of our vehicular customers offer extended warranty protection for their vehicles and require their supply base to extend warranty coverage as well. If our customers demand higher warranty-related cost recoveries, or if our products fail to perform as expected, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We are also involved in various legal proceedings from time to time incidental to our business. If any such proceeding has a negative result, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nC.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nBusiness Optimization and Growth Strategies\nInability to execute on our strategic initiatives may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nWe are well on our way in our strategic transformation. We have onboarded seasoned leaders with the requisite experience to drive transformative change, including two new segment presidents as well as general managers focused on market-based verticals within our business. Our leadership teams are driving change by applying 80/20 principles to our business. We are analyzing our business to better focus resources on products and markets with the highest growth opportunities and best return profiles. We plan to continue to employ an 80/20 mindset to optimize profit margins and cash flow. If we are unable to successfully apply the 80/20 principles to our businesses and execute on our strategic initiatives, we may not achieve the financial or operational successes anticipated.\nIn addition, we will continue to review our business portfolio and pursue acquisitions to accelerate growth. There can be no assurance we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets. If we are unable to successfully execute on organic growth opportunities or complete acquisitions in the future, our growth may be limited. In addition, future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, finance, and administrative functions. If we are unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions and operate these businesses profitably, we may not achieve the financial or operational success expected from the acquisitions.\nD.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nLiquidity and Access to Cash\nOur indebtedness may limit our use of cash flow to support operating, development and investment activities, and failure to comply with our debt covenants could adversely affect our liquidity and financial results.\nAs of March 31, 2022, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $378 million. Our indebtedness and related debt service obligations (i) require that significant cash flow from operations be used for principal and interest payments, which reduces the funds we have available for other business purposes; (ii) limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (iii) expose us to interest rate risk, since the majority of our debt obligations carry variable interest rates.\nOur credit and Senior Note agreements contain financial covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and impose a maximum leverage ratio. Failure to comply with debt covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and interest rates.\nMarket trends and regulatory requirements may require additional funding for our pension plans.\nOur defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. are frozen to new participants. Our funding policy is to contribute annually, at a minimum, the amount necessary on an actuarial basis to provide for benefits in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Our domestic plans have an unfunded liability totaling $22 million as of March 31, 2022. As a result of funding relief provisions within the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, we do not expect to make cash contributions to our U.S. plans during fiscal 2023. Funding requirements for our defined benefit plans are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns, mortality rate assumptions, and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes. Should changes in actuarial assumptions or other factors result in the requirement of significant additional funding contributions, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nOur balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. An impairment of a significant portion of these assets would adversely affect our financial results.\nOur balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets totaling $258 million at March 31, 2022. We perform goodwill impairment tests annually, as of March 31, or more frequently if business events or other conditions exist that require a more frequent evaluation. In addition, we review intangible assets for impairment whenever business conditions or other events indicate that the assets may be impaired. If we determine the carrying value of an asset is impaired, we write down the asset to fair value and record an impairment charge to current operations.\nWe use judgment in determining if an indication of impairment exists. For our annual goodwill impairment tests, we use significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates and operating profit margins to calculate estimated future cash flows and risk-adjusted discount rates. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events or circumstances, including lower than forecasted revenues, market trends that fall below our current expectations, actions of key customers, increases in discount rates, and the continued general economic uncertainties and impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the military conflict in Ukraine, which could adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIncome Taxes\nWe may be subject to additional income tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nThe subjectivity of or changes in tax laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we have significant operations could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are also subject to tax audits in each jurisdiction in which we operate. Unfavorable or unexpected outcomes from one or more tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, as of March 31, 2022, our net deferred tax assets totaled $21 million. Each quarter, we evaluate the probability that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determine whether valuation allowances or adjustments thereto are needed. This determination involves judgement and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including expectations of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Future events or circumstances, such as lower taxable income or unfavorable changes in the financial outlook of our operations in certain jurisdictions, could require us to establish further valuation allowances, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nE.\nGENERAL RISKS\nCustomers and Markets\nWe are dependent upon the health of the customers and markets we serve.\nWe are highly susceptible to unfavorable trends or disruptions in the markets we serve, as our customers\u2019 sales and production levels are affected by general economic conditions, including supply chain challenges, access to credit, the price of fuel and electricity, employment levels and trends, interest rates, labor relations issues, regulatory requirements, government-imposed restrictions relating to health crises or other unusual events, trade agreements and other market factors, as well as by customer-specific issues. Any significant decline in production levels for current and future customers could result in asset impairment charges and a reduction in our sales, thereby adversely impacting our results of operations and financial condition.\nExposure to Foreign Currencies\nAs a global company, we are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations, which affect our financial results.\nAlthough our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in foreign currencies. Our sales and profitability are affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we generate sales and incur expenses. To the extent that we are unable to match sales in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our financial results. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported sales and earnings from our international operations will be lower because the applicable local currency will be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. In certain instances, currency rate fluctuations may create pricing pressure relative to competitors quoting in different currencies, which could result in our products becoming less competitive. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nReliance upon Technology Advantage\nIf we cannot differentiate ourselves from our competitors with our technology, our existing and potential customers may seek lower prices and our sales and earnings may be adversely affected.\nPrice, quality, delivery, technological innovation, and application engineering development are the primary elements of competition in our markets. If we fail to keep pace with technological changes and cannot differentiate ourselves from our competitors with our technology or fail to provide high quality, innovative products and services that both meet or exceed customer expectations and address their ever-evolving needs, we may experience price erosion, lower sales, and lower profit margins. Significant technological developments by our competitors or others also could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDevelopments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nWe own and license significant intellectual property, including a large number of patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve. As we maintain or expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite our efforts to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAttracting and Retaining Talent\nOur continued success is dependent on being able to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel.\nOur ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, develop, and retain skilled and diverse personnel throughout our organization. We depend significantly on the engagement of our employees and their skills, experience and industry knowledge to support our objectives and initiatives. We have recently observed tightening and increased competitiveness in the labor markets and have experienced labor shortages at certain of our manufacturing locations. Any prolonged labor shortages or significant employee turnover could negatively impact productivity and result in increased labor costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand or increased wage rates necessary to attract and retain employees. Overall, difficulty in attracting, developing, and retaining qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 54704, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "MOD"}
