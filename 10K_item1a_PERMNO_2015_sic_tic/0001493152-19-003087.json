{"cik": "1317945", "company": "Omega Flex, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A - RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors and all the other information contained in this annual report and our other filings in evaluating our business and investment in our common stock. We have not disclosed general risk factors that may be applicable to any for-profit organization, such as general economic conditions, interest rates, labor supply and technological changes. Investors are cautioned to take into consideration the specific risk factors we have disclosed below and general risk factors before making an investment decision.\nRisk Relating to Our Business\nWe are primarily dependent on one product line for most of our sales.\nMost of the Company\u2019s sales are derived from the sale of TracPipe\u00ae and CounterStrike\u00ae flexible gas piping systems, including Autoflare\u00ae and AutoSnap\u00ae fittings and a variety of accessories. Sales of our flexible metal hose for other applications represent a small portion of our overall sales and income. Any event or circumstance that adversely affects our TracPipe\u00ae or CounterStrike\u00ae flexible gas piping could have a greater impact on our business and financial results than if our business were more evenly distributed across several different product lines. The effects of such an adverse event or circumstance would be magnified in terms of our Company as a whole as compared to one or more competitors whose product lines may be more diversified, or who are not as reliant on the sales generated by their respective flexible gas piping products. Therefore, risks relating to our TracPipe\u00ae and CounterStrike\u00ae flexible gas piping business - in particular loss of distributors or sales channels, technological changes, changes in applicable code requirements, loss of our key personnel involved in the flexible gas piping product line, increases in commodity prices, particularly in stainless steel and polyethylene - could pose a significant risk to our competitive position, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur manufacturing plant(s) may be damaged or destroyed.\nThe majority of the company\u2019s manufacturing capacity is currently located in Exton, Pennsylvania, where we own two manufacturing facilities which are in close proximity to each other, and in Banbury, United Kingdom where we rent a manufacturing facility. On a smaller scale the Company also manufactures product in Houston, Texas. We do not have any operational manufacturing capacity for flexible metal hose outside of these locations. We cannot replicate our manufacturing methods at a supplier\u2019s facility due to the confidential and proprietary nature of our manufacturing process. If one of the manufacturing facilities were destroyed or damaged in a significant manner, we would likely experience a delay or some interruption of our flexible metal hose operations. This could lead to a reduction in sales volume if customers were to purchase their requirements from our competitors, claims for breach of contract by certain customers with contracts for delivery of flexible metal hose by a certain date, and costs to replace our destroyed or damaged manufacturing capacity. The fittings and accessories for the flexible metal hose are manufactured for us by suppliers not located in Exton, Pennsylvania, and the company also has outside warehouses which contain finished goods inventory. Disruption of or damage to our supply of these items could damage our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are dependent on certain raw materials and supplies that could be subject to volatile price escalation.\nAs a manufacturer of flexible metal hose, we must use certain raw materials in the manufacture of the hose. The primary raw material is stainless steel that is used in the forming of the hose, and various other steel products used in the wire braid overlay over some flexible metal hoses for additional strength and durability, as well as copper alloy for MediTrac\u00ae CMT. We also use polyethylene in pellet form for the forming and extrusion of a polyethylene jacket over CSST for use in fuel gas applications, underground installations, and other installations that require that the metal hose be isolated from the environment. Finally, we also purchase our proprietary brass fittings used with the flexible metal hose that provide a mechanical means of attaching the hose to an assembly or junction. We attempt to limit the effects of volatile raw material prices, and to ensure adequate and timely supply of material, by committing to annual purchase contracts for the bulk of our steel and polyethylene requirements, and for our fitting requirements. The contracts typically represent a significant portion of the Company\u2019s annual planned usage, and are set at a designated fixed price or a range of prices. These agreements sometimes require the Company to accept delivery of the commodity in the quantities committed, at the agreed upon prices. Transactions in excess of the pre-arranged commitments are conducted at current market prices at the Company\u2019s discretion. The Company has identified multiple qualified vendors to produce or manufacture our critical purchase requirements. The Company does however tend to rely on one or two sources for each or our primary components to leverage the relationship and pricing. Therefore, there is no assurance that the Company would be able to eliminate all or most of the adverse effects of a sudden increase in the cost of materials or key components, or that the loss of one or more of our key sources would not lead to higher costs or a disruption in our business.\nSusceptibility of litigation and significant legal costs or settlements.\nIn the ordinary and normal conduct of the Company\u2019s business, it is subject to periodic lawsuits, investigations and claims (collectively, the \u201cClaims\u201d). The Company has continued to receive repeat pattern Claims relating to our flexible gas piping products, although the pace of the new Claims has declined. While the Company does not believe the Claims have legal merit, and has successfully defended itself vigorously against such Claims, there is no guarantee that the pace of claims will not increase or subside. Any significant increase in the number of Claims, the financial magnitude of Claims brought against the Company, the costs of defending the Claims, particularly under higher retentions of the Company\u2019s current product liability insurance policies, could have a detrimental impact on the Company\u2019s business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition, perhaps materially.\nWe face intense competition in all of our markets.\nThe markets for flexible metal hose are intensely competitive. There are a number of competitors in all markets in which we operate, and generally none of these markets have one dominant competitor - rather a large number of competitors exist, each having a proportion of the total market. One or more of our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective or which may cost less than our current or future products, or could potentially render our products noncompetitive or obsolete. Our prior success has been due to our ability to develop new products and product improvements, and establish and maintain an effective distribution network which to some extent came at the expense of several competing manufacturers. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if we are unable to maintain and develop our competitive products.\nWe may not retain our independent sales organizations.\nAlmost all of the Company\u2019s products and product lines are sold by outside sales organizations. These independent sales organizations or sales representatives are geographically dispersed in certain territorial markets across the United States, Canada and elsewhere. These outside sales organizations are independent of us, and are typically owned by the individual principals of such firms. We enter into agreements with such outside sales organizations for the exclusive representation or distribution of our products, but such agreements are generally for terms of one year or less. At the expiration of the agreement, the agent or distributor may elect to represent a different manufacturer. As a result, we have no ability to control which flexible metal hose manufacturer any such sales organization may represent or carry. The competition to retain quality outside sales organizations is also intense between manufacturers of flexible metal hose since it is these sales organizations that generally can direct the sales volume to distributors and, ultimately, contractors and installers in important markets across the country, and in other countries in which we operate. The failure to obtain the best outside sales organization within a particular geographic market can limit our ability to generate sales of our products. While we currently have a fully developed sales and distribution network of superior outside sales organizations, there can be no assurance that any one or more of the outside sales organizations will elect to remain with us, or that our competitors will not be able to disrupt our distribution network by causing one or more of our sales representatives to drop our product lines. Our business, competitive position, results of operation or financial condition could be negatively impacted if we cannot maintain adequate sales and distribution networks.\nWe are dependent on certain sales channels for a significant portion of our business.\nOf the various sales channels that we use to sell our products, a significant portion of such sales are made through our wholesale stocking distributors that include Ferguson Enterprises and several other distributors. These and other distributors purchase our products, and stock the goods in warehouses for resale, either to their own local branches or to end-users. Because of the breadth and penetration of the distribution networks, and the range of complementary products they offer for sale, these wholesale distributors are able to sell large amounts of our products to end users across the United States and Canada. The decision by a major wholesaler distributor to stop distributing our products such as TracPipe\u00ae and CounterStrike\u00ae flexible gas piping, and to distribute a competitive flexible gas piping product, could significantly affect our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business may be subject to the supply and availability of fuel gas supplies and infrastructure.\nOur TracPipe\u00ae and CounterStrike\u00ae flexible gas piping products are used to convey fuel gas, primarily natural gas, but also propane, within a building from the exterior wall of the building to any gas-fired appliances within the building. Because those products are used in the transmission of fuel gas, the applications are limited to geographic areas where such fuel gas is available. Certain geographic areas of the United States and other countries do not have the infrastructure to make natural gas available. Other types of fuel gas may be used in areas where there are no natural gas pipelines, but these alternate fuel gas sources have other distribution issues that may constrict their availability. Our prospects for future growth of the TracPipe\u00ae and CounterStrike\u00ae products are largely limited to those areas that have natural gas transmission lines available for use in residences and commercial buildings.\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to compete as effectively.\nWe possess a wide array of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and applications for the above, as well as trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, and other proprietary information. Certain of these intellectual property rights form the basis of our competitive advantage in the market place through a superior product design, a superior business process, superior manufacturing methods or other features that provide an advantage over our competitors. The intellectual property rights are sometimes subject to infringement or misappropriation by other organizations, and failing an amiable resolution, we may be forced to resort to legal proceedings to protect our rights in such intellectual property.\nIn the past, the Company has needed to protect itself and resort to legal action, in one instance regarding a trade secret, and in another where we sued a flexible gas pipe competitor for infringement on one or more of our U.S. patents covering our AutoFlare\u00ae fittings. In both instances, the Company received favorable rulings, thus solidifying the validity of our intellectual property. Although the Company has had past success, the results we may obtain from resorting to any such legal proceedings are never assured, and it is possible that an adverse decision may be delivered in any particular proceeding. As a result, we may not be able to retain the exclusive rights to utilize and practice such intellectual property rights, and one or more of our competitors could utilize and practice such intellectual property rights. This development may lessen our competitive advantage vis-\u00e0-vis one or more competitors, and lead to a reduction in sales volume in one or more product lines, a reduction in profit margin in such product lines, or both.\nIf we were to lose the services of one or more of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy\nOur future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. The senior executives are critical to the development of our products and our strategic direction, and have a keen knowledge of business operations and processes. Their unique abilities, experience and expertise cannot be easily duplicated or replaced. As much as possible, senior executives strive to educate and develop other layers of staff and succession planning, but the loss of any of our senior management could seriously harm our business.\nCertain of our competitors may have greater resources, or they may acquire greater resources.\nSome of our competitors have substantially more resources than are available to us as a stand-alone company. For example, in the CSST market, two of our competitors are divisions of large corporations with revenues measured in the billions of dollars. These competitors may be able to devote substantially greater resources to the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of their products than would be available to us as a stand-alone company. One or more competitors may acquire several other competitors, or may be acquired by a larger entity, and through a combination of resources be able to devote additional resources to their businesses. These additional resources could be devoted to product development, reduced costs in an effort to obtain market share, greater flexibility in terms of profit margin as part of a larger business organization, increased investment in plant, machinery, distribution and sales concessions. As a stand-alone company, the resources that may be devoted by us to meet any potential developments by larger, well-financed competitors may be limited.\nWe may substantially increase our debt in the future, or be restricted from accessing funds.\nWe are currently not carrying any long-term debt, although the Company has a line of credit facility available for use as described in Note 5 of the financial statements. We may consider borrowing funds for purposes of working capital, capital purchases, research and development, potential acquisitions and business development. If we do use credit facilities, interest costs associated with any such borrowings and the terms of the loan could potentially adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, the current line of credit has debt covenants associated with it which may restrict the level of borrowing the Company may take on. Lack of access to financing, or desirable terms or at all, could damage our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.\nBorrowings under our line of credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR. LIBOR and certain other interest \u201cbenchmarks\u201d may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021, and it is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will evolve. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future debt obligations may be adversely affected.\nOur business may be subject to varying demands based on market interest rates.\nOur TracPipe\u00ae and CounterStrike\u00ae flexible gas piping products are used in the construction industry, both in residential, commercial and industrial segments, for the piping of fuel gas within a building. The demand for new or remodeled construction in the construction industry - and in particular the residential construction industry - is susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates charged by banks and other financial institutions as well as consumer demand. The purchasers of new or remodeled construction generally finance the construction or acquisition of the residential, commercial or industrial buildings, and any increase in the interest rates on such financing will raise the acquisition cost of the potential purchaser. While interest rates have been reasonably low over the recent past, they have increased slightly over the last year. If costs increase significantly, a higher amount of potential buyers may not be able to support the level of financing under a higher interest rate environment. Increased acquisition costs may lead to a decline in the demand for new or remodeled construction, and as a result may also lead to a reduced demand for our products used in construction industry.\nOur business may be subject to cyclical demands.\nThe demand for our products may be subject to cyclical demands in the markets in which we operate. Our customers who use our products in industrial and commercial applications are generally manufacturing capital equipment for their customers. Similarly, our TracPipe\u00ae and CounterStrike\u00ae flexible gas piping products are used primarily in residential construction, both in single-family buildings, and in larger multi-unit buildings. Should there be any change in factors that affect the rate of new residential construction, our growth rate would likely be impacted. To the extent that interest rates increase, in conjunction with an economic cycle or as part of the general economic conditions in the United States or abroad, the demand for our products in such applications may decrease as well.\nOur business may be subject to seasonal or weather related factors.\nThe demand for our products may be affected by factors relating to seasonal demand for the product, or a decline in demand due to inclement weather. Our TracPipe\u00ae and CounterStrike\u00ae flexible gas piping products are installed in new or remodeled buildings, including homes, apartment buildings, office buildings, warehouses, and other commercial or industrial buildings. Generally, the rate of new or remodeled buildings in the United States and in the other geographic markets in which we are present decline in the winter months due to the inability to dig foundations, problems at the job site relating to snow, or generally due to low temperatures and stormy weather. As the rate of construction activity declines during the winter, the demand for our corrugated stainless steel tubing may also decrease or remain static.\nThe concentration of ownership of our common stock may depress its market price.\nApproximately 71% of the issued and outstanding common stock is owned or controlled by inside affiliated parties to the Company, with the largest being: The Estate of John E. Reed, Stewart B. Reed, Kevin R. Hoben and Mark F. Albino. Stewart B. Reed currently serves on the Board of Directors, where he presided as Chairman until December 2018, and Mr. Hoben and Mr. Albino also serve on the Board of Directors, and are officers of the Company. Mr. Hoben was elevated to Chairman in December 2018. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of reducing the volume of trading of the common stock on the NASDAQ, which could result in lower prices for the common stock because there is not a sufficient supply of shares to create a vibrant market for our shares on the NASDAQ.\nThe concentration of ownership of common stock could exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including takeover attempts.\nBecause of their significant ownership of our common stock, our officer and directors and their respective affiliates may, as a practical matter, be able to exert influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations. This concentration also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company.\nThe impact of currency volatility.\nThe Company has operations in the United Kingdom, and does business transactions elsewhere in the world outside of the United States. While the magnitude of these transactions outside of the United States have thus far not been significant, and typically not in currencies of high volatility, it is possible that they could be material. In June 2016, the United Kingdom made the decision to leave the European Union, an event commonly known as Brexit. As a result of Brexit, and the political and economical uncertainty that ensued, the British Pound weakened in comparison to other currencies. This in turn had a direct negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements and results, as we experienced losses when settling transactions in other currencies, and experienced unfavorable results due to the translation of financial statements with a lower exchange rate. During 2017 and 2018 the impact of currency volatility on the financial statements was not as severe, but going forward, it is possible that the British Pound, other currencies that we engage in, or even the US Dollar may weaken, and materially impact the financial position, operations and liquidity of the Company.\nCybersecurity.\nIn recent years, the topic of cybersecurity, or the lack thereof, has been an issue of high concern. The Company currently maintains a robust firewall and other safeguards to either prevent or detect against nefarious actors looking to breach or infiltrate our data, and has backup systems in place. The Company\u2019s website is housed and maintained by a third party who maintain their own controls. The Company currently has a very low volume of sales coming through the internet, and processes very few credit card transactions. While it currently appears that the Company has a low level of risk related to cybercrime, the vulnerability still exists and could affect the Company negatively.\nBrexit.\nThe Company\u2019s main operating subsidiary, Omega Flex Limited, is headquartered in Banbury, England. The result of the referendum held by the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) has created a level of uncertainty regarding the final terms of that withdrawal that has not yet been agreed upon by the United Kingdom and the European Union. If there are no negotiated terms of withdrawal reached by the parties by March 29, 2019 (the Brexit deadline), then one possible result of that impasse could be the re-imposition of border and customs controls on the movement of people and goods between the United Kingdom and European Union, and the rest of the world. These border and customs controls could increase costs on materials imported into the United Kingdom and finished goods exported from the United Kingdom. In addition, it is possible that logistical delays created by those controls could delay shipments of materials and supplies into the Banbury manufacturing plant, and could also affect our ability to ship goods to customers outside of the UK, into the European Union, Africa, and the Near East. Omega Flex Limited has stockpiled materials and supplies for its manufacturing operations in Banbury ahead of the Brexit deadline, and are positioned to stage some finished goods inventory in warehouses in the European Union, in an attempt to cushion the possible impact of the re-imposition of boarder and customs\u2019 controls. Most of the business of Omega Flex Limited is domestic, and should therefore not be unduly disrupted. However, the macroeconomic effects of Brexit on the economies of the United Kingdom and the European Union are unknown, and those effects could dampen economic activity and the overall demand for the Company\u2019s products in those markets. However, it is not expected that increased costs, logistical delays, nor possible economic declines in those markets would be material to the Company.\nOur business may be subject to macroeconomic effects caused by increased trade tariffs and reduced international trade.\nRecent events have caused various governments around the world to impose increased trade tariffs on imported goods. These increased tariffs may cause the cost of materials to rise and may add additional expense on exported goods. However, the company does not believe that increased tariffs will materially affect the company\u2019s sales or operating margins, as most of the raw materials and supplies used to manufacture our products are sourced domestically in the United States. Further, exports of our flexible gas piping products from our Exton, Pennsylvania facility are primarily to Canada, which recently agreed to a revised North American trade treaty, and to a lesser extent to the Caribbean and South America. Sales to Europe, Asia and Africa are primarily handled from our Banbury, England facility, which are not affected by U.S. trade tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, but may be subject to other constraints as discussed in the Brexit risk factor, above.", "PERMNO": 90868, "SIC": 3490, "TIC": "OFLX"}
