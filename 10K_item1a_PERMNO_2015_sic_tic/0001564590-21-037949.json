{"cik": "110621", "company": "RPM INTERNATIONAL INC/DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-07-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us, our business and your investment in us because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\nECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC RISKS\nThe Covid pandemic has disrupted our operations, has had and continues to have an adverse effect on our business, and could adversely affect our business in the future.\nThe Covid pandemic has had and continues to have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The Covid pandemic has disrupted our operations and will likely continue to affect our business for an indeterminable period of time because of its continuing impact on the global economy, including its effects on transportation networks, raw material availability, product production efforts and customer demand for our products. Our ability to predict and respond to future changes resulting from the Covid pandemic, is uncertain. The Covid pandemic has resulted in increased stress to our operations that could increase our risk of plant or equipment availability issues that, if one were to occur, could be material. Even after the Covid pandemic subsides, there may be long-term effects on our business practices and customers in economies in which we\noperate that could severely disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. As we cannot predict the duration, scope or severity of the Covid pandemic, the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material.\nOur operations have been and could continue to be adversely affected by global market and economic conditions in ways we may not be able to predict or control.\nGlobal and regional economic uncertainty continues to exist, including uncertainty relating to the Covid pandemic. Our operations could be adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions if markets were to decline in the future, whether related to the Covid pandemic, higher inflation or interest rates, recession, natural disasters, impacts of climate change, Brexit, business disruptions, our ability to adequately staff operations or otherwise. Any future economic declines may result in decreased revenue, gross margins, earnings or growth rates or difficulty in managing inventory levels or collecting customer receivables. We also have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increased competitive pricing pressure and raw material inflation and availability issues resulting in difficulties meeting customer demand. In addition, customer difficulties in the future could result from economic declines, the Covid pandemic, the cyclical nature of their respective businesses, such as in the oil and gas industry, or otherwise and, in turn, result in decreases in product demand, increases in bad debt write-offs, decreases in timely collection of accounts receivable and adjustments to our allowance for credit losses, resulting in material reductions to our revenues and net earnings.\nGlobal economic and capital market conditions may cause our access to capital to be more difficult in the future and/or costs to secure such capital more expensive.\nWe may need new or additional financing in the future to provide liquidity to conduct our operations, expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness. Any sustained weakness in general economic conditions and/or U.S. or global capital markets could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all. From time to time we have relied, and we may also rely in the future, on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Our access to funds under our credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments. Those financial institutions may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. Moreover, the obligations of the financial institutions under our credit facility are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. Longer term volatility and continued disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation of financial institutions, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term. Such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.\nVolatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and required pension contributions.\nWe sponsor qualified defined benefit pension plans and various other nonqualified postretirement plans. The qualified defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities and other investments. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can (i) affect the level of plan funding; (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost; and (iii) increase our future contribution requirements. A significant decrease in investment returns or the market value of plan assets or a significant decrease in interest rates could increase our net periodic pension costs and adversely affect our results of operations. A significant increase in our contribution requirements with respect to our qualified defined benefit pension plans could have an adverse impact on our cash flow.\nTerrorist activities and other acts of violence or war, pandemics, natural disasters and other disruptions have negatively impacted in the past and could negatively impact in the future the United States and foreign countries, the financial markets, the industries in which we compete, our operations and profitability.\nTerrorist activities, pandemics, natural disasters and other disruptions have contributed to economic instability in the United States and elsewhere, and acts of terrorism, cyber-terrorism or violence, war or pandemics or natural disasters could affect the industries in which we compete, our ability to purchase raw materials or make, adequately staff our operations or sell or distribute products, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse weather conditions may reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales.\nFrom time to time, adverse weather conditions or the impacts of climate change and natural disasters have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint, coatings, roofing, construction products and related products. For example, unusually cold or rainy weather, especially during the general construction and exterior painting season, could have an adverse effect on sales of such products. As a result, we have historically experienced weaker sales and net income in our third fiscal quarter (December through February) in comparison to our performance during our other fiscal quarters.\nSignificant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may harm our financial results.\nWe conduct business in various regions throughout the world and are therefore subject to market risk due to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which we transact business could materially adversely affect our net revenues, operating income and the carrying values of our assets located outside the United States. For example, Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. Such strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our operating results.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nThe use of accounting estimates involves judgment and could impact our financial results.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d Additionally, as discussed in Note P, \u201cContingencies and Accrued Losses,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to legal proceedings and various loss reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment, and therefore, actual financial results may differ.\nThe results of our annual testing and as-required interim testing of goodwill and other intangible assets have required, and in the future may require that we record impairment charges.\nAs of May 31, 2021, we had approximately $2.0 billion in goodwill and other intangible assets. The Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) section 350 requires that goodwill be tested at least on an annual basis, or more frequently as impairment indicators arise, using either a qualitative assessment or a fair-value approach at the reporting unit level. We perform our annual required impairment tests, which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the reporting units with which goodwill is associated, as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter. The evaluation of our long-lived assets for impairment includes determining whether indicators of impairment exist, which is a subjective process that considers both internal and external factors. Impairment assessment requires the use of significant judgment regarding estimates and assumptions surrounding future results of operations and cash flows.\nOur required annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which we performed during the fourth quarters of the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 did not result in an impairment charge. For discussion of the approach for, and results of, our interim and annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for all periods presented, please refer to the headings entitled \u201cGoodwill\u201d and \u201cOther Long-Lived Assets\u201d within the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d sections located in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d as well as Note A(11) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements as presented below.\nIn the future, if global economic conditions were to decline significantly, or if our reporting units experience significant declines in business, we may incur additional, substantial goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges. The amount of any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur significant amount of indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur total debt was approximately $2.4 and $2.5 billion at May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which compares with $1.7 billion in stockholders\u2019 equity at May 31, 2021. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, stock repurchases or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nresult in a downgrade of our credit rating, which would increase our borrowing costs, adversely affect our financial results, and make it more difficult for us to raise capital;\n\u2022\nrestrict our operational flexibility and reduce our ability to conduct certain transactions, since our credit facility contains certain restrictive financial and operating covenants;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions, which would make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nhave a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity if large debt maturities occur in close succession.\nWe cannot assure you that our business always will be able to make timely or sufficient payments of our debt. Should we fail to comply with covenants in our debt instruments, such failure could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nOngoing operating improvement initiatives could cause us to incur significant expenses and impact the trading value of our common stock.\nOn May 31, 2021, we formally concluded our MAP to Growth operating improvement program, which resulted in significant changes in our organizational and operational structure impacting most of our companies. While MAP to Growth has formally concluded, we may take additional actions during future periods in furtherance of these objectives. We may incur further expenses as a result of these actions, and we also may experience disruptions in our operations, decreased productivity and unanticipated employee turnover. The occurrence of any of these or other related events associated with our operating improvement initiatives could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nFluctuations in the supply and prices of raw materials may negatively impact our financial results.\nThe cost and availability of raw materials, including packaging, materially impact our financial results. We obtain raw materials from a number of suppliers. Many of our raw materials are petroleum-based derivatives, minerals and metals. The cost of raw materials has in the past experienced, and likely will continue to experience, periods of volatility which could increase the cost of manufacturing our products. Under normal market conditions, raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of sources; however, our suppliers may be impacted by social and environmental regulations and expectations, including regulations related to climate change, adverse weather conditions, pandemics, trade policy, energy availability or civil unrest, resulting in shortages. Interruptions in the supply of raw materials or sources of energy could have a significant impact on our ability or cost to produce products.\nAdequate supply of raw materials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology; however, the unavailability of raw materials or increased prices of raw materials that we are unable to pass along to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, changes in international trade duties and other aspects of international trade policy, both in the United States and abroad, could materially impact the cost of raw materials. Any increase in materials that is not offset by an increase in our prices could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and some of our competitors are much larger than we are and may have greater financial resources than we do.\nThe markets in which we operate are fragmented, and we do not face competition from any one company across all of our product lines. However, any significant increase in competition, as a result of the consolidation of competitors, may cause us to lose market share or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced gross profit margins. Increased competition may also impair our ability to grow or to maintain our current levels of revenues and earnings. Companies that compete in our markets include Akzo Nobel, Axalta Coating Systems Ltd., Carlisle Companies Inc., GCP Applied Technologies, H.B. Fuller, Masco Corporation, PPG Industries, Inc., The Sherwin-Williams Company and Sika AG. Several of these companies are much larger than we are and may have greater financial resources than we do. Increased competition with these or other companies could prevent the institution of price increases or could require price reductions or increased spending to maintain our market share, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management.\nOur success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. While we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time.\nWe depend on a number of large customers for a significant portion of our net sales and, therefore, significant declines in the level of purchases by any of these key customers could harm our business.\nSome of our operating companies, particularly in the Consumer segment, face a substantial amount of customer concentration. Our key Consumer segment customers include Ace Hardware, Amazon, Canadian Tire, Do It Best, The Home Depot, Inc., Lowe\u2019s, Menards, Orgill, True Value, and Wal-Mart. Within our Consumer segment, sales to these customers accounted for approximately 65%, 64% and 66% of net sales for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. On a consolidated basis, sales to these customers across all of our reportable segments accounted for approximately 24%, 23% and 23% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales to The Home Depot, Inc. represented less than 10% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, and 26% of our Consumer segment net sales for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 and 29% of our Consumer segment net sales for fiscal 2019. If we were to lose one or more of our key customers, or experience a delay or cancellation of a significant order, or incur a significant decrease in the level of purchases from any of our key customers, or experience difficulty in collecting amounts due from a key customer, our net revenues could decline materially and our operating results could be reduced materially.\nIf our efforts in acquiring and integrating other companies or product lines or establishing joint ventures fail, our business may not grow.\nAs an important part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue pursuing acquisitions of complementary businesses or products and creating joint ventures. Our ability to continue to grow in this manner depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions or joint venture arrangements. Execution of our acquisition strategy with respect to some companies or product lines could fail or could result in unanticipated costs to us that were not apparent despite our due diligence efforts, either of which could hinder our growth or adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, acquisitions and their subsequent integration involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessments of disclosed liabilities and the potentially adverse effects of undisclosed liabilities;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, their products, and their culture into our existing business;\n\u2022\nunforeseen delays in realizing the benefits from acquired companies or product lines, including projected efficiencies, cost savings, revenue synergies and profit margins;\n\u2022\nunforeseen diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from other business matters;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties resulting from insufficient prior experience in any new markets we may enter;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties in retaining key employees and customers of acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nincreases in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities, which could in turn restrict our ability to raise additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenues from foreign markets, which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur foreign manufacturing operations accounted for approximately 31.9% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, not including exports directly from the United States which accounted for approximately 1.1% of our net sales for fiscal 2021. We plan to continue to grow our international operations and the growth and maintenance of such operations could be adversely affected by Brexit, the Covid pandemic or other public health crises, changes in social, political and economic conditions, inflation rates, trade protection measures, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, changing intellectual property rights, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of our products or increase our costs. Our ability to effectively manage our foreign operations may pose significant risks that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nData privacy and data security considerations could impact our business.\nThe interpretation and application of data protection laws, rules and regulations in the United States, Europe and elsewhere applicable to our business (collectively, the \u201cData Protection Laws\u201d) are uncertain and evolving. It is possible that the Data Protection Laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. Complying with these various laws is difficult and could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Further, although we have implemented internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the Data Protection Laws, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will enable us to be fully compliant with all Data Protection Laws.\nDespite our efforts to protect personal, sensitive and confidential information, comply with the Data Protection Laws and implement data security measures, we may be vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other data loss, and, in fact, we have experienced data security incidents that have impacted our operations, but have not had a material impact on our financial results. These risks may be increased as a result of the Covid pandemic. In addition, it is not possible to predict the impact on our business of the future loss, alteration or misappropriation of information related to us, our employees, former employees, customers, suppliers or others. This could lead to negative publicity, legal claims, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, damage to or inaccessibility of critical systems, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes, operational disruptions, data breach claims and other significant costs, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our material trademarks and other proprietary information or there is a loss in the actual or perceived value of our brands.\nWe have numerous valuable patents, trade secrets and know-how, domain names, trademarks and trade names, including certain marks that are significant to our business, which are identified under Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Despite our efforts to protect our trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure, other parties may attempt to disclose or use them without our authorization; such unauthorized use or disclosure could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nSimilarly, the reputations of our branded products depend on numerous factors, including the successful advertising and marketing of our brand names, consumer acceptance, continued trademark validity, the availability of similar products from our competitors, and our ability to maintain product quality, technological advantages and claims of superior performance. A loss of a brand or in the actual or perceived value of our brands could limit or reduce the demand for our products and could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nAlthough we have insurance, it may not cover every potential risk associated with our operations.\nAlthough we maintain insurance of various types to cover many of the risks and hazards that apply to our operations, our insurance may not cover every potential risk associated with our operations. The occurrence of a significant adverse event, the risks of which are not fully covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates and with terms and conditions we consider reasonable.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nThe coatings, chemical and construction products industries in which we operate expose us to inherent risks of legal and warranty claims and other litigation-related costs, which could adversely impact our business.\nAs a participant in the coatings, chemical and construction products industries, we face an inherent risk of legal claims in the event that the exposure to or failure, use or misuse of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. In the course of our business, we are subject to a variety of inquiries and investigations by regulators, as well as claims and lawsuits by private parties including those related to product liability, product claims regarding asbestos or other chemicals or materials of concern in our products, warranties, the environment, contracts, service contracts, intellectual property and commercial matters, which due to their uncertain nature may result in losses, some of which may be material. We are defending claims and class action lawsuits, and could be subject to future claims and lawsuits, in which significant financial damages are alleged. These matters could consume material financial resources to defend and be a distraction to management. Some, but not all, of such matters are insured. We offer warranties on many of our products, as well as long term warranty programs at certain of our businesses and, as a result, from time to time we may experience higher levels of warranty expense, which is typically reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. The nature and extent to which we use hazardous or flammable materials in our manufacturing processes creates risk of damage to persons and property that, if realized, could be material.\nCompliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could subject us to unforeseen future expenditures or liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous, complicated and often increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those developed in response to climate change, in the jurisdictions where we conduct business and sell our products. Governmental and regulatory authorities impose various laws and regulations on us that relate to environmental protection, the use, sale, transportation, import and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters, including the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of solid and hazardous wastes, the use of certain chemicals in product formulations, and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances and those related to climate change. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, RCRA, CERCLA, TSCA, DSL, REACH and many other federal, state, provincial, local and international statutes. These laws and regulations often impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, not addressing our, or our\npredecessors\u2019 past or present facilities and third-party disposal sites. We are currently undertaking remedial activities at a number of our properties and could be subject to future liability as yet unknown, but that could be material.\nWe have not always been and may not always be in full compliance with all environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in every jurisdiction in which we conduct our business. In addition, if we violate or fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws (including related to permitting), we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators, including enjoining or curtailing operations, remedial or corrective measures, installing pollution control equipment, or other actions. We have been and also could in the future be liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or chemicals of concern relating to our products or operations. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to make additional expenditures to remain in or to achieve compliance with environmental, health or safety laws or changes in stakeholder preferences or expectations in the future or that any such additional expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If regulatory permits or registrations are delayed, restricted, or rejected, subsequent operations at our businesses could be delayed or restricted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur businesses are subject to varying domestic and foreign laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nOur businesses are subject to varying domestic and foreign laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. These include securities, environmental, health, safety, tax, competition and anti-trust, insurance, service contract and warranty, trade controls, data security, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, employment and privacy laws and regulations. These laws and regulations change from time to time and thus may result in increased risk and costs to us related to our compliance therewith. From time to time regulators review our compliance with applicable laws. We have not always been, and may not always be, in full compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to our business and, thus enforcement actions, fines and private litigation claims and damages, which could be material, may occur, notwithstanding our belief that we have in place appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries, as well as trade sanctions administered by the office of Foreign Assets Control and the Department of Commerce.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to governmental officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or for other unfair advantage. Our policies mandate compliance with anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.\nWe are required to comply with U.S. regulations on trade sanctions and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Commerce Department and similar multi-national bodies and governmental agencies worldwide, which are complex and often changing. A violation thereof could subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including a loss of export privileges and significant civil and criminal penalties and fines.\nAlthough we have internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will prevent a violation of these laws. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to the effect of global tax law changes, some of which have been, and may be in the future, retroactive in application.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign tax laws and regulations which govern, among other things, taxes on worldwide income. Any potential tax law changes may, for example, increase applicable tax rates, have retroactive application, or impose stricter compliance requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could reduce our consolidated net earnings.\nIn response to, for instance, an economic crisis or recession, governments may revise tax laws, regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant impact on us, including modifications that could, for example, reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our non-U.S. operations, or that could require costly changes to those operations, or the way in which they are structured. If changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations were to significantly increase the tax rates on non-U.S. income, our effective tax rate could increase, our profits could be reduced, and if such increases were a result of our status as a U.S. company, could place us at a disadvantage to our non-U.S. competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure to comply with federal, state and local government procurement regulations and requirements.\nWe have contracts with and supply product to federal, state and local governmental entities and their contractors, and are required to comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements relating to those contracts and sales. Requirements in our contracts and those requirements flowed down to us in our capacity as a subcontractor or supplier, although customary in government contracts, may impact our performance and compliance costs. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements or to make required disclosures under contract could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination for cause, adverse past performance ratings, actions under a federal or state false claims statutes, suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time and the assessment of penalties and fines, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition and could have a negative impact on our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts in the future.", "PERMNO": 65307, "SIC": 2890, "TIC": "RPM"}
