{"cik": "912766", "company": "LAUREATE EDUCATION, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The risks identified below are not all encompassing but should be considered in establishing an opinion of our future operations. Furthermore, the impact of COVID-19 also may exacerbate the risks identified below, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise of which we are not currently aware. Finally, the risks identified below may affect both our Continuing and Discontinued Operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe operate a portfolio of degree-granting higher education institutions in Mexico and Peru and are subject to complex business, economic, legal, political, tax and foreign currency risks, which risks may be difficult to adequately address.\nOur portfolio, which is composed of five institutions, operates in Mexico and Peru, each of which is subject to complex business, economic, legal, political, tax and foreign currency risks. We may have difficulty managing and administering our operations in multiple countries, and we may need to expend additional funds to, among other things, staff key management positions, obtain additional information technology infrastructure and successfully implement relevant course and program offerings for each market, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional challenges associated with the conduct of our business overseas that may materially adversely affect our operating results include:\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, legal and other differences;\n\u2022our presence solely in Latin America presents risks relating to regional economic pressures;\n\u2022each of our institutions is subject to unique business risks and challenges, including competitive pressures and diverse pricing environments at the local level;\n\u2022difficulty maintaining quality standards consistent with our brands and with local accreditation requirements;\n\u2022potential economic and political instability in the countries in which we operate, including student unrest;\n\u2022fluctuations in exchange rates, possible currency devaluations, inflation and hyperinflation;\n\u2022difficulty selecting, monitoring and controlling partners outside of the United States;\n\u2022compliance with a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022expropriation of assets by governments;\n\u2022political elections and changes in government policies;\n\u2022difficulty protecting our intellectual property rights overseas due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022lower levels of availability or use of the Internet, through which our online programs are delivered;\n\u2022limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions; and\n\u2022acts of terrorism, public health risks, crime and natural disasters, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations.\nOur success in operating our business will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks related to operating in multiple countries. Any failure by us to effectively manage the challenges associated with our operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot maintain student enrollments in our institutions and maintain tuition levels, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur strategy for growth and profitability depends, in part, upon maintaining and, subsequently, increasing student enrollments in our institutions and maintaining tuition levels. Attrition rates are often due to factors outside our control. Students sometimes face financial, personal or family constraints that require them to drop out of school. They also are affected by economic and social factors prevalent in their countries. In some markets in which we operate, transfers between universities are not common and, as a result, we are less likely to fill spaces of students who drop out. In addition, our ability to attract and retain students may require us to discount tuition from published levels and may prevent us from increasing tuition levels at a rate consistent with inflation and increases in our costs. If we are unable to control the rate of student attrition, our overall enrollment levels are likely to decline, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to charge tuition rates that are both competitive and cover our rising expenses, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, student enrollment may be negatively affected by our reputation and any negative publicity related to us.\nOur exploration of strategic alternatives and our activities related to previously announced divestitures may disrupt our ongoing businesses, result in increased expenses and present certain risks to the Company.\nOn January 27, 2020, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the Company to explore strategic alternatives for each of its businesses to unlock shareholder value. During 2020, we completed the sales of our operations in Chile, Malaysia, and Australia & New Zealand and signed definitive agreements to sell Walden University, our higher education institution in the U.S., as well as our operations in Brazil and Honduras. We expect to close the Brazil and Honduras transactions during the first half of the year. The closing for the Walden transaction is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2021.\nFor our institutions in Mexico and Peru, our board of directors decided after a thorough evaluation of all strategic options, including a potential sale, to continue to operate these assets under Laureate management. The decision to focus on a regional operating model in Mexico and Peru at this time does not preclude further engagement with potential buyers for those businesses.\nSpeculation and uncertainty regarding our exploration of strategic alternatives and pending divestitures may cause or result in:\n\u2022disruption of our businesses;\n\u2022distraction of our management and employees;\n\u2022difficulty in recruiting, hiring, motivating and retaining talented and skilled personnel;\n\u2022reduced enrollment or increased competition for enrollment at our universities;\n\u2022increased scrutiny from our regulators;\n\u2022difficulty in maintaining or negotiating and consummating new business or strategic relationships or transactions;\n\u2022increased stock price volatility; and\n\u2022increased costs, including taxes on the proceeds from any divestiture, and advisory fees and other transaction costs.\nIn addition, there are risks associated with our proposed divestiture activities, including that:\n\u2022we may not be able to find buyers for our businesses or complete transactions on favorable terms;\n\u2022we may be required to indemnify buyers against certain liabilities and obligations, resulting in significant post-closing exposure to the Company in respect of liabilities of the divested businesses;\n\u2022we may have challenges in identifying and separating the intellectual property and data to be divested from the intellectual property and data that we wish to retain;\n\u2022although our previous divestitures were generally implemented on tax efficient terms, we may incur significant tax costs in implementing additional divestitures;\n\u2022we may not be able to eliminate or reduce overhead and fixed costs associated with the divested assets or businesses, which will impede our ability to operate the retained businesses on a cost effective and efficient basis;\n\u2022we may be required to record impairment charges if the Company determines that (i) the estimated fair value of any of its remaining businesses is less than its carrying value or (ii) the signing of additional sale agreements requires the Company to perform additional impairment tests; and\n\u2022as we explore these additional divestitures, we may have difficulty effectively forecasting future operating results.\nIf we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks related to our exploration of strategic alternatives and the execution of our pending divestitures, the resulting disruption of our businesses may have a material adverse impact on our revenue, operating results and financial condition.\nAn epidemic, pandemic or other public health emergency, such as the recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe extent to which COVID-19, like any other rapidly spreading contagious illness, may impact our operations will depend upon the evolution of the outbreak, which continues to be highly speculative at this time and cannot be predicted with any level of confidence. The Company cannot predict the duration of the outbreak, the severity of the illness or the scope, breadth or depth of the actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and/or other third parties in response to the outbreak.\nWe believe that the continued spread of COVID-19 and any resulting preventative or protective actions has, and could continue to, adversely impact our operations. While we acted quickly to leverage our existing technologies and learning platforms to serve students outside of the traditional classroom setting,-and all of our students were effectively transitioned to an online learning environment shortly after the declaration of the pandemic-our ability to retain students, enroll new students and maintain tuition levels, as well as the ability of our students to pay tuition and other fees, may be materially adversely affected by, among other things, (i) the health of our students, our faculty and their families; (ii) decreases in our students\u2019 and/or their families\u2019 level of disposable income; (iii) the performance and reliability of our online program infrastructure; (iv) our ability to safely return to campus, when appropriate to do so, (v) the ability of our recruiters to conduct outreach with prospective students during the student recruitment season; and (vi) adverse legislative and regulatory actions. If we are unable to retain students, enroll new students, maintain tuition levels and collect student accounts receivables, we may be required to record impairments and our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, an epidemic, pandemic or other public health emergency could adversely affect, and, in the case of COVID-19, has adversely affected, global economies and financial markets. The depth and duration of the global economic and market turmoil resulting from COVID-19 remain highly uncertain, particularly given the lack of appropriate historical benchmarks. Reduced economic activity, increased unemployment and, in some countries, economic recession, may reduce the demand for our programs among students, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. These adverse economic developments also may result in a reduction in the number of jobs available to our graduates and lower salaries being offered in connection with available employment, which, in turn, may result in declines in our placement and retention rates. As a result, any general economic slowdown or recession that disproportionately impacts the countries in which our institutions operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in severe disruption and volatility in the U.S. financial markets. The trading price of our Class A common stock has declined dramatically since the beginning of March 2020 and may continue to experience volatility and declines.\nOur success depends substantially on the value of the local brands of each of our institutions and the Laureate International Universities network brand, each of which may be materially adversely affected by changes in current and prospective students\u2019 perception of our reputation and the use of social media.\nEach of our institutions has worked hard to establish the value of its individual brand. Brand value may be severely damaged, even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity. There has been a marked\nincrease in use of social media platforms, including weblogs (blogs), social media websites, and other forms of Internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of interested persons. We believe that students and prospective employers value readily available information about our institutions and often act on such information without further investigation or authentication, and without regard to its accuracy. In addition, some of our institutions use the Laureate name in promoting their institutions. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted. Information concerning our company and our institutions may be posted on such platforms and devices at any time. Information posted may be materially adverse to our interests, it may be inaccurate, and it may harm our performance, prospects and business.\nOur reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other for-profit and private institutions.\nIn recent years, there have been a number of regulatory investigations and civil litigation matters targeting post-secondary for-profit education institutions in the United States and private higher education institutions in other countries. These investigations and lawsuits have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings and investigations in the United States and in other countries. Allegations against the post-secondary for-profit and private education sectors may affect general public perceptions of for-profit and private educational institutions, including institutions in the Laureate International Universities network and us, in a negative manner. Adverse media coverage regarding other for-profit or private educational institutions or regarding us directly or indirectly could damage our reputation, reduce student demand for our programs, materially adversely affect our revenues and operating profit or result in increased regulatory scrutiny.\nGrowing our online academic programs could be difficult for us.\nDespite our success in effectively transitioning all of our students to an online learning environment shortly after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, the expansion of our existing online programs and the creation of new online academic programs may not be accepted by students or employers, or by government regulators or accreditation agencies, once we reach an epidemiological end to the pandemic. In addition, our efforts may be materially adversely affected by increased competition in the online education market or because of problems with the performance or reliability of our online program infrastructure.\nOur success depends, in part, on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs in recruiting new students.\nIn order to maintain and increase our revenues and margins, we must continue to develop our admissions programs and attract new students in a cost-effective manner. The level of marketing and advertising and types of strategies used are affected by the specific geographic markets, regulatory compliance requirements and the specific individual nature of each institution and its students. The complexity of these marketing efforts contributes to their cost. If we are unable to advertise and market our institutions and programs successfully, our ability to attract and enroll new students could be materially adversely affected and, consequently, our financial performance could suffer. We use marketing tools such as the Internet, radio, television and print media advertising to promote our institutions and programs. Our representatives also make presentations at upper secondary schools. In order to maintain our growth, we will need to attract a larger percentage of students in existing markets and increase our addressable market by adding locations in new markets and rolling out new academic programs. Any failure to accomplish this may have a material adverse effect on our future growth.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth and business, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or accelerate the current growth rate, effectively manage expanding operations, build expansion capacity, integrate new institutions or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis. If our revenue growth is less than projected, the costs incurred for these additions and upgrades could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur institutions are subject to uncertain and varying laws and regulations, and any changes to these laws or regulations or their application to us may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHigher education is regulated to varying degrees and in different ways in each of the countries in which we operate an institution. In general, our institutions must have licenses, approvals, authorizations, or accreditations from various governmental authorities and accrediting bodies. These licenses, approvals, authorizations, and accreditations must be renewed periodically, usually after an evaluation of the institution by the relevant governmental authorities or accrediting bodies. These periodic evaluations could result in limitations, restrictions, conditions, or withdrawal of such licenses, approvals, authorizations or accreditations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. Once licensed, approved, authorized or accredited, some of our institutions may need approvals for new campuses or to add new degree programs.\nAll of these regulations and their applicable interpretations are subject to change. Moreover, regulatory agencies may scrutinize our institutions because they are owned or controlled by a U.S.-based for-profit corporation. Changes in applicable regulations may cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe higher education market is very competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nHigher education markets around the world are highly fragmented and are very competitive and dynamic. Our institutions compete with traditional public and private colleges and universities and other proprietary institutions, including those that offer online professional-oriented programs. In each of the countries in which we operate a private institution, our primary competitors are public and other private universities, some of which are larger, more widely known and have more established reputations than our institutions. Some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors may have greater financial and other resources than we have and have operated in their markets for many years. We also face potential competition from alternative education providers that prioritize open access education to students. A number of these providers have been formed recently to provide online curriculum from leading academics at little or no cost to the student. If this new modality is successful, it could disrupt the economics of the current education model (both for-profit and not-for-profit institutions). Other competitors may include large, well-capitalized companies that may pursue a strategy similar to ours of acquiring or establishing for-profit institutions. Public institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and public and private not-for-profit institutions have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit institutions. Accordingly, public and private not-for-profit institutions may have instructional and support resources superior to those in the for-profit sector, and public institutions can offer substantially lower tuition prices or other advantages that we cannot match.\nIf our graduates are unable to obtain professional licenses or certifications required for employment in their chosen fields of study, our reputation may suffer and we may face declining enrollments and revenues or be subject to student litigation.\nCertain of our students require or desire professional licenses or certifications after graduation to obtain employment in their chosen fields. Their success in obtaining such licensure depends on several factors, including the individual merits of the student, whether the institution and the program were approved by the relevant government or by a professional association, whether the program from which the student graduated meets all governmental requirements and whether the institution is accredited. If one or more governmental authorities refuses to recognize our graduates for professional licensure in the future based on factors relating to us or our programs, the potential growth of our programs would be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we could be exposed to litigation that would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected if we are not able to maintain or improve the content of our existing academic programs or to develop new programs on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner.\nWe continually seek to maintain and improve the content of our existing academic programs and develop new programs in order to meet changing market needs. Revisions to our existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or employers in all instances. If we cannot respond effectively to market changes, our business may be materially adversely affected. Even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students or employers require or as quickly as our competitors are able to introduce competing programs. Our efforts to introduce a new academic program may be conditioned or delayed by requirements to obtain foreign, federal, state and accrediting agency approvals. The development of new programs and courses, both conventional and online, is subject to requirements and limitations imposed by the governmental regulatory bodies of the various countries in which our institutions are located. The imposition of restrictions on the initiation of new educational programs by regulatory agencies may delay such expansion plans. If we do not respond adequately to changes in market requirements, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying existing academic programs also may require us to make investments in specialized personnel and capital expenditures, increase marketing efforts and reallocate resources away from other uses. We may have limited experience with the subject matter of new programs and may need to modify our systems and strategy. If we are unable to increase the number of students, offer new programs in a cost-effective manner or otherwise effectively manage the operations of newly established academic programs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to keep pace with changing market needs and technology could harm our ability to attract students.\nThe success of our institutions depends to a significant extent on the willingness of prospective employers to hire our students upon graduation. Increasingly, employers demand that their employees possess appropriate technological skills and also appropriate \u201csoft\u201d skills, such as communication, critical thinking and teamwork skills. These skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important that our educational programs evolve in response to those economic and technological changes. The expansion of existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by current or prospective students or by the employers of our graduates. Students and faculty increasingly rely on personal communication devices and expect that we will be able to adapt our information technology platforms and our educational delivery methods to support these devices and any new technologies that may develop. Even if our institutions are able to develop acceptable new programs and adapt to new technologies, our institutions may not be able to begin offering those new programs and technologies as quickly as required by prospective students and employers or as quickly as our competitors begin offering similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired, the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could suffer and our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may have exposure to greater-than-anticipated tax liabilities.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.\nOur future income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions in which we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions in which we have higher statutory tax rates. In addition, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles, could have a material adverse effect on our future income taxes.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We have not recorded any deferred tax liabilities for undistributed foreign earnings either because of legal restrictions on distributions or because our historical strategy was to reinvest these earnings outside the United States. As circumstances change and if some or all of these undistributed foreign earnings are remitted to the United States, we may be required to recognize deferred tax liabilities on those amounts.\nAdditionally, in certain countries in which we operate, higher education institutions are either exempt from paying certain taxes, including income taxes, or pay taxes at significantly reduced rates. If we were to lose this favorable tax treatment because of a change in local tax laws, our tax liabilities could increase materially.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are under regular audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities.\nWe have identified certain contingencies, primarily tax-related, that we have assessed as being reasonably possible of loss, but not probable of loss, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if the outcomes are unfavorable. In most cases, we have received indemnifications from the former owners and/or noncontrolling interest holders of the acquired businesses for contingencies. In cases where we are not indemnified, the unrecorded contingencies are primarily in Brazil and, in the aggregate, we estimate that the reasonably possible loss for these unrecorded contingencies in Brazil could be up to approximately $49 million if the outcomes were unfavorable in all cases. If we are not able to recover amounts that are subject to indemnification, the loss for these contingencies could be greater.\nFor information related to outstanding tax audits initiated by the Spanish Taxing Authorities, see \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nAlthough we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially adversely affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOur reported revenues and earnings may be negatively affected by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and currency exchange rates.\nWe report revenues, costs and earnings in U.S. dollars, while our institutions generally collect tuition in the local currency. Exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the local currency in the countries where we operate institutions are likely to fluctuate from period to period. In 2020, essentially all of our revenues originated outside the United States. We translate revenues and other results denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements. This translation is based on average exchange rates during a reporting period. In recent years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many international currencies, including the Mexican peso. As the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar strengthens, our reported international revenues and earnings are reduced because foreign currencies translate into fewer U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 10% adverse change in average annual foreign currency exchange rates, excluding the impacts of our derivatives, would have decreased our operating income and our Adjusted EBITDA by $8.6 million and $31.8 million, respectively. For more information, see \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exchange Risk.\u201d\nTo the extent that foreign revenues and expense transactions are not denominated in the local currency and/or to the extent foreign earnings are reinvested in a currency other than their functional currency, we are also subject to the risk of transaction losses. We occasionally enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other hedging arrangements to reduce the earnings impact of non-functional currency denominated non-trade receivables and debt and to protect the U.S. dollar value of our assets and future cash flows with respect to exchange rate fluctuations. Given the volatility of exchange rates, there is no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage currency transaction and/or translation risks. Therefore, volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rates and our reported revenues and earnings may also be negatively affected by inflation or hyperinflation. If a country in which we operate is designated as a highly inflationary economy in the future under GAAP, the U.S. dollar would become the functional currency for our operations in that country. As a result, all gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the financial results of operations in such country and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses would be reflected in our earnings, which could result in volatility within our earnings, rather than as a component of our comprehensive income within stockholders\u2019 equity. Hyperinflation in any of the countries in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles make up a significant portion of our total assets, and if we determine that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles become impaired in the future, net income and operating income in such years may be materially and adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $800.4 million. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Due to the revaluation of our assets at the time of the LBO and acquisitions we have completed historically, goodwill makes up a significant portion of our total assets. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations. Future reviews of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could result in reductions. Any reduction in net income and operating income resulting from the write down or impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could adversely affect our financial results. If economic or industry conditions deteriorate or if market valuations decline, including with respect to our Class A common stock, we may be required to impair goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in future periods.\nWe experience seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.\nThe institutions in our portfolio have a summer break, during which classes are generally not in session and minimal revenues are recognized. In addition to the timing of summer breaks, holidays such as Easter also have an impact on our academic calendar. Operating expenses, however, do not fully correlate to the enrollment and revenue cycles, as the institutions continue to incur expenses during summer breaks. Accordingly, our second and fourth quarters are stronger revenue quarters, as our institutions are in session for most of these respective quarters. Our first and third fiscal quarters are weaker revenue quarters because our institutions have summer breaks for some portion of one of these two quarters. Because a significant portion of our expenses do not vary proportionately with the fluctuations in our revenues, our results in a particular fiscal quarter may not indicate accurately the results we will achieve in a subsequent quarter or for the full fiscal year.\nConnectivity constraints or technology system disruptions to our computer networks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students.\nWe run the online operations of our institutions on different platforms, which are in various stages of development. The performance and reliability of these online operations are critical to the reputation of our institutions and our ability to attract and retain students. Any computer system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our institutions\u2019 computer networks may result in the unavailability of these computer networks. In addition, any significant failure of our computer networks could disrupt our on-campus operations. Individual, sustained or repeated occurrences could significantly damage the reputation of our institutions\u2019 operations and result in a loss of potential or existing students. Additionally, the computer systems and operations of our institutions are vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters and other catastrophic events and network and telecommunications failures. The disaster recovery plans and backup systems that we have in place may not be effective in addressing a natural disaster or catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology and infrastructure systems. As a result of any of these events, we may not be able to conduct normal business operations and may be required to incur significant expenses in order to resume normal business operations. As a result, our revenues and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to privacy and information security laws and regulations due to our collection and use of personal information, and any violations of those laws or regulations, or any breach, theft or loss of that information, could materially adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. Our institutions collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data and credit card numbers. We also collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. In addition, we collect and maintain other types of information, such as leads, that may include personal information of our business contacts in the ordinary course of our business. Our computer networks and the networks of certain of our vendors that hold and manage confidential information on our behalf may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, cyber-attacks and other security threats. Confidential information also may become available to third parties inadvertently when we integrate or convert computer networks into our network following an acquisition of an institution or in connection with upgrades from time to time.\nDue to the sensitive nature of the information contained on our networks, such as students\u2019 grades, our networks may be targeted by hackers. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches.\nFurthermore, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. For example, the European Union\u2019s privacy and data security regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018, imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of total company revenue). Countries in other regions, including Mexico and Peru, have passed or are considering similar privacy regulations, resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources to comply with the GDPR and other privacy laws and regulations.\nA breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families, our employees, or other persons that is held by us or our vendors, or a violation of the laws and regulations governing privacy in one or more of the countries in which we operate, could result in significant penalties or legal liability, reputational damage, and/or remediation and compliance costs, which could be substantial and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStudent protests and strikes may disrupt our ability to hold classes as well as our ability to attract and retain students, which could materially adversely affect our operations.\nPolitical, social and economic developments in the countries in which we operate may cause protests and disturbances against conditions in those countries, including policies relating to the operation and funding of higher education institutions. These\ndisturbances may involve protests on university campuses, including the occupation of university buildings and the disruption of classes. We are unable to predict whether students at institutions in the Laureate International Universities network will engage in various forms of protest in the future. Should we sustain student strikes, protests or occupations in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and on our overall financial condition. Further, we may need to make additional investments in security infrastructure and personnel on our campuses in order to prevent future student protests from disrupting the ability of our institutions to hold classes. If we are required to make substantial additional investments in security, or if we are unable to identify security enhancements that would prevent future disruptions of classes, that could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may need to pay overtime compensation to certain of our faculty and staff, which may increase our overall costs.\nWe may be unable to operate one or more of our institutions or suffer liability or loss due to a natural or other disaster.\nOur institutions are vulnerable to natural or other disasters, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and other events beyond our control. A number of our institutions in Mexico and Peru are located in areas that are prone to damage from major weather events, which may be substantial. For example, in 2017, Peru\u2019s normally arid regions experienced historic, torrential rainfall and subsequent flooding. At least one of our campuses located there suffered flood-related damage. There, as elsewhere in the country, flood-related damage caused a range of disruptions, including in our case a delay in the regularly scheduled start of classes for the semester, which caused revenue disruptions. In addition, a number of our institutions in Mexico and Peru are located in areas that are prone to earthquake damage. For example, in 2017, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico, causing a temporary suspension of activities at several UVM and UNITEC campuses located in the affected states of Mexico City, Puebla, Veracruz, Morelos, Chiapas and Estado de M\u00e9xico. UVM and UNITEC temporarily suspended all activities on 21 campuses at the request of the Ministry of Education. The temporary suspension lasted 12 days on average and we incurred significant direct costs for repairs due to the earthquake. It is possible that one or more of our institutions would be unable to operate for an extended period of time in the event of a hurricane, earthquake or other disaster that causes substantial damage to the area in which an institution is located. The failure of one or more of our institutions to operate for a substantial period of time could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the event of a major natural or other disaster, we could also experience loss of life of students, faculty members and administrative staff, or liability for damages or injuries.\nWe may be unable to recruit, train and retain qualified and experienced faculty and administrative staff at our institutions.\nOur success and ability to grow depend on the ability to hire and retain large numbers of talented people. The process of hiring employees with the combination of skills and attributes required to implement our business strategy can be difficult and time-consuming. Our faculty members in particular are key to the success of our institutions. We face competition in attracting and retaining faculty members who possess the necessary experience and accreditation to teach at our institutions. It may be difficult to maintain consistency in the quality of our faculty and administrative staff. If we are unable to, or are perceived to be unable to, attract and retain experienced and qualified faculty, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to upgrade our campuses, they may become less attractive to parents and students and we may fail to grow our business.\nAll of our institutions require periodic upgrades to remain attractive to parents and students. Upgrading the facilities at our institutions could be difficult for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022our properties may not have the capacity or configuration to accommodate proposed renovations;\n\u2022construction and other costs may be prohibitive;\n\u2022we may fail to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u2022it may be difficult and expensive to comply with local building and fire codes, especially as to properties that we acquired as part of past acquisitions;\n\u2022we may be unable to finance construction and other costs; and\n\u2022we may not be able to negotiate reasonable terms with our landlords or developers or complete the work within acceptable timeframes.\nOur failure to upgrade the facilities of our institutions could lead to lower enrollment and could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to attract and retain the key talent needed for us to timely achieve our business objectives, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe marketplace for senior executive management candidates is very competitive. As we continue to implement changes to our corporate structure, we may experience higher unplanned turnover than in prior periods. Unplanned or repeated turnover within the senior management ranks in the corporate headquarters or in the regions in which we operate can lead to instability or weakness in oversight that creates the conditions for gaps in performance and non-compliance with our control environment or public company reporting requirements. Any one of these occurrences could adversely affect our stock price, results of operations, ability to timely report financial results, or business relationships and can make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. Competition for senior leadership may increase our overall compensation expenses, whether resulting from new hires or retention, which may negatively affect our profitability.\nLitigation may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, students, suppliers, competitors, minority partners, counterparties in transactions in which we purchase or sell assets, stockholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation, some of which may take place in jurisdictions in which local parties may have certain advantages over foreign parties. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property claims, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, or may assert criminal charges, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), as well as trade compliance and economic sanctions laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of numerous jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations and business practices. In particular, we are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage, along with various other anti-corruption laws. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. We cannot assure you that all of our local partners will comply with these laws, in which case we could be held liable for actions taken inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Any development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide would increase the risk of FCPA violations in the future.\nViolations of anti-corruption laws, export control laws and regulations, and economic sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. If we fail to comply with the FCPA or other laws governing the conduct of international operations, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, export control laws and regulations, and economic sanctions laws and regulations by the United States or foreign authorities could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, regardless of the outcome of the investigation.\nWe have in the past had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn 2018, we remediated each of the four material weaknesses that were previously identified and were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. See \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures-Remediation of Material Weaknesses\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nHowever, we may in the future discover areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, regardless of how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we or our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide us with an unqualified opinion as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If that were to happen, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our Class A common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nAdditionally, the existence of any material weakness could require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weakness and management may not be able to remediate any such material weakness in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting also could result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause the holders of our Class A common stock to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and share price.\nRisks Relating to Walden University, which is included in our Discontinued Operations, and the Highly Regulated Higher Education Industry in the United States\nFailure of Walden University to comply with extensive regulatory requirements could result in significant monetary liabilities, fines and penalties, restrictions on our operations, limitations on our growth, or loss of access to federal student loans and grants for our students, on which we are substantially dependent.\nWalden University, our postsecondary educational institution in the United States, is subject to extensive regulatory requirements, including at the federal, state, and accrediting agency levels. Many students at Walden University rely on the availability of federal student financial aid programs, known as Title IV programs, which are administered by the DOE, to finance their cost of attending our institution. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, Walden University derived approximately 76% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, Walden University must be authorized by the appropriate state education agency or agencies, accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE, and certified as an eligible institution by the DOE. As a result, Walden University is subject to extensive regulation and review by these agencies and commissions, including our educational programs, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, student recruiting and admissions, and financial operations. These regulations also affect our ability to acquire or open additional institutions, add new educational programs, substantially change existing programs or change our corporate or ownership structure. The agencies and commissions that regulate our operations periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements. Regulatory requirements are not always precise and clear, and regulatory agencies may sometimes disagree with the way we interpret or apply these requirements. If we misinterpret or are found to have not complied with any of these regulatory requirements, Walden University could suffer financial penalties, limitations on its operations, loss of accreditation, termination of or limitations on its ability to grant degrees and certificates, or limitations on or termination of its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are charged with regulatory violations, our reputation could be damaged, which could have a negative impact on our enrollments and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict with certainty how all of these regulatory requirements will be applied, or whether we will be able to comply with all of the applicable requirements in the future.\nIf Walden University were to lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, we would experience a material and adverse decline in revenues, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects. Furthermore, Walden University would be unable to continue its business as it is currently conducted, which could have a material adverse effect on the institution\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf any of the U.S. education regulatory agencies or commissions that regulate us do not approve or delay any required approvals of transactions involving a change of control, our ability to operate or participate in Title IV programs may be impaired.\nIf we or Walden University experiences a change of ownership or control under the standards of the DOE, any applicable accrediting agency, any applicable state educational licensing agency or any specialized accrediting agency, we must notify or seek approval of each such agency or commission. These agencies do not have uniform criteria for what constitutes a change of ownership or control. Transactions or events that typically constitute a change of ownership or control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of shares of the voting stock of an institution or its parent company, and significant changes in the composition of the board of directors of an institution or its parent company. The occurrence of some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from the DOE or any applicable accrediting agency or state educational licensing agency could impair Walden University\u2019s ability to operate or participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from any state in which Walden University is currently licensed or authorized, or from any applicable accrediting agency, could require us to suspend our activities in that state or suspend offering applicable programs until we receive the required approval, or could otherwise impair our operations.\nIn connection with the contemplated acquisition of Walden University by Adtalem Global Education Inc. (\u201cAdtalem\u201d), Walden has filed a pre-acquisition review application with the DOE and also has filed an application for approval of the change of ownership with its primary accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission, as well as with various state educational agencies and programmatic accrediting agencies that require that such changes be approved prior to their occurrence.\nOur failure to obtain any required approval of any transactions from the DOE, the institutional accrediting agencies or the pertinent state educational agencies, including in connection with the contemplated acquisition of Walden University by Adtalem, could result in Walden University losing continued eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, accreditation or state licensure, which could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCongress may revise the laws governing Title IV programs or reduce funding for those and other student financial assistance programs, and the DOE may revise its regulations administering Title IV programs, any of which could reduce our enrollment and revenues and increase costs of operations.\nThe U.S. Higher Education Act (the \u201cHEA\u201d) is a federal law that governs Title IV programs. The U.S. Congress must authorize and appropriate funding for Title IV programs under the HEA and can change the laws governing Title IV programs at any time. Congress reauthorizes the HEA, which governs federal financial assistance for higher education, generally every five to ten years. The HEA was most recently reauthorized in August 2008; however, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for federal fiscal year 2021 included a number of significant changes to federal student aid policy, including changes to the needs analysis applicable to certain Title IV programs, expanded eligibility for Pell Grants and a repeal of the limitation on lifetime subsidized loan eligibility for undergraduate students. It is likely that there will be bills introduced in the current 117th Congress to reauthorize and further amend the HEA. We cannot predict the timing and terms of any eventual HEA reauthorization, including any potential changes to institutional participation, student eligibility requirements or funding levels for particular Title IV programs, which terms may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Apart from Title IV programs, eligible veterans and military personnel may receive educational benefits for the pursuit of higher education.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the future funding levels for Title IV programs, or for programs providing educational benefits to veterans and military personnel, or the nature of any future revisions to the law or regulations related to these programs. Because a significant percentage of the revenues of Walden University is and is expected to be derived from Title IV programs, any action by the U.S. Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the ability of our U.S. students to participate in Title IV programs could have a material adverse effect on Walden University\u2019s enrollments, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, the DOE has proposed or promulgated a substantial number of new regulations that impact Walden University, including, but not limited to, borrower defenses to repayment, state authorization, and financial responsibility. For additional\ninformation regarding these regulations, see: \u201c-The DOE has adopted regulations governing federal student loan debt forgiveness that could result in liability for amounts based on borrower defenses or affect the DOE\u2019s assessment of our institutional capability\u201d; \u201c-If Walden University fails to obtain or maintain any of its state authorizations in states in which such authorization is required or fail to comply with the laws and regulations of such states, it may not be able to operate or enroll students in that state, and may not be able to award Title IV program funds to students\u201d; and \u201c-If Walden University does not meet specific financial responsibility standards established by the DOE, it may be required to post a letter of credit or accept other limitations to continue participating in Title IV programs, or it could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs\u201d. Any of these new or proposed regulations could have a material adverse effect on Walden University\u2019s enrollments, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn November 1, 2019, the DOE published final regulations regarding state authorization for programs offered through distance education and accreditation requirements, and those regulations became effective on July 1, 2020. For additional information regarding these regulations, see: \u201c-If any Walden University fails to obtain or maintain any of its state authorizations in states in which such authorization is required or fail to comply with the laws and regulations of such states, it may not be able to operate or enroll students in that state, and may not be able to award Title IV program funds to students.\u201d As part of a 2019 negotiating rulemaking, the DOE considered changes to current regulations pertaining to the definition of distance education and to the disbursement of Title IV funds for competency-based education programs resulting in the issuance of a final rule in August 2020 and final rules on the topic that will become effective on July 1, 2021. We cannot predict with certainty when these or other DOE regulations would be finalized or effective or the impact that such new regulations could have on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nThe DOE has adopted regulations governing federal student loan debt forgiveness that could result in liability for amounts based on borrower defenses or affect the DOE\u2019s assessment of our institutional capability.\nOn November 1, 2016, the DOE published a rule that, among other provisions, established new standards and processes for determining whether a William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (\u201cDirect Loan Program\u201d) borrower has a defense to repayment (\u201cDTR\u201d) on a loan due to acts or omissions by the institution at which the loan was used by the borrower for educational expenses (the \u201c2016 DTR regulations\u201d).\nAmong other topics, the 2016 DTR regulations established permissible borrower defense claims for discharge, procedural rules under which claims would be adjudicated, time limits for borrowers\u2019 claims, and guidelines for recoupment by the DOE of discharged loan amounts from institutions of higher education. These aspects of the 2016 DTR regulations are applicable to loans disbursed under the Direct Loan Program on or after July 1, 2017 and before July 1, 2020.\nOn September 23, 2019, the DOE published final regulations revising the 2016 DTR regulations and addressing certain financial responsibility and other matters (the \u201c2019 DTR regulations\u201d). The 2019 DTR regulations became effective on July 1, 2020. Among other things, the 2019 DTR Regulations modify the process and standards by which borrowers can assert a defense to the borrowers\u2019 obligation to repay certain Title IV loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2020. A borrower may assert a defense to repayment if he or she can establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the participating institution misrepresented a material fact on which the borrower reasonably relied when deciding to undertake the loan, so long as the misrepresentation \u201cclearly and directly\u201d relates to initial or continued enrollment at the institution, concerns the institution\u2019s provision of educational services, and also results in financial harm to the borrower. The 2019 DTR regulations establish revised definitions for misrepresentation and financial harm and generally require a borrower to assert his or her defense to repayment within three (3) years from the date on which the student ceased to be enrolled at the institution. The 2019 DTR regulations also give the DOE five (5) years in which to seek recovery of the discharged amount from the institution, after a final written decision that a borrower is entitled to a defense to repayment. The 2019 DTR regulations also modify the \u201ctriggers\u201d that the DOE considers early warning signs of financial difficulty, the occurrence of which may require an institution to provide the DOE with a letter of credit or other surety. The 2019 DTR regulations also include provisions regarding the treatment of operating leases in the financial responsibility composite score methodology, more specifically define and require disclosures concerning the composite score\u2019s inclusion of debt obtained for long-term purposes, and revise limited aspects of the composite score formula to account for changes in accounting terminology. The 2019 DTR regulations took effect on July 1, 2020, except for certain financial responsibility provisions that the DOE has designated for early implementation if an institution wishes to do so.\nWe cannot state with any certainty the impact that complying with the 2016 DTR regulations and the 2019 DTR regulations might have on our business. If we are required to repay the DOE for any successful DTR claims by students who attended Walden University, or if we are required to obtain additional letters of credit or increase our current letter of credit, it could materially affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nWalden University must periodically seek recertification to participate in Title IV programs and, if the DOE does not recertify the institution to continue participating in Title IV programs, our students would lose their access to Title IV program funds, or the institution could be recertified but required to accept significant limitations as a condition of continued participation in Title IV programs.\nDOE certification to participate in Title IV programs lasts a maximum of six years, and institutions are required to seek recertification from the DOE on a regular basis to continue their participation in Title IV programs. An institution must also apply for recertification by the DOE if it undergoes a change in control, as defined by DOE regulations, and may be subject to similar review if it expands its operations or educational programs in certain ways. Generally, the recertification process includes a review by the DOE of the institution\u2019s educational programs and locations, administrative capability, financial responsibility and other oversight categories. The DOE could limit, suspend or terminate an institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs for violations of the HEA or Title IV regulations. As discussed in more detail under \u201cItem 1 - Business-Industry Regulation-Discontinued Operations-U.S. Regulation,\u201d Walden University currently participates in the Title IV programs pursuant to the DOE\u2019s provisional form of certification on a month-to-month basis.\nIf the DOE does not renew or withdraws Walden University\u2019s certifications to participate in Title IV programs at any time, students would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds. Similarly, the DOE could renew Walden University\u2019s certifications, but restrict or delay Title IV funding, limit the number of students to whom it could disburse such funds or impose other restrictions. In addition, the DOE may take emergency action to suspend Walden University\u2019s certifications without advance notice if it receives reliable information that the institution is violating Title IV requirements and it determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse of Title IV funds. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on Walden University\u2019s enrollments and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWalden University would lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs if it fails to maintain its institutional accreditation, and our student enrollments could decline if we fail to maintain any of our accreditations or approvals.\nAn institution must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE to participate in Title IV programs. Walden University is so accredited, and such accreditation is subject to renewal or review periodically or when necessary. If Walden University fails to satisfy any of its accrediting commission\u2019s standards, it could lose its accreditation by its respective accrediting commission, which would cause it to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and experience a significant decline in total student enrollments. In addition, Walden University\u2019s individual educational programs are accredited by specialized accrediting commissions or approved by specialized state agencies. If Walden University fails to satisfy the standards of any of those specialized accrediting commissions or state agencies, it could lose the specialized accreditation or approval for the affected programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if one of Walden University\u2019s accrediting bodies loses recognition by the DOE, the institution could lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nIf Walden University fails to obtain or maintain any of its state authorizations in states in which such authorization is required or fails to comply with the laws and regulations of such states, it may not be able to operate or enroll students in that state, and may not be able to award Title IV program funds to students.\nThe DOE requires that an educational institution be authorized in each state in which it physically operates in order to participate in Title IV programs. The level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state. Walden University is authorized by the Minnesota Office of Higher Education, the applicable state educational licensing agency of its home state, to operate and to grant degrees or diplomas, which authorizations are required for students at the institution to be eligible to receive funding under Title IV programs. If Walden University fails to continuously satisfy applicable standards for maintaining its state authorization in a state in which it is physically located, it could lose its authorization from the applicable state educational agency to offer educational programs and could be forced to cease operations in that state. Such a loss of authorization would also cause its location in the state to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations by the states in which we are authorized or licensed to operate. State laws typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and other operational matters. State laws and regulations are subject to change and may limit our ability to offer educational programs and to award degrees and may limit the ability of our students to sit for certification exams in their chosen fields of study. In addition, as mentioned above, attorneys general in several states have become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws. In addition, we may be subject to litigation by private parties alleging that we violated state laws regarding the educational programs we provide and their operations.\nMany states also have sought to assert jurisdiction, whether through adoption of new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, over out-of-state educational institutions offering online degree programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state, but that have some activity in the state, such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state, employing faculty who reside in the state or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state. State regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent between states and not well developed in many jurisdictions. As such, these requirements change frequently and, in some instances, are not clear or are left to the discretion of state employees or agents. State regulatory agencies may sometimes disagree with the way we have interpreted or applied these requirements. Any misinterpretation by us of these regulatory requirements or adverse changes in regulations or interpretations of these regulations by state licensing agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur online educational programs offered by Walden University and the constantly changing regulatory environment require us to continually evaluate our state regulatory compliance activities. We review the licensure or authorization requirements of other states to determine whether our activities in those states constitute a presence or otherwise require licensure or authorization by the respective state education agencies.\nIn recent years, regional state compacts have created the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (\u201cNC-SARA\u201d), which is a voluntary agreement among member states and U.S. territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance-education courses and programs. As of the date of this filing, all states except California participate in NC-SARA. NC-SARA requires each participating institution to have a federal composite score as measured by the DOE at the parent level of a 1.5 (or a 1.0 with justification acceptable to the state). Walden University does not participate in NC-SARA because the most recent federal composite score for Laureate as measured by the DOE is below 1.0. Accordingly, Walden University must apply for and comply with each state\u2019s applicable authorization requirements related to its distance education activities. Many states have established or are proposing legislation or regulations to create new or different criteria for authorization of \u201cnon-SARA\u201d institutions, including requiring them to post bonds and/or meet composite score requirements. If Walden University does not meet these requirements, it may not enroll students in that state, which could have a material impact on our business.\nAdditionally, the DOE recently revised its state authorization requirements pertaining to distance education. On November 1, 2019, the DOE published final regulations revising its requirements relating to state authorization for programs offered through distance education. These regulations became effective on July 1, 2020. Among other provisions, these final regulations require that an institution participating in the Title IV federal student aid programs and offering post-secondary education through distance education be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state. The final regulations also eliminated or revised certain disclosure requirements applicable to institutions participating in the Title IV federal student aid programs. The DOE stated that it would accept, although it does not require, authorization through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement; provided that the agreement does not prevent a state from enforcing its own general-purpose laws or regulations outside of the state authorization of distance education.\nAny failure to comply with state requirements for our campuses or our distance education programs, or any new or modified regulations at the federal or state level, could result in our inability to enroll students or receive Title IV funds for students in those states and could result in restrictions on our growth and enrollments. If Walden University fails to comply with state licensure or authorization requirements, we could be subject to various sanctions, including restrictions on recruiting students, providing educational programs and other activities in that state, and fines and penalties. Additionally, new laws, regulations or interpretations related to providing online educational programs and services could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could, in turn, negatively affect enrollments and revenues and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability of our graduates to obtain licensure or other specialized outcomes in their chosen professional fields of study could reduce our enrollments and revenues, and potentially lead to litigation that could be costly to us.\nCertain of our graduates seek professional licensure or other specialized outcomes in their chosen fields following graduation. Their success in obtaining these outcomes depends on several factors, including the individual merits of the learner, but also may depend on whether the institution or its programs were approved by the state or by a professional association, whether the program from which the learner graduated meets all state requirements and whether the institution is accredited. In addition, professional associations may refuse to certify specialized outcomes for our learners. The state requirements for licensure are subject to change, as are the professional certification standards, and we may not immediately become aware of changes that may impact our learners in certain instances. In the event that one or more states refuses to recognize our learners for professional licensure, and/or professional associations refuse to certify specialized outcomes for our learners, based on factors relating to our institution or programs, the potential growth of our programs would be negatively affected, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be exposed to litigation that would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased regulatory and enforcement effort of consumer protection laws could be a catalyst for legislative or regulatory restrictions, investigations, enforcement actions and claims that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn recent years, the proprietary education industry has experienced broad-based, intensifying scrutiny in the form of increased investigations and enforcement actions. Attorneys general and educational authorizing agencies in several states, as well as the FTC and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have become more active in enforcing consumer protection laws, especially related to recruiting practices and the financing of education at proprietary educational institutions.\nIn addition, the DOE has specific rules prohibiting substantial misrepresentations to students, members of the public, accrediting agencies and state licensing agencies, as well as the DOE. In the event that the DOE determines that an institution engaged in a substantial misrepresentation, it can revoke the institution\u2019s program participation agreement, impose limitations on the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs, deny participation applications on behalf of the institution, or seek to fine, suspend or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs. These regulations provide grounds for private litigants to seek to enforce the expanded regulations through False Claims Act litigation. On September 14, 2020, Walden University received a letter from the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (referred to herein as \u201cDOJ\u201d) indicating that the DOJ is examining whether Walden University, in the operation of its Masters of Science in Nursing program (referred to herein as the \u201cNursing Program\u201d), may have violated the Federal False Claims Act by misrepresenting compliance with its program participation agreement with the DOE, which agreement covers Walden University\u2019s participation in federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the U.S. Higher Education Act. The letter invites Walden University to provide information regarding a number of specific areas primarily related to the practicum component of its Nursing Program, but it makes no allegations of any misconduct or wrongdoing by Walden University. Further, on November 9, 2020, Walden University received notice from the Higher Learning Commission (\u201cHLC\u201d) that a public \u201cGovernmental Investigation\u201d designation would be assigned to Walden University due to the DOJ inquiry and such designation became effective on November 9, 2020. On November 24, 2020, representatives of Walden University met with individuals from the DOJ to present the information requested. While Laureate is cooperating with the DOJ\u2019s request to voluntarily provide information, it cannot predict the timing or outcome of this matter. At this time, Laureate does not believe that this matter will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Further, consistent with the HLC\u2019s policies and procedures, a Governmental Investigation designation by the HLC could delay or prevent the HLC\u2019s approval of a substantive change application to approve the pending sale of Walden University. We continue to evaluate these regulatory developments and the potential impact, if any, on the pending sale of Walden University.\nIn the event that any of our past or current business practices are found to violate applicable consumer protection laws, or if we are found to have made misrepresentations to our current or prospective students about our educational programs, we could be subject to monetary fines or penalties and possible limitations on the manner in which we conduct our business, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that more states or government agencies commence investigations, act in concert, or direct their focus on Walden University, the cost of responding to these inquiries and investigations could increase significantly, and the potential impact on our business would be substantially greater.\nIf Walden University does not comply with the DOE\u2019s \u201cadministrative capability\u201d standards, we could suffer financial penalties, be required to accept other limitations to continue participating in Title IV programs or lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nDOE regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite \u201cadministrative capability\u201d to participate in Title IV programs. These criteria require, among other things, that we comply with all applicable Title IV program regulations; have capable and sufficient personnel to administer the federal student financial aid programs; not have student loan cohort default rates in excess of specified levels; have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of our students; have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds; not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension; provide financial aid counseling to our students; refer to the DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee or agent of the institution has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs; submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by Title IV regulations; and not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability. If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or comply with any other DOE regulations, the DOE may change the institution\u2019s method of receiving Title IV program\nfunds, which in some cases may result in a significant delay in the institution\u2019s receipt of those funds; place the institution on provisional certification status; or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV programs. Thus, if Walden University were found not to have satisfied the DOE\u2019s \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements, we could be limited in our access to, or lose, Title IV program funding, which could significantly reduce our enrollments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could also be subject to fines or penalties related to findings cited in our regulatory compliance reviews. For more information, see \u201c-Government, regulatory agencies, accrediting bodies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims or initiate litigation against us.\u201d\nIf Walden University does not meet specific financial responsibility standards established by the DOE, it may be required to post a letter of credit or accept other limitations to continue participating in Title IV programs, or it could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, Walden University must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the DOE, or post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. These financial responsibility tests are applied on an annual basis based on an institution\u2019s audited financial statements, and may be applied at other times, such as if an institution undergoes a change in control. The DOE may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to an eligible institution\u2019s operating company and ownership entities and, if such measures are not satisfied by the operating company or ownership entities, require the institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. The operating restrictions that may be placed on an institution that does not meet the quantitative standards of financial responsibility include changes to the method of receiving Title IV program funds, which in some cases may result in a significant delay in the institution\u2019s receipt of those funds. Limitations on, or termination of, our participation in Title IV programs as a result of our failure to demonstrate financial responsibility would limit our students\u2019 access to Title IV program funds, which could significantly reduce enrollments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs described in more detail under \u201cItem 1 - Business-Industry Regulation-Discontinued Operations-U.S. Regulation\u201d in this Form 10-K, the DOE annually assesses Walden University\u2019s financial responsibility through a composite score determination based on the Laureate consolidated audited financial statements and not at the individual institutional level. Based on Laureate\u2019s composite score for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, the DOE determined that it and, consequently, Walden University, failed to meet the standards of financial responsibility. As a result, in a letter sent to Laureate on September 11, 2020, the Department required Laureate to decrease its existing letter of credit to $83.6 million (10% of the Title IV program funds that Walden University and the other institutions that Laureate owned in the U.S. at that time received during the most recently completed fiscal year), continued the institutions on Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 and required Laureate to continue to comply with additional notification and reporting requirements, including submitting bi-weekly cash flow statements for Laureate and monthly student rosters of the institutions, which has been a requirement since April 2018.\nOn November 1, 2019, as part of the 2019 DTR regulations, the DOE updated its general standards of financial responsibility to include various actions and events that would require institutions to provide the DOE with irrevocable letters of credit upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. For additional information regarding this rule and current rulemaking, see \u201c-The DOE has adopted regulations governing federal student loan debt forgiveness that could result in liability for amounts based on borrower defenses or affect the DOE\u2019s assessment of our institutional capability.\u201d If we are required to repay the DOE for any successful DTR claims by students who attended Walden University, or we are required to obtain additional letters of credit or increase our current letter of credit, it could materially affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nIn addition, an institution participating in Title IV programs must calculate the amount of unearned Title IV program funds that it has disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completing such programs and must return those unearned funds to the appropriate lender or the DOE in a timely manner, generally within 45 days of the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn. If Walden University does not properly calculate and timely return the unearned funds for a sufficient percentage of students, it may have to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE equal to 25% of Title IV program funds that should have been returned for such students in the prior fiscal year. Additionally, if Walden University does not correctly calculate and timely return unearned Title IV program funds, it may be liable for repayment of Title IV funds and related interest and may be fined, sanctioned, or otherwise subject to adverse actions by the DOE, including termination of its participation in Title IV programs. Any of these adverse actions could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe DOE may change Walden University\u2019s method of receiving Title IV program funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity.\nThe DOE can impose sanctions for violating the statutory and regulatory requirements of Title IV programs, including transferring Walden University from the advance method or the heightened cash monitoring level one method of Title IV payment, each of which permits an institution to receive Title IV funds before or concurrently with disbursing them to students, to the heightened cash monitoring level two method of payment or to the reimbursement method of payment, each of which may significantly delay an institution\u2019s receipt of Title IV funds until student eligibility has been verified by the DOE. Any such delay in Walden University\u2019s receipt of Title IV program funds may materially adversely affect our cash flows and we may require additional working capital or third-party funding to finance our operations.\nWalden University may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the percentage of its revenues derived from Title IV programs is too high.\nA provision of the HEA commonly referred to as the \u201c90/10 Rule\u201d provides that a for-profit educational institution loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if, under a complex regulatory formula that requires cash basis accounting and other adjustments to the calculation of revenues, the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues from Title IV program funds for any two consecutive fiscal years. If Walden University were to violate the 90/10 Rule, it would become ineligible to participate in Title IV programs as of the first day of the fiscal year following the second consecutive fiscal year in which it exceeded the 90% threshold and would be unable to regain eligibility for two fiscal years thereafter. In addition, an institution that derives more than 90% of its revenue (on a cash basis) from Title IV programs for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years and may be subject to additional conditions or sanctions imposed by the DOE. Using the DOE\u2019s formula under the \u201c90/10 Rule,\u201d Walden University derived approximately 76% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nWalden University\u2019s ratio could increase in the future. Congressional increases in students\u2019 Title IV grant and loan limits may result in an increase in the revenues we receive from Title IV programs. In recent years, legislation has been introduced in Congress that would revise the 90/10 Rule to consider educational benefits for veterans and military personnel from the Department of Veteran Affairs and Department of Defense, respectively, in the same manner as Title IV funds for purposes of the rule, to prohibit institutions from participating in Title IV programs for one year if they derive more than 90% of their total revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from the Title IV programs and these other federal programs in a single fiscal year rather than the current rule of two consecutive fiscal years. During the 116th Congress, the U.S. House of Representatives considered legislation that would have revised the 90/10 Rule to an 85/15 rule and consider educational benefits for veterans and military personnel from the Department of Veteran Affairs and Department of Defense, respectively, in the same manner as Title IV funds for purposes of the rule. We cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, any of these proposed revisions may be considered in the current 117th Congress or enacted into law. In addition, reductions in state appropriations in a number of areas, including with respect to the amount of financial assistance provided to post-secondary students, could further increase Walden University\u2019s percentages of revenues derived from Title IV program funds. The employment circumstances of our students or their parents could also increase reliance on Title IV program funds. If Walden University becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs as a result of noncompliance with the 90/10 Rule, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWalden University may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if its student loan default rates are too high.\nAn educational institution may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if, for three consecutive years, 30% or more of its students who were required to begin repayment on their federal student loans in the relevant fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the next federal fiscal year. In addition, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the default rate as determined by the DOE of its students exceeds 40% for any single year. The DOE generally publishes official cohort default rates annually in September for the repayment period that ended the prior September 30.\nWalden University\u2019s official cohort default rates for the 2017, 2016, and 2015 federal fiscal years were 6.8%, 6.9%, and 7.3%, respectively. The average national student loan default rates published by the DOE for all institutions that participated in the federal student aid programs for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were 9.7%, 10.1%, and 10.8%, respectively, and for all proprietary institutions that participated in the federal student aid programs for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were 14.7%, 15.2%, and 15.6%, respectively.\nWhile we do not believe that Walden University is in danger of exceeding the regulatory default rate thresholds for other Title IV programs, we cannot provide any assurance that this will continue to be the case. Any increase in interest rates on federal loans, as well as declines in income or job losses for our students, could contribute to higher default rates on student loans.\nExceeding the student loan default rate thresholds and losing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any future changes in the formula for calculating student loan default rates, economic conditions or other factors that cause our default rates to increase, could place Walden University in danger of losing its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to sanctions or other adverse legal actions if Walden University were to pay impermissible commissions, bonuses or other incentive payments to individuals involved in or with responsibility for certain recruiting, admission or financial aid activities.\nUnder the HEA, an institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or admissions or awarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based in any part, directly or indirectly, on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. Failure to comply could result in monetary penalties and/or sanctions imposed by the DOE, which could result in lower enrollments, revenue, and net operating income. The law and regulations governing this requirement do not establish clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, creating uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation, rendering development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish.\nIn addition, in recent years, several for-profit education companies have been faced with whistleblower lawsuits under the Federal False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d cases, by current or former employees alleging violations of the prohibition against incentive compensation. If the DOE were to determine that we or Walden University violated the prohibition regarding impermissible commissions, or if we were to be found liable in a False Claims action alleging a violation of this law, or if any third parties we have engaged were to violate this law, we could be fined or sanctioned by the DOE, or subjected to other monetary liability or penalties that could be substantial, including the possibility of treble damages under a False Claims action, any of which could harm our reputation, impose significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nHigher educational institutions are susceptible to an increased risk of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and student financial aid programs. The DOE\u2019s regulations require institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the Office of Inspector General credible information indicating that any applicant, employee, third-party servicer or agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves administration of the Title IV programs has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs. We cannot be certain that our systems and processes will always be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated and ever-changing fraud schemes. The potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened due to Walden University offering various educational programs via distance education. Any significant failure by Walden University to adequately detect fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could result in loss of accreditation at the discretion of its accrediting agency, which would result in it losing eligibility for Title IV programs, or in direct action by the DOE to limit or terminate its Title IV program participation. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment, regulatory agencies, accrediting bodies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims or initiate litigation against us.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we may be subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. For example, on September 14, 2020, Walden University received a letter from the DOJ indicating that the DOJ is examining whether Walden University, in the operation of its Masters of Science in Nursing program, may have violated the Federal False Claims Act by misrepresenting compliance with its program participation agreement with the DOE, which agreement covers Walden University\u2019s participation in federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the U.S. Higher Education Act. For further detail, see \u201c-Increased regulatory and enforcement effort of consumer protection laws could be a catalyst for legislative or regulatory restrictions, investigations, enforcement actions and claims that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d\nOn September 8, 2016, the Minnesota Office of Higher Education (\u201cMOHE\u201d) sent to Walden University an information request regarding its doctoral programs and complaints filed by doctoral students as part of a program review that MOHE was conducting. On October 23, 2019, MOHE completed its program review and issued a final report that indicated no findings of\nnoncompliance. As part of its report, MOHE made recommendations for Walden University to develop certain goals and benchmarks with respect to its doctoral programs.\nIf the results of any federal proceeding are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of eligibility for Title IV program funding at Walden University, injunctions or other penalties. We may also lose or have limitations imposed on our accreditations, licensing or Title IV program participation, be required to pay monetary damages or be limited in our ability to open new institutions or add new program offerings. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. Additionally, we may experience adverse collateral consequences, including declines in the number of students enrolling at our institutions and the willingness of third parties to deal with us or our institutions, as a result of any negative publicity associated with such reviews, claims or litigation. Claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation or cause us to incur expenses, even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nThe fact that we have substantial debt could materially adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to pursue our strategy or to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nWe have substantial debt. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding: (a) a multi-currency revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) scheduled to mature in October 2024; (b) senior notes consisting of Senior Notes due 2025; and (c) other long term indebtedness, consisting of capital lease obligations, notes payable, seller notes and borrowings against certain lines of credit. Our debt could have important negative consequences to our business, including:\n\u2022increasing the difficulty of our ability to make payments on our outstanding debt;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions because our debt payment obligations may limit our ability to use our cash to respond to or defend against changes in the industry or the economy;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities or to pay dividends;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our ability to pursue our strategy;\n\u2022limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the senior secured credit agreement governing our Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nOur debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe senior secured credit agreement governing our Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025 contain various covenants that may limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022pay dividends and make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create certain liens or encumbrances;\n\u2022preserve our corporate existence;\n\u2022merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the senior secured credit agreement governing our Revolving Credit Facility provides for compliance with the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio, as defined in the senior secured credit agreement, which is tested quarterly. The maximum ratio, as defined, was 3.5x at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with this covenant.\nThe senior secured credit agreement governing our Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025 also include cross-default provisions applicable to other agreements. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreement governing such indebtedness, including as a result of cross-default provisions. In addition, failure to make payments or observe certain covenants on the indebtedness of our subsidiaries may cause a cross default on our Revolving Credit Facility and our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025. Upon our failure to maintain compliance with these covenants, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders under such indebtedness accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings, as well as our other indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our Revolving Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nWe rely on contractual arrangements and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our operating subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nWe conduct all of our operations through certain of our subsidiaries, and we have no significant assets other than cash of $632.5 million as of December 31, 2020 held at corporate entities and the capital stock or other control rights of our subsidiaries. As a result, we rely on payments from contractual arrangements, such as intellectual property royalty, network fee and management services agreements. In addition, we also rely upon intercompany loan repayments and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet any existing or future debt service and other obligations, a substantial portion of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make distributions or other payments to their parent companies or directly to us will depend on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization, regulatory requirements, agreements entered into by those operating subsidiaries and the covenants of any existing or future outstanding indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries may incur. Further, because most of our income is generated by our operating subsidiaries in non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies, our ability to service our U.S. dollar denominated debt obligations may be affected by any strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the functional currencies of our operating subsidiaries.\nDisruptions of the credit and equity markets worldwide may impede or prevent our access to the capital markets for additional funding to conduct our business and may affect the availability or cost of borrowing under our existing credit facility.\nThe credit and equity markets of both mature and developing economies have historically experienced extraordinary volatility, asset erosion and uncertainty, leading to governmental intervention in the banking sector in the United States and abroad. If these market disruptions occur in the future, we may not be able to access the capital markets to obtain funding needed to refinance our existing indebtedness or conduct our business. In addition, changes in the capital or other legal requirements applicable to commercial lenders may affect the availability or increase the cost of borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility. If we are unable to obtain needed capital on terms acceptable to us, we may need to limit our growth initiatives or take other actions that materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Investing in Our Class A Common Stock\nAs a public benefit corporation, our focus on a specific public benefit purpose and producing a positive effect for society may negatively influence our financial performance.\nAs a public benefit corporation, we may take actions that we believe will benefit our students and the surrounding communities, even if those actions do not maximize our short- or medium-term financial results. While we believe that this designation and obligation will benefit the Company given the importance to our long-term success of our commitment to education, it could cause our board of directors to make decisions and take actions not in keeping with the short-term or more narrow interests of our stockholders. Any longer-term benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all and may have an immediate negative effect. For example:\n\u2022we may choose to revise our policies in ways that we believe will be beneficial to our students and their communities in the long term, even though the changes may be costly in the short- or medium-term;\n\u2022we may take actions, such as modernizing campuses to provide students with the latest technology, even though these actions may be more costly than other alternatives;\n\u2022in exiting a market that is not meeting our goals, we may choose to \u201cteach out\u201d the existing student body over several years rather than lose an institution; even though this could be substantially more expensive;\n\u2022we may be influenced to pursue programs and services to demonstrate our commitment to our students and communities even though there is no immediate return to our stockholders; or\n\u2022in responding to a possible proposal to acquire the Company and/or any business unit, our board of directors may be influenced by the interests of our employees, students, teachers and others whose interests may be different from the interests of our stockholders.\nWe may be unable or slow to realize the long-term benefits we expect from actions taken to benefit our students and communities in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nWe completed our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) in February 2017. Since our IPO, the price of our Class A common stock, as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market, has ranged from a low of $7.67 on May 13, 2020 to a high of $21.62 on January 30, 2020. The trading price of our Class A common stock may continue to fluctuate and is dependent upon a number of factors, including those described in this \u201cItem 1A - Risk Factors\u201d section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock, as you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid, or at all.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of our management team from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nIn addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our Class A common stock is low. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment.\nIf we or our existing investors sell or announce an intention to sell additional shares of our Class A common stock, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Class A common stock in the market, or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to raise capital through future sales of equity securities at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate, or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 90,791,807 shares of our Class B common stock were outstanding. Such amount excludes 287,125 shares of Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding vested stock options under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2007 Plan\u201d), 2,073,863 shares of Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding vested stock options under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \u201c2013 Plan\u201d), 998,814 shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2013 Plan, and 7,430 shares of Class B common stock reserved for future issuance under the Laureate Education, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the \u201cDeferred Compensation Plan\u201d). All of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock became eligible for sale on August 5, 2017. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class B common stock, which will automatically convert into Class A common stock upon sale, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay ordinary cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and our debt arrangements place certain restrictions on our ability to do so, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any ordinary cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur, including our Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture governing our outstanding notes. In addition, we are permitted under the terms of our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness, which may restrict or prevent us from paying dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, our ability to declare and pay dividends may be limited by instruments governing future outstanding indebtedness we may incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Class A common stock unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our initial public offering, including Wengen and our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, and limiting your ability to influence corporate matters.\nEach share of our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and each share of our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of February 12, 2021, stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock, including Wengen, and our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, together hold approximately 89% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore have significant influence over the management affairs of the Company and control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. Because of the 10-to-1 voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock even when the shares of Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock.\nThe Wengen investors have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and the ability to prevent any transaction that requires stockholder approval regardless of whether others believe that the transaction is in our best interests. So long as the Wengen investors continue to have an indirect interest in a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock, they have the ability to control the vote in any election of directors. This concentrated control limits your ability to influence corporate matters. The interests of the Wengen investors and other holders of Class B common stock may not coincide with the interests of holders of the Class A common stock. In addition, in connection with the completion of our IPO, we entered into a new Wengen Securityholders\u2019 Agreement dated as of February 6, 2017, by and among Wengen, Laureate and the other parties thereto, pursuant to which certain of the Wengen investors have certain rights to appoint directors to our board of directors and its committees.\nIn addition, the Wengen investors are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies and may hold, and may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Holders of our securities do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nWengen controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022the requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating/corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe currently utilize some of these exemptions and intend to continue to do so. As a result, our nominating and corporate governance committee and our compensation committee do not consist entirely of independent directors and such committees are not subject to annual performance evaluations. Accordingly, for so long as we are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d you will not have the same protections afforded to holders of securities of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and could discourage a takeover and adversely affect the holders of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of the Company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to the holders of our Class A common stock. These provisions include:\n\u2022the dual class structure of our common stock;\n\u2022authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022prohibiting the use of cumulative voting for the election of directors;\n\u2022limiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings or amend our bylaws;\n\u2022following the conversion of all of our Class B common stock into Class A common stock, requiring that all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022establishing advance notice and duration of ownership requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nWe may issue additional shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our Class A common stock, which could depress the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of any additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Additional series of preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our Class A common stock. The potential issuance of an additional series of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discourage bids for our Class A common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock.\nThe provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requiring exclusive venue in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine will have to be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware unless we otherwise consent in writing to an alternative form. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. We believe that this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies. This choice of forum provision, however, may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The choice of forum provision in the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nIf we do not maintain adequate coverage of our Class A common stock by securities analysts or if they publish unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our Class A common stock, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock could be affected by any research or reports that securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us or our business downgrade their evaluations of our Class A common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. We may be unable to maintain adequate research coverage, and if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market for our Class A common stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 16591, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "LAUR"}
