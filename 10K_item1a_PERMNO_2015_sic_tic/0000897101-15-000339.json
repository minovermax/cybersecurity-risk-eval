RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s three business segments described above are all subject to a number of risk factors, the occurrence of any one or more of which could have a significant adverse impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of the Company as a whole.\nHousewares/Small Appliance Segment:\nIncreases in the costs for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies could adversely affect the results of the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s suppliers purchase significant amounts of metals, plastics, and energy to manufacture the Company\u2019s products. Also, the cost of fuel has a major impact on transportation costs. Any increased costs that cannot be fully absorbed or passed along in the form of price increases to the retail customer can have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nReliance on third-party suppliers in Asia makes this segment vulnerable to supply interruptions and foreign business risks.\nThe majority of the housewares/small appliance products are manufactured by a handful of third-party suppliers in Asia, primarily in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The Company\u2019s ability to continue to select and develop relationships with reliable vendors who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact its success in meeting customer demand. Most products are procured on a \u201cpurchase order\u201d basis. As a result, the Company may be subject to unexpected changes in pricing or supply of products. There is no assurance that it could quickly or effectively replace any of its vendors if the need arose. Any significant failure to obtain products on a timely basis at an affordable cost or any significant delays or interruptions of supply may disrupt customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nIn addition, international manufacturing is subject to significant risks, including, among others, labor unrest, adverse social, political and economic conditions, interruptions in international shipments, tariffs and other trade barriers, legal and regulatory constraints and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although China currently enjoys \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status with the United States, the U.S. Government has in the past proposed to revoke that status and to impose higher tariffs on products imported from China, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Housewares/Small Appliance segment is dependent on key customers, and any significant decline in business from one or more of its key customers could adversely affect the segment\u2019s operating results.\nAlthough the Company has a long-established relationship with its major customers, it does not have any long-term supply agreement or guaranty of minimum purchases. As a result, the customers may fail to place anticipated orders, change planned quantities, delay purchases, or change product assortments for reasons beyond the Company\u2019s control, which could prove detrimental to the segment\u2019s operating results.\nThe sales for this segment are highly seasonal and dependent upon the United States retail markets and consumer spending.\nTraditionally, this segment has recognized a substantial portion of its sales during the Holiday selling season. Any downturn in the general economy, shift in consumer spending away from its housewares/small appliances, or deterioration in the financial health of its customer base could adversely affect sales and operating results.\nThe Company may not be successful in developing and introducing new and improved consumer products.\nThe development and introduction of new housewares/small appliance products is very important to the Company\u2019s long-term success. The ability to develop new products is affected by, among other things, whether the Company can develop and fund technological innovations and successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, as well as the intellectual property rights of others. The introduction of new products may require substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain marketplace recognition or to license intellectual property. There is no guarantee that the Company will be aware of all relevant intellectual property in the industry and may be subject to claims of infringement, which could preclude it from producing and selling a product. Likewise, there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in developing products necessary to compete effectively in the industry or that it will be successful in advertising, marketing and selling any new products.\nProduct recalls or lawsuits relating to defective products could have an adverse effect on the Company, as could the imposition of industry sustainability standards.\nAs distributors of consumer products in the United States, the Company is subject to the Consumer Products Safety Act, which empowers the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission could require the Company to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of its products, or it may voluntarily do so. Any repurchase or recall of products could be costly and damage the Company\u2019s reputation, as well as subject it to a sizable penalty that the Commission is empowered to impose. If the Company removed products from the market, its reputation or brands could be tarnished and it might have large quantities of finished products that could not be sold.\nThe Company could also face exposure to product liability claims if one of its products were alleged to have caused property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects. It is self-insured to specified levels of those claims and maintains product liability insurance for claims above the self-insured levels. The Company may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, in the future. In addition, product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage. Moreover, many states do not allow insurance companies to provide coverage of punitive damages, in the event such damages are imposed. Additionally, the Company does not maintain product recall insurance. As a result, product recalls or product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe portable appliance and floor care companies\u2019 industry association is in the process of trying to promulgate sustainability standards for the industry. It has passed an outline for a standard but has not yet developed specific guidelines for implementation. The Sustainability Consortium (TSC) under the auspices of a Retail Association (RILA) is trying to develop standards for all consumer products. If either the association or TSC is successful in developing enforceable standards, the standards are expected to ultimately become mandatory. The standards as drafted will do nothing for the environment, but will entail the addition of significant bureaucracy and outside certification fees. As such, compliance will be burdensome and expensive.\nThe housewares/small appliance industry continues to consolidate, which could ultimately impede the Company\u2019s ability to secure product placement at key customers.\nOver the past decade, the housewares/small appliance industry has undergone significant consolidation, and, as a result, the industry primarily consists of a limited number of larger companies. Larger companies do enjoy a competitive advantage in terms of the ability to offer a larger assortment of product to any one customer. As a result, the Company may find it more difficult or lose the ability to place its products with its customers.\nDefense Segment:\nThe Company relies primarily on sales to U.S. Government entities, and the loss of a significant contract or contracts could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\nAs the Company\u2019s sales in the Defense segment are primarily to the U.S. Government and its prime contractors, it depends heavily on the contracts underlying these programs. The loss or significant reduction of a major program in which the Company participates could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations.\nIn April 2005, AMTEC Corporation was selected as one of two prime contractors responsible for supplying all requirements for 40mm practice and tactical ammunition rounds for the Army\u2019s five year 40mm systems program. AMTEC\u2019s deliveries to the Army over the life of the contract exceeded $671,000,000. In February 2010, the Army awarded AMTEC a new contract for an additional five-year period. As in the original contract, AMTEC and one other prime contractor were to be responsible for supplying all of the requirements for the 40mm family of ammunition rounds. In November 2013, AMTEC acquired through a novation agreement as part of an acquisition of a group of assets (see Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the remaining undelivered portion of the award that had been given to AMTEC\u2019s competitor under the second five-year contract mentioned above. The actual annual and cumulative dollar volume with the Army will be dependent on military requirements and funding. Total deliveries under the systems program for the most recent 40mm contract were $124,000,000 during 2014.\nOn January 29, 2015, AMTEC submitted its proposal to the Army in response to the next five-year contract solicitation for the management and production of the 40mm Ammunition System. AMTEC has been advised by the Army that a decision on any contract award will be made in the second quarter of 2015.\nA decline in or a redirection of the U.S. defense budget could result in a material decrease in the Defense segment sales and earnings.\nGovernment contracts are primarily dependent upon the U.S. defense budget. During recent years, the Company\u2019s sales have been augmented by increased defense spending, including supplemental appropriations for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, future defense budgets could be negatively affected by several factors, including U.S. Government budget deficits, administration priorities, U.S. national security strategies, a change in spending priorities, the complete withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the reduction of military operations in other parts of the world. Any significant decline or redirection of U.S. military expenditures could result in a decrease to the Company\u2019s sales and earnings.\nU.S. Government contracts are also dependent on the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. As a result, at the outset of a major program, the contract is usually incrementally funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as Congress makes appropriations for future fiscal years. In addition, most U.S. Government contracts are subject to modification if funding is changed. Any failure by Congress to appropriate additional funds to any program in which the Company participates, or any contract modification as a result of funding changes, could materially delay or terminate the program. This could have a material adverse effect on the results of the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company may not be able to react to increases in its costs due to the nature of its U.S. Government contracts.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s U.S. Government contracts are being performed on fixed-price basis. Under fixed-price contracts, the Company agrees to perform the work for a fixed price, subject to limited escalation provisions on specified raw materials. Thus it bears the risk that any increases or unexpected costs may reduce profits or potentially cause losses on the contract, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition. That risk is potentially compounded by the political actions under consideration by federal and state governments, including climate change and labor regulations, which could have an impact if enacted or promulgated on the availability of affordable labor, energy and ultimately, materials, as the effects of the legislation/regulation ripple throughout the economy. In addition, products are accepted by test firing samples from a production lot. Lots typically constitute a sizable amount of product. Should a sample not fire as required by the specifications, the cost to rework or scrap the entire lot could be substantial.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination.\nAll of the Company\u2019s U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government either for its convenience or if the Company defaults by failing to perform under the contract. Performance failure can occur from a myriad of factors, which include late shipments due to the inability to secure requisite raw materials or components or strikes or other labor unrest, equipment failures or quality issues which result in products that do not meet specifications, etc. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for recovery of costs incurred and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. If a termination provision is exercised, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure of the Company\u2019s subcontractors to perform their contractual obligations could materially and adversely impact contract performance.\nKey components and services are provided by third party subcontractors, several of which the segment is required to work with by government edict. Under the contract, the segment is responsible for the performance of those subcontractors, many of which it does not control. There is a risk that the Company may have disputes with its subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by subcontractors. A failure by one or more of the Company\u2019s subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to perform its obligations as the prime contractor.\nAbsorbent Products Segment:\nThe Absorbent Products segment is dependent on key customers, and any significant decline in business from one or more of its key customers could adversely affect the segment\u2019s operating results.\nOne customer, Medline Industries Holdings LP, accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in 2011. In fourth quarter 2011, Medline began operating its own absorbent products facility. As a result, sales to Medline for 2012, 2013, and 2014 declined significantly. During the last several years, the Absorbent Products segment has been implementing a customer diversification program to reduce its reliance on this customer and in the process has developed smaller, albeit new key customers whose loss could also adversely affect the segment\u2019s results.\nIncreases in costs for raw materials, transportation, energy and other supplies could adversely affect the results of its operations.\nAt times, the Company has experienced significant increases in its raw material, transportation, energy, and other supply costs primarily due to limited global supply and increased demand. Any increased costs that cannot be fully absorbed or passed along in the form of price increases to its customers could adversely affect earnings. Global economic conditions, supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of, or prices for, those raw materials. The risk is further compounded by the political actions under consideration by federal and state governments, including climate change and labor regulations, which could have an impact if enacted or promulgated on the availability of affordable labor, energy, and ultimately, materials, as the effects of the legislation ripple throughout the economy.\nThe Company may not be successful in developing and introducing new and improved absorbent products.\nThe development and introduction of new absorbent products is very important to long-term success. The ability to develop new products is affected by, among other things, whether the Company can develop and fund technological innovations and successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences. The introduction of new products may require substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain marketplace recognition or to license intellectual property. There is no guarantee that it will be aware of all relevant intellectual property in the industry and may be subject to claims of infringement, which could preclude it from producing and selling a product. Likewise, there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in developing products necessary to compete effectively in the industry or that it will be successful in advertising, marketing and selling new products it develops.\nThe inability to operate the Company\u2019s manufacturing facility at or near full capacity could adversely affect the result of operations.\nThe Absorbent Products segment is a very capital-intensive business, utilizing high cost, high-speed equipment. Since the segment operates in a market that is highly competitive with relatively low margins, it is essential to operate near full capacity to achieve high efficiencies and profitable financial results.\nAcquisition Risks:\nThe Company may pursue acquisitions of new product lines or businesses. It may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or, if suitable candidates are identified, it may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially acceptable terms. Even if the Company is able to consummate an acquisition, the transaction would present many risks, including, among others: failing to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings; difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies, services or products; coordinating, establishing or expanding sales, distribution and marketing functions, as necessary; diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; being exposed to unanticipated or contingent liabilities or incurring the impairment of goodwill; the loss of key employees, customers, or distribution partners; and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls, policies and procedures over the systems, products and processes of the acquired company. If the Company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by management, or if others do not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as the Company does, there could be a material, adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInformation Technology System Failure or Security Breach Risks:\nThe Company relies on its information technology systems to effectively manage its business data, communications, supply chain, logistics, accounting, and other business processes. While the Company endeavors to build and sustain an appropriate technology environment, information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company\u2019s control, including systems failures, viruses, security breaches or cyber incidents such as intentional cyber attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data, or inadvertent cyber-security compromises. A security breach of such systems could result in interruptions of the Company\u2019s operations, negatively impact relations with customers or employees, and expose the Company to liability and litigation. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results.", "PERMNO": 34497, "SIC": 3480, "TIC": "NPK"}
