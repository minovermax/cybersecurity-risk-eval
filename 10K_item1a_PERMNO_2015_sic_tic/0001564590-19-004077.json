Our results could be adversely affected if economic conditions weaken. In the event of significant currency weakening in the countries into which our products are sold, demand for or pricing of our products could be adversely impacted. Also, there may be periods during which demand for our products is insufficient to enable us to operate our production facilities in an economical manner. As a result, we may be forced to take machine downtime to curtail production to match demand. The economic environment may also cause customer insolvencies which may result in their inability to satisfy their financial obligations to us. These conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our sales and results of operations.\nApproximately $88 million of our net sales in 2018 was earned from customers located in Ukraine, Russia and members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (also known as \u201cCIS\u201d). Uncertain geo-political conditions, this region\u2019s economic environment and volatile currencies may cause demand for our products to be volatile and cause abrupt changes in our customers buying patterns.\nApproximately 58% of our net sales in 2018 were shipped to customers in Europe, the demand for which is dependent on economic conditions in this area, or to the extent such customers do business outside of Europe, in other regions of the world. Uncertain economic conditions in this region may cause weakness in demand for our products as well as volatility in our customers buying patterns.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated from operations outside of the United States. In addition, we own and operate manufacturing facilities in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Philippines. A significant portion of our business is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar including the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Philippine peso, among others. Our euro denominated revenue exceeds euro expenses by an estimated \u20ac160 million. With respect to the British pound, Canadian dollar and Philippine peso, we have greater outflows than inflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant.\nIn the event that one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, business may be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established.\nOur ability to maintain our products' price competitiveness is reliant, in part, on the relative strength of the currency in which the product is denominated compared to the currency of the market into which it is sold and the functional currency of our competitors. Changes in the rate of exchange of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and other currencies, may adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to offer products in certain markets at acceptable prices. For example, approximately $88 million of our revenue in 2018 was earned from shipments to customers located in Ukraine, Russia and members of the CIS. Although these sales are denominated in euros, a significant weakening of the customers\u2019 local currencies may adversely affect our revenue, our customers\u2019 credit risk and our results of operation.\nThe cost of raw materials and energy used to manufacture our products could increase or the availability of certain raw materials could become constrained.\nWe require access to sufficient, and reasonably priced, quantities of pulps, pulp substitutes, abaca fiber, synthetic fibers, and certain other raw materials, as well as access to reliable and abundant supplies of water to support many of our production facilities. We require significant quantities of wood pulps and, therefore, the volatility of wood pulp prices can have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nOur Philippine mill purchases abaca fiber to produce abaca pulp, a key material used to manufacture paper for single-serve coffee, tea and technical specialty products at Composite Fibers\u2019 facilities. At certain times, the supply of abaca fiber has been constrained or the quality diminished due to factors such as weather-related damage to the source crop as well as decisions by land owners to produce alternative crops in lieu of those used to produce abaca fiber. These factors have contributed to volatility in fiber prices or limited available supply.\nAdvanced Airlaid requires access to sufficient quantities of fluff pulp, the supply of which is subject to availability of certain softwoods.\nThe cost of many of our production materials, including petroleum-based chemicals and freight charges, are influenced by the cost of oil. Natural gas is the principal source of fuel for each of our facilities worldwide and has historically been more volatile than other fuels. More recently, Europe has experienced a sharp rise in the price of electricity.\nGLATFELTER 2018 FORM 10-K\nGovernment rules, regulations and policies have an impact on the cost of certain energy sources, particularly for our European operations. In Europe, we currently benefit from a number of government-sponsored programs related to, among others, green energy or renewable energy initiatives designed to mitigate the cost of electricity to larger industrial consumers of power. Any reduction in the extent of government sponsored incentives may adversely affect the cost ultimately borne by our operations. Furthermore, the European Commission is investigating certain energy programs in Germany from which we benefit as to whether the programs comply with European Union rules on state aid. The outcome of these investigations could require us to return certain benefits previously earned or reduce such benefits in the future and could impact our results of operations.\nAlthough we have contractual arrangements with certain Advanced Airlaid customers pursuant to which our product\u2019s selling price is adjusted for changes in the cost of certain raw materials, we may not be able to fully pass increased raw materials or energy costs on to all customers if the market will not bear the higher price or if existing agreements limit price increases. If price adjustments significantly trail increases in raw materials or energy prices, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur industry is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales and profitability.\nThe global markets in which we compete, although growing, are served by a variety of competitors. As a result, our ability to compete is sensitive to, and may be adversely impacted by, the following:\n\u2022\nthe entry of new competitors into the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nthe aggressiveness of our competitors\u2019 pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share;\n\u2022\nour failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences; and\n\u2022\ntechnological advances or changes that impact production or cost competitiveness of our products.\nThe impact of any significant changes may result in our inability to effectively compete in the markets in which we operate, and as a result our sales and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to develop new products acceptable to our existing or potential customers.\nOur business strategy is market focused and includes investments in developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers, serve new customers and to maintain our market share. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that keep pace with introductions by our competitors and changing customer preferences. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these factors, we may lose opportunities for business with both current and potential customers. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nanticipate and properly identify our customers' needs and industry trends;\n\u2022\ndevelop and commercialize new products and applications in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nprice our products competitively;\n\u2022\ndifferentiate our products from our competitors' products; and\n\u2022\ninvest efficiently in research and development activities.\nOur inability to develop new products or new business opportunities could adversely impact our business and ultimately harm our profitability.\nWe are subject to substantial costs and potential liability for environmental matters.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances. To comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial capital and operating expenditures.\nWe may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment, such as air and water quality, resulting from mills we operate or have operated. Potential obligations include compensation for the restoration of natural resources, personal injury and property damages.\nWe have exposure to potential liability for remediation and other costs related to the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the lower Fox River on which our former Neenah, Wisconsin mill was located. As more fully discussed in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 21, this is a complex matter and has involved several years of litigation. In January 2019, we entered into a consent decree with government agencies which we believe resolves our liability for the site.\nAdvanced Airlaid generates a substantial portion of its revenue from one customer serving the hygiene products market, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe majority of Advanced Airlaid Materials\u2019 sales of hygiene products are to one customer. In addition, sales to the feminine hygiene market accounted for 63% of Advanced Airlaid Materials\u2019 net sales in 2018 and sales are concentrated within a small group of large customers. The loss of the large customer or a decline in sales of hygiene products could have a material adverse effect on this business\u2019s operating results. Our ability to effectively compete could be affected by technological production alternatives which could provide substitute products into this market segment. Customers in the airlaid nonwoven fabric material market, including the hygiene market, may also switch to less expensive products, change preferences or otherwise reduce demand for Advanced Airlaid Materials\u2019 products, thus reducing the size of the markets in which it currently sells its products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business prospects.\nOur operations may be impaired and we may be exposed to potential losses and liability as a result of natural disasters, acts of terrorism or sabotage or similar events.\nIf we have a catastrophic loss or unforeseen operational problem at any of our facilities, we could suffer significant lost production which could impair our ability to satisfy customer demands.\nNatural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding or fire, and acts of terrorism or sabotage affecting our operating activities and major facilities could materially and adversely affect our operations, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, many of our operations require a reliable and abundant supply of water. Such mills rely on a local water body or water source for their water needs and, therefore, are particularly sensitive to drought conditions or other natural or manmade interruptions to water supplies. At various times and for differing periods, we have had to modify operations at certain of our mills due to water shortages, water clarity, or low flow conditions in its principal water supplies. Any interruption or curtailment of operations at any of our production facilities due to drought or low flow conditions at the principal water source or another cause could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur pulp mill in Lanao del Norte on the Island of Mindanao in the Republic of the Philippines is located along the Pacific Rim, one of the world\u2019s hazard belts. By virtue of its geographic location, this mill is subject to similar types of natural disasters discussed above, cyclones, typhoons, and volcanic activity. Moreover, the area of Lanao del Norte has been a target of suspected terrorist activities. Our pulp mill in Mindanao is located in a rural portion of the island and is susceptible to attacks and/or power interruptions. The Mindanao mill supplies the abaca pulp used by our Composite Fibers business unit to manufacture paper for single serve coffee and tea products and certain technical specialties products. Any interruption, loss or extended curtailment of operations at our Mindanao mill could affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products and materially affect our operating results and financial condition.\nGLATFELTER 2018 FORM 10-K\nWe have operations in a potentially politically and economically unstable location.\nOur pulp mill in the Philippines is located in a region that is unstable and subject to political unrest. As discussed above, our Philippine pulp mill produces abaca pulp, a significant raw material used by our Composite Fibers business unit and is currently our main provider of abaca pulp. There are limited suitable alternative sources of readily available abaca pulp in the world. In the event of a disruption in supply from our Philippine mill, there is no guarantee that we could obtain adequate amounts of abaca pulp, if at all, from alternative sources at a reasonable price. Further, there is no assurance the performance of such alternative materials will satisfy customer performance requirements. As a consequence, any civil disturbance, unrest, political instability or other event that causes a disruption in supply could limit the availability of abaca pulp and would increase our cost of obtaining abaca pulp. Such occurrences could adversely impact our sales volumes, revenues and operating results.\nOur international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.\nWe have significant operations and assets located in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of unique risks, in addition to the risks in our domestic sales and operations, including, but not limited to, economic and trade disruptions resulting from geopolitical developments such as \u201cBrexit,\u201d differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, differing regulatory environments, difficulty in managing widespread operations and political instability. These factors may adversely affect our future profits. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. Any such limitations would restrict our flexibility in using funds generated in those jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to cyber-security risks related to unauthorized or malicious access to sensitive customer, vendor, company or employee information as well as to the technology that supports our operations and other business processes.\nOur business operations rely upon secure systems for mill operations, and data capture, processing, storage and reporting. Although we maintain appropriate data security and controls, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers, could become subject to cyberattacks. Systems such as ours are inherently exposed to cyber-security risks and potential attacks. The result of such attacks could result in a breach of data security and controls. Such a breach of our network, systems, applications or data could result in operational disruptions or damage or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us, denial of access to the applications we use to plan our operations, procure materials, manufacture and ship products and account for orders, theft of intellectual knowhow and trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents.\nAny of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could adversely affect our results of operations, create negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business.\nWe operate in and are subject to taxation from numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.\nThe multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the U.S and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in tax laws or their interpretation or changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. For example, the European Commission has opened formal investigations to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in certain European countries comply with European Union rules on state aid. The outcome of the European Commission\u2019s investigations could require changes to existing tax rulings that, in turn, could have an impact on our income taxes and results of operations.\nIn the event any of the above risk factors impact our business in a material way or in combination during the same period, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to simultaneously fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy obligations and make dividend payments on our common stock.\nIn addition to debt service obligations, our business requires expenditures to support growth strategies, research and development initiatives, and for normal upgrades or replacements. We expect to meet all of our near and long-term cash needs from a combination of operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents, availability under our credit facility or other long-term debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from these sources, we could be unable to fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy our near and long-term cash needs or make dividend payments.", "PERMNO": 57154, "SIC": 2621, "TIC": "GLT"}
