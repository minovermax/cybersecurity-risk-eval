{"cik": "1023364", "company": "AutoWeb, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below are not the only risks that we face. The following risks as well as risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, earnings per share, cash flow or the trading price of our stock, individually and collectively referred to in these Risk Factors as our \u201cfinancial performance.\u201d See also the discussion of \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d immediately preceding Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Associated with our Business Operations and Industry\nWe may be unable to increase Lead revenues and could continue to suffer declining revenues due to Dealer attrition or loss of Manufacturer customers.\nWe predominately derive our Lead revenues from Lead fees paid by Dealers and Manufacturers participating in our Leads programs. Our Lead revenues decreased $9.0 million, or 15%, in 2021 compared to 2020. Our ability to increase revenues from sales of Leads is dependent on a mix of interrelated factors that include attracting and retaining Dealers and Manufacturers and increasing the number of high-quality Leads we sell to Dealers and Manufacturers. Our Lead sales strategy is intended to result in more profitable relationships with our Dealers both in terms of cost to supply Leads and to support the Dealers. Dealer churn and termination of Manufacturer Lead programs impact our revenues, and if our sales strategy does not mitigate the loss in revenues by maintaining the overall number of Leads sold by increasing sales to other Dealers or Manufacturers while maintaining the overall margins we receive from the Leads sold, our revenues will decrease. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to increase Lead revenues, prevent Dealer attrition or program terminations by Manufacturers or offset the revenues lost due to Dealer attrition or program terminations by Manufacturers by other means, and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may lose customers or quality Lead suppliers to our competitors.\nOur ability to provide increased numbers of high-quality Leads to our customers is dependent on increasing the number of Internally Generated Leads and acquiring high-quality Non-Internally Generated Leads from third parties. Originating Internally Generated Leads is dependent on our ability to increase consumer traffic to our Company Websites by providing secure and easy to use websites with relevant and quality content for consumers and increasing visibility of our brands to consumers and by our SEM activities. We compete for Dealer and Manufacturer customers and for acquisition of Non-Internally Generated Leads with companies that maintain automotive Lead referral businesses that are very similar to ours. Many of these competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources than we have. If we lose customers or quality Lead supply volume to our competitors, or if our pricing or cost to acquire Leads is adversely impacted, our financial performance will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on Manufacturers, through our third-party sales channel and direct-to-Manufacturer wholesale programs, for a significant amount of our revenues, and we may not be able to maintain or grow these relationships.\nWe depend on Manufacturers, through our third-party sales channel and direct-to-Manufacturer wholesale programs for a significant amount of our revenues. A decline in the level of advertising on our websites, reductions in advertising rates, terminations of their third-party Lead programs by Manufacturers or any significant failure to develop additional sources of advertising would cause our advertising revenues to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. We periodically negotiate revisions to existing agreements and these revisions could decrease our wholesale program revenues in future periods. A number of our third-party sales channel agreements and Manufacturer agreements may be terminated at any time without cause or upon expiration of the current term of the agreement. We may not be able to maintain our relationships with sales channel third parties or Manufacturers on favorable terms or find alternative comparable relationships capable of replacing revenues on terms satisfactory to us. If we cannot do so, our revenues would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nA reduction in the availability of, or access to, used vehicle inventory could adversely affect our business by increasing the costs of vehicles purchased and reducing the volume of units purchased for resale.\nOur Tradein Expert (dba CarZeus) operations acquire used vehicles primarily from individual consumers. There can be no assurance that sufficient inventory of used vehicles will continue to be available to Tradein Expert. or will be available at prices acceptable to Tradein Expert. Tradein Expert might have to absorb a portion of any cost increases in inventory without being able to pass those increases to vehicle purchasers. Any reduction in the availability of used vehicle inventory or increases in the cost of vehicles could adversely affect Tradein Expert\u2019s financial performance. Tradein Expert could have negative gross profit when the cost of inventory is greater than the resale price of that inventory. As a result of severely constrained new car inventories, there has been a significant increase in demand and prices for used vehicles\nThe retail used vehicle industry is fragmented and highly competitive, which could result in increased costs to acquire vehicles, lower sales prices due to competitive pressure.\nTradein Expert competes principally with (i) the used vehicle retail operations of franchised automobile dealerships, (ii) independent used vehicle dealers, some of which have significantly greater financial resources, and (iii) individuals who sell used vehicles in private transactions. Increased competition in the used vehicle market, including new entrants to the market, could result in increased costs for used vehicles and lower-than-expected vehicle sales and margins for Tradein Expert. Further, if Tradein Expert\u2019s competitors seek to gain or retain market share by increasing the prices they pay for used vehicles or reducing prices for used vehicles they sell, Tradein Expert may have to respond by increasing the prices it pays for vehicles or reducing the sales prices of used vehicles it sells to its customers in order to remain competitive, which may result in a decrease in Tradein Expert\u2019s sales and ability to achieve profitability.\nOur financial performance could be materially and adversely affected by changes in internet search engine algorithms, pricing or operational dynamics.\nWe use Google to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites, and, to a lesser extent, we use other search engines and meta-search websites to generate traffic to our websites, principally through pay-per-click advertising campaigns. The pricing and operating dynamics on these search engines can experience rapid change commercially, technically and competitively. For example, Google frequently updates and changes the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a consumer's search, such that the placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected and our costs to improve or maintain our placement in search results can increase. Our ability to continue to use Google could be impacted as a result of the Company\u2019s credit position. Our financial performance would be materially and adversely affected if we were no longer able to use Google for generation of traffic to our websites.\nWe are affected by general economic and market conditions, and, in particular, conditions in the automotive industry.\nOur financial performance is affected by general economic and market factors, conditions in the automotive industry, and the market for automotive marketing services, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf\nPricing and purchase incentives for vehicles;\n\u25cf\nAvailability and terms, including interest rates, of automotive financing;\n\u25cf\nThe expectation that consumers will be purchasing fewer vehicles overall during their lifetime as a result of better-quality vehicles and longer warranties;\n\u25cf\nThe impact of fuel prices, which increased significantly in the last year and into 2022 (most recently as a result of the impact of sanctions placed on Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine) and are expected to continue to increase, on demand for the number and types of vehicles;\n\u25cf\nIncreases or decreases in the number of retail Dealers or in the number of Manufacturers and other wholesale customers in our customer base;\n\u25cf\nVolatility in spending by Manufacturers and others in their marketing budgets and allocations;\n\u25cf\nThe competitive impact of consolidation in the online automotive consumer referral industry;\n\u25cf\nThe effect of changes in transportation policy, including the potential increase of public transportation options;\n\u25cf\nThe effect of fewer vehicles being purchased as a result of new business models and changes in consumer attitudes regarding the need for vehicle ownership;\n\u25cf\nThe impact of inflation, which has been increasing significantly, on consumer spending and consumer confidence;\n\u25cf\nDisruption in the automotive manufacturing and parts supply chains caused by natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics, adverse weather, incidents of civil unrest and other events may affect the supply of vehicle and parts inventories to Manufacturer\u2019s and Dealers; and\n\u25cf\nThe impact of high unemployment on the willingness or ability of consumers to acquire new or used vehicles.\nNatural disasters, public health crises, political crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control could damage our facilities or systems or the facilities or systems of third parties on which we depend on, adversely impact and cause disruptions in supply chains or vehicle inventory and could adversely impact consumer confidence and spending.\nIf any of our facilities or the facilities of our third-party service or Lead providers are affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires, power shortages, floods, public health crises (such as pandemics and epidemics), political crises (such as terrorism, insurrection, war, political instability or other conflict) or other events outside our control, including a cyberattack, our critical business or IT systems could be destroyed or disrupted and our ability to conduct normal business operations, and our financial performance, could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact Dealers, Manufacturers and consumer confidence and spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally, which could adversely impact our financial performance.\nIn early 2020 and continuing as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the outbreak of coronavirus and emerging variants has led to quarantines, mask mandates, vaccination requirements and stay-at-home/work-from-home orders in a number of countries, states, cities and regions and the closure or limited or restricted access to public and private offices, businesses and facilities, causing widespread disruptions to travel, economic activity, supply chains and financial markets. The continuing effect of the coronavirus pandemic has led our Manufacturer and Dealer customers to experience disruptions in the supply of vehicle and parts inventories, and in the overall health, safety and availability of their labor force. Manufacturers have also shut down assembly plants, adversely impacting inventories of new vehicles. Volatility in the financial markets, concerns about exposure to the virus, governmental quarantines, mask mandates, vaccination requirements, stay-at-home/work-from-home orders, business closures and employment furloughs and layoffs have also impacted consumer confidence and spending. Lower consumer confidence may continue even after quarantines, mask mandates, vaccination requirements, stay-at-home/work-from-home orders and business closures have ended. These disruptions have impacted the willingness or desire of our customers to acquire vehicle Leads or other digital marketing services from us. We are also experiencing direct disruptions in our operations due to the overall health and safety of, and concerns for, our labor force and as a result of governmental \u201csocial distancing\u201d programs, quarantines, mask mandates, vaccination requirements and stay-at-home/work-from-home orders, leading us to reduce or restrict access to our offices and allowing employees to work remotely from their homes.\nIn addition to the continued impact of the coronavirus pandemic on supply chains and vehicle inventories and sales, Manufacturers have also experienced significant disruption in the supply of semiconductor chips required for new vehicles due to a worldwide shortage of these chips. As a result, the ability of Manufacturers to maintain regular production output of certain vehicles, and the corresponding reduction in available new vehicle inventories, have adversely impacted new vehicle sales and increased demand for used vehicles. Further disrupting the automotive industry and the number of vehicles available for sale or lease are disruptions in the supply of other components used in vehicle manufacturing.\nWe are unable to predict the continuing extent, duration and impact of the supply chain disruptions on the automotive industry in general, and on our business and operations specifically. The spread of coronavirus variants and governmental responses thereto may prolong or increase the negative impacts of the pandemic. Vehicle sales have declined, and we continue to experience cancellations or suspensions of purchases of Leads and other digital marketing services by our customers, which could continue to materially and adversely affect our financial performance. In light of the continuing impact of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions, we have continued taking steps to reduce our overall Lead and click generation efforts and corresponding costs to better align our volumes with industry demand and consumer intent and ability to purchase or lease vehicles. We will continue to evaluate these and other cost reduction measures, and explore all options available to us, in order to minimize the impact of these events on us.\nIf we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract, train and retain additional highly qualified executive, sales, marketing, managerial and technical personnel, our financial performance may be adversely impacted.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly-qualified executive, sales, marketing, managerial and technical personnel. In addition, as we introduce new services, we may need to hire additional personnel. We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. The inability to attract and retain the necessary highly qualified executive, managerial, technical, sales and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and other key employees. Each of these executive officers and other key employees could be difficult to replace. There is no guarantee that any of our executive officers or other key employees will remain employed with us. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nQualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide competitive compensation packages, including cash and stock-based compensation. Our primary forms of stock-based incentive awards are stock options and restricted stock. If the anticipated value of such stock-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our stock-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees could be adversely impacted.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with overseas operations.\nWe currently maintain website, software development and other operations in Guatemala and may contract with third party service providers that provide services to us through their overseas operations. These overseas operations are subject to many inherent risks, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nPolitical and social instability;\n\u25cf\nExposure to different business practices and legal standards, particularly with respect to labor and employment laws and intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nContinuation of overseas conflicts and the risk of terrorist attacks and resulting heightened security;\n\u25cf\nThe imposition of governmental controls and restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nTheft and other crimes;\n\u25cf\nNationalization of business and blocking of cash flows;\n\u25cf\nChanges in taxation and tariffs;\n\u25cf\nDifficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n\u25cf\nForeign currency exchange fluctuations.\nThese risks can significantly impact our overseas operations and outsourcing. Increases in the cost, or disruptions, of such operations and outsourcing, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we are subject to certain anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. If we or any of our employees or agents violates these laws, we could become subject to sanctions or significant penalties that could negatively affect our reputation and financial performance.\nWe may acquire other businesses, products or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention from our business, disrupt our operations and materially and adversely impact our financial performance.\nAs part of our strategy to grow our business, we evaluate whether to acquire other businesses, products or technologies that we believe will complement or enhance our existing business rather than develop these internally. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or to complete identified acquisitions. The integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes successfully. We cannot provide any assurances that any completed acquisitions will be successful.\nIn order to complete acquisitions, we may issue common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders. Issuance of equity securities may also restrict utilization of net operating loss carryforwards because of an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. We may also borrow to finance acquisitions, and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisition-related or other borrowings may not be favorable to the Company and could affect our financial performance. An announced acquisition transaction may not close timely or at all, which may cause our financial performance to differ from expectations in a given period.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks that include the following, any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance:\n\u25cf\nWe may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or may not realize them in the timeframe expected, including due to acquisitions where we expand into product and service offerings or enter or expand into markets in which we are not experienced;\n\u25cf\nWe may be required to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which would result in significant ongoing operating expenses and could divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business;\n\u25cf\nAcquisitions may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans;\n\u25cf\nOur due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with an acquired company that may result in unexpected or increased costs, expenses or liabilities that could make an acquisition less profitable or unprofitable;\n\u25cf\nThe failure to further our strategic objectives through acquisitions may require us to expend additional resources to develop products, services and technology internally;\n\u25cf\nAcquisitions may lead to litigation that can be costly to defend or settle, even if no actual liability exists;\n\u25cf\nIntegrations of acquisitions are often complex, time consuming and expensive, and if acquisitions are not successfully integrated, they could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. The challenges involved with integration of acquisitions include:\no\nDiversion of management attention to assimilating the acquired business from other business operations and concerns;\no\nIntegration of the acquired business\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources, legal and other administrative systems into our systems;\no\nDifficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our own business;\no\nConvincing our customers and suppliers and the customers and suppliers of the acquired business that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus and that they should not defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers;\no\nConsolidating and rationalizing corporate IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes;\no\nPersuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale, retaining key employees and integrating employees into the Company;\no\nCoordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, technology, research and development, sales and marketing and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and relationships;\no\nTransition of the acquired business\u2019s users to our websites and mobile applications;\no\nTransition of customers to our products and services and our contracts;\no\nRisks associated with the businesses, products or technologies we acquired, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our business faces;\no\nLiability for the activities, products or services of the business we acquired, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;\no\nLitigation or other claims in connection with the business, product or technology we acquired, including claims from terminated employees, consumers, former stockholders or other third parties; and\no\nThe need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures and policies.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for certain support services and should they fail to perform, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on various third parties from which we acquire Leads, clicks, or consumer traffic for resale to our customers and to provide certain support services. Should a third party fail to perform or perform adequately, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent on keeping pace with advances in technology. If we are unable to keep pace with advances in technology, consumers may stop using our services and our revenues will decrease. Our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected by material investments in technology.\nThe internet and electronic commerce markets are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user and customer requirements, frequent new service and product introductions embodying new technologies, including mobile internet applications, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing websites and technology obsolete. These market characteristics are intensified by the evolving nature of the market and the fact that companies are expected to introduce new internet products and services on a regular basis. If we are unable to adapt to changing technologies, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. Our performance will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing services, develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers, license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of our websites, mobile applications and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our websites or other proprietary technology to customer requirements or to emerging industry standards. In addition, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected by material investments in technology in order to keep pace with technological advances.\nInterruptions or failures in our information technology platforms, communication systems or security systems could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur information technology and communications systems are susceptible to outages and interruptions due to fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyberattacks, terrorist attacks, technology operations and development failures, failure of redundant systems and disaster recovery plans and similar events. Such outages and interruptions could damage our reputation and materially and adversely impact our financial performance. Despite our network security measures, our information technology platforms are vulnerable to computer viruses, worms, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage, malware attacks, insider threats and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering, as well as coordinated denial-of-service attacks. We do not have multiple site capacity for all of our services. In the event of delays or disruptions to services we rely on third-party providers to perform disaster recovery planning and services on our behalf. We are vulnerable to extended failures to the extent that planning and services are not adequate to meet our continued technology platform, communication or security systems\u2019 needs. We rely on third-party providers for our primary and secondary internet connections. Our co-location service and public cloud services that provide infrastructure and platform services, environmental and power support for our technology platforms, communication systems and security systems are received from third-party providers. We have little or no control over these third-party providers. Any disruption of the services they provide us or any failure of these third-party providers to effectively design and implement sufficient security systems or plan for increases in capacity could, in turn, cause delays or disruptions in our services. We are insured for some, but not all, of these events. Even for those events for which we are insured and have coverage under the terms and conditions of the applicable policies, there are no assurances given that the coverage limits would be sufficient to cover all losses we might incur or experience. We have recently conducted evaluations of our technology and business systems, and based on these evaluations, we believe that our technology infrastructure, our accounting and business systems and disaster recovery procedures are in need of upgrades and replacements. Failure to implement these updates and upgrades could result in systems failures, inability to promptly recover from system failures, and data security risks. We anticipate incurring significant expenses in upgrading and replacing technology infrastructure and business systems over the next three years. Our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected by material investments in new technology infrastructure and business systems.\nFinancial, Accounting and Liquidity Risks\nConcentration of credit risk and risks due to significant customers could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with one financial institution in the United States. Deposits held by banks exceed the amount of insurance provided for such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand. Accounts receivable are primarily derived from fees billed to Dealers and Manufacturers. We have a concentration of credit risk with our automotive industry related accounts receivable balances, particularly with Carat Detroit (General Motors), Urban Science Applications (which represents several Manufacturer programs), Autodata Solutions and Shift Digital. During 2021, approximately 43%, or $30.9 million of our total revenues and approximately 64% or $7.3 million of gross accounts receivable were related to these four customers at December 31, 2021. No collateral is required to support our accounts receivables, and we maintain an allowance for bad debts for potential credit losses. If there is a decline in the general economic environment or other factors that negatively affects the financial condition of our customers or an increase in the number of customers that are dissatisfied with our services, additional estimated allowances for bad debts and customer credits may be required, and the adverse impact on our financial performance could be material.\nIf we are unable to generate positive cash flows, we may not be able to continue operations unless we are able to obtain additional cash through private or public sales of securities, debt financings or partnering/licensing transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7.3 million and restricted cash of $4.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $5.7 million and had net cash used in operations of $0.9 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $355.4 million and stockholders\u2019 equity of $12.8 million. Although we have developed a strategic plan with the objective to achieve cash generation as a business, if we are unsuccessful in achieving this objective, we may need to seek to satisfy our future cash needs through private or public sales of securities, debt financings or partnering/licensing transactions; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in satisfying our future cash needs such that we will be able to continue operations. If we continue to experience losses and cannot comply with the covenants in our Loan, Security and Guarantee Agreement dated as of March 26, 2020, as amended, with CIT Northbridge Credit LLC, as agent, (\u201cCNC Credit Agreement\u201d) or if our borrowing base limits are diminished, we may not be able to borrow sufficient funds under CNC Credit Agreement to satisfy our future cash needs.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to implement new strategic plans, modernize and upgrade our technology and systems, pursue business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to, implementing new strategic plans, modernizing and upgrading our technology and systems, pursuing business objectives and responding to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, developing new or improving existing products or services, enhancing our operating infrastructure and acquiring complementary businesses and technologies. In addition, if we continue to experience losses and cannot comply with covenants in the CNC Credit Agreement or if our borrowing base limits are diminished, we may be unable to borrow sufficient funds under the CNC Credit Agreement to satisfy our future cash needs. Although we have developed a strategic plan with the objective to achieve cash generation as a business, if our plans are unsuccessful, we may need to seek to satisfy our future cash needs through private or public sales of securities, debt financings or partnering/licensing transactions; however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in satisfying our future cash needs such that we will be able to continue operations.\nWe will require additional capital to implement new strategic plans, modernize and upgrade our technology and systems, pursue business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including to develop new products or services, improve existing products and services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. As a result, we expect that we will need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. If capital is not available to us, or is not available to us on favorable terms, our financial performance would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe CNC Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital, as could any additional debt financing that we may secure in the future that could involve additional restrictive covenants. Volatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to implement new strategic plans, modernize and upgrade our technology and systems, pursue business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. The CNC Credit Agreement expires in March 2023.\nIf our internal controls and procedures fail, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.\nPursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls over financial reporting are processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As a smaller reporting company (as defined by the SEC), we are not required to obtain a separate attestation of our internal control over financial reporting from our independent auditors. Our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis could be adversely affected by a failure in our internal control over financial reporting. If our financial statements are not fairly presented, investors may not have an accurate understanding of our operating results and financial condition. If our financial statements are not timely filed with the SEC, we could be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market. If either or both of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, a failure in our internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur internal controls may not prevent all potential errors or fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. We, or our independent registered public accountants, may identify material weaknesses in our internal controls which could adversely affect our ability to ensure proper financial reporting and could affect investor confidence in us and the price of our common shares.\nPersonal Information and Data Security and Privacy Risks\nOur business is subject to various laws, rules and regulations relating to data security and privacy. New data security and privacy laws, rules and regulations may be adopted regarding the internet or other online services that could limit our business flexibility or cause us to incur higher compliance costs. In each case, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. Identified below are some of these risks that we believe could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe failure to comply with privacy laws could materially and adversely impact our financial performance.\nVarious laws, rules and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sale, disclosure, sharing and security of data and personal information that we receive from consumers, customers, advertisers and Lead referral and advertising affiliates. In addition, we have and post on our website our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use, retention, sale, disclosure, sharing and security of user data and personal information. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders or other federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Further, failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies, applicable requirements or industry self-regulatory principles related to the collection, use, retention, sale, disclosure, sharing and security of data and personal information or other privacy-related matters could result in a loss of user confidence in us, damage to our brands, and ultimately in a loss of consumers, customers, advertisers or Lead referral and advertising affiliates. We cannot predict whether new legislation or regulations concerning privacy and data security issues related to our business will be adopted, or if adopted, whether they could impose requirements that may result in a decrease in our Lead referrals and materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Proposals that have or are currently being considered include restrictions relating to the collection, use, retention, sale, disclosure, sharing and security of data and personal information obtained through the tracking of internet use, including the possible implementation of a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d list, that would allow internet users to opt-out of such tracking. Other proposals include enhanced rights for consumers to obtain information regarding the sharing or sale of their personal information and rights to opt-out or prevent the sharing or sale of their personal information to third parties, similar to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. The State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), that includes significant personal information privacy rights for consumers, including rights to know about the personal information collected and sold by a business, have a consumer\u2019s personal information deleted, and to opt-out of any sales of the consumer\u2019s personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. In addition, in November 2020, voters in California approved Proposition 24, which enacted the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (\u201cCPRA\u201d). This act includes various amendments to the CCPA and expansion of rights thereunder and creates a new California Privacy Protection Agency with full administrative power, authority and jurisdiction to implement and enforce the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA. Other states have enacted data privacy legislation and other states may do so in the future. Compliance with these laws, could have a material and adverse effect on our financial performance. The CCPA, as amended, and regulations promulgated thereunder may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Modifications to our data processing practices and policies, products and consumer experience that we have made and may need to make to comply with the CCPA, as amended, and similar legislation, or that we may be required to make in the future as a result of the continuing changes to the requirements under that legislation or similar future legislation, may materially negatively impact our financial performance.\nRisks associated with telemarketing and advertising.\nWe and our third-party Lead suppliers are subject to various federal and state laws, rules, regulations and orders regarding telemarketing and privacy, including restrictions on the use of unsolicited emails and restrictions on marketing activities conducted through the use of telephonic communications (including text messaging to mobile telephones). Our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected by newly-adopted or amended laws, rules, regulations and orders relating to telemarketing and increased enforcement of such laws, rules, regulations or orders by governmental agencies or by private litigants. The regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d) require the prior express written consent of the called party before a caller can initiate telemarketing calls (i) to wireless numbers (including text messaging) using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice; or (ii) to residential lines using an artificial or prerecorded voice. Failure to comply with the TCPA can result in significant penalties, including statutory damages. We may become subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits) alleging that our business violated the TCPA. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. Such litigation, even if not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and an adverse outcome could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Our efforts to comply with these regulations may negatively affect conversion rates of Leads, and thus, our revenue or profitability.\nData security risks.\nA significant issue for online businesses like ours is the secure transmission of confidential and personal information over public networks and data security of retained confidential and personal information. Concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy issues have been significant issues impacting the growth in consumer use of the internet, online advertising and e-commerce. Despite our implementation of security detection, prevention and monitoring measures, our computer systems or those of our vendors are susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptive harms and security breaches. For example, in early 2020 we discovered that our network was impacted by malware that encrypted servers on most systems and disrupted consumer and customer access to many of our services, although we did not discover any evidence that caused us to conclude that there has been any unauthorized access to or acquisition of any consumer personal information or customer confidential information. In addition, consumers may experience losses of personally identifiable information as a result of corporate identity theft. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may specifically compromise our security measures. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures on a timely basis. Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information that we collect or store, whether through breach of our network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our reputation and brands, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain our audiences, or subject us to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers or Lead or traffic suppliers. If consumers experience identity theft related to personally identifiable information we collect or store, we may be exposed to liability, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation. To the extent that unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information or corporate identity theft gives rise to reluctance to use our websites or to supply us leads or traffic, or a decline in consumer confidence in financial transactions over the internet, our business could be adversely affected. Alleged or actual breaches of the network of one of our business partners or competitors whom consumers associate with us could also harm our reputation and brands. In addition, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information, including states that have enacted laws requiring companies to inform individuals of any security breaches that result in their personal information being stolen. Because our success depends on the acceptance of online services and e-commerce, we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by those breaches. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, and we may need to expend significant resources in protecting against or remediating security breaches and cyberattacks.\nWe are insured for some, but not all, of the foregoing risks. Even for those risks for which we are insured and have coverage under the terms and conditions of the applicable policies, there are no assurances given that the coverage limits would be sufficient to cover all costs, liabilities or losses we might incur or experience.\nOnline fraud and scams.\nInternet fraud has been increasing over the past few years, and we have experienced fraudulent use of our name and trademarks on websites in connection with the purported sale of vehicles offered on third-party websites, with payments to be handled through an online escrow service purported to be owned and operated by us. These fraudulent online transactions and scams, should they continue to increase in prevalence, could affect our reputation with consumers and give rise to claims by consumers for funds transferred to the fraudulent accounts, which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nAnti-spam laws, rules, and regulations.\nVarious state and federal laws, rules and regulations regulate email communications and internet advertising and restrict or prohibit unsolicited email (commonly known as \u201cspam\u201d). These laws, rules or regulations may adversely affect our ability to market our services to consumers in a cost-effective manner. The federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (\u201cCAN-SPAM\u201d) imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with sending commercial emails. In addition, state laws regulating the sending of commercial emails, including California\u2019s law regulating the sending of commercial emails, to the extent found to not be preempted by CAN-SPAM, may impose requirements or conditions more restrictive than CAN-SPAM. Violation of these laws, rules or regulations may result in monetary fines or penalties or damage to our reputation.\n-\nRisks Associated with Regulatory Matters\nUncertainty exists in the application of various laws and regulations to our business. New laws or regulations applicable to our business, or expansion or interpretation of existing laws and regulations to apply to our business, could subject us to licensing, claims, judgments and remedies, including civil and criminal penalties and limitations on our business practices, and could increase administrative costs or materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in a regulatory climate in which there is uncertainty as to the application of various laws and regulations to our business. Our business could be significantly affected by different interpretations or applications of existing laws or regulations, future laws or regulations, or actions or rulings by judicial or regulatory authorities. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to obtain licenses at an undeterminable and possibly significant initial and annual expense that could decrease the popularity or impede the expansion of e-commerce and internet marketing, restrict our present business practices, require us to implement costly compliance procedures or expose us and/or our customers to potential civil or criminal liability.\nWe may be deemed to \u201coperate\u201d or \u201cdo business\u201d in states where our customers conduct their business, resulting in regulatory action. If any state licensing laws were determined to be applicable to us, and if we are required to be licensed and we are unable to do so, or we are otherwise unable to comply with laws or regulations, we could be subject to fines or other penalties or be compelled to discontinue operations in those states. In the event any state\u2019s regulatory requirements impose state-specific requirements on us or include us within an industry-specific regulatory scheme, we may be required to modify our digital marketing programs in that state in a manner that may undermine the program\u2019s attractiveness to consumers or Dealers. In the alternative, if we determine that the licensing and related requirements are overly burdensome, we may elect not to operate in, or to terminate operations in, that state. In each case, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe following description of laws and regulations to which we may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to continuous change. The enactment of new laws and regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations in an unfavorable way may affect the operation of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenues, increased expenses and decreased profitability.\nAutomotive Dealer/ Broker and Vehicle Advertising Laws.\nAll states comprehensively regulate vehicle sales and lease transactions, including strict licensure requirements for automotive dealers (and, in some states, automotive brokers) and vehicle advertising. We do not sell motor vehicles in any state, except for Tradein Expert, our used vehicle acquisition and selling service that is licensed as a motor vehicle dealer in the State of Texas. State regulatory authorities or third parties could take the position that some of the regulations applicable to dealers or to the manner in which motor vehicles are advertised and sold generally are directly applicable to our digital marketing and consumer referrals business. We believe that most of these laws and regulations specifically address only traditional vehicle purchase and lease transactions, not internet-based digital marketing and consumer referral programs such as our programs. If we determine that the licensing or other regulatory requirements in a given state are applicable to our digital marketing and consumer referrals business or to a particular marketing services program, we may elect to obtain required licenses and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. However, if licensing or other regulatory requirements are overly burdensome, we may elect to terminate operations or particular marketing services programs in that state, elect to not operate or introduce particular marketing services programs in that state or modify the service to comply with applicable law without being subjected to licensing requirements. In some states we have modified our marketing programs or pricing models to reduce uncertainty regarding our compliance with local laws.\nWith regard to our vehicle acquisition and resale business, we are subject to the motor vehicle dealer licensing and other related laws and regulations in the State of Texas, as well as changes in these laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied. The violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our vehicle acquisition and resale business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) has authority to take actions to remedy or prevent advertising practices that it considers to be unfair or deceptive and that affect commerce in the United States. In addition to generally applicable consumer protection laws, many states in which we do business have laws and regulations that specifically regulate the advertising for sale of new or used motor vehicles. These state advertising laws and regulations are frequently subject to multiple interpretations and are not uniform from state to state, sometimes imposing inconsistent requirements on the advertiser of a new or used motor vehicle.\n-\nSome states in which we do business have laws and regulations that strictly regulate or prohibit the brokering of motor vehicles or the making of so-called \u201cbird-dog\u201d payments by dealers to third parties in connection with the sale of motor vehicles through persons other than licensed salespersons. If our products or services are determined to fall within the scope of those laws or regulations, we may be forced to implement new measures, which could be costly, to reduce our exposure to those obligations, including the discontinuation of certain products or services in affected jurisdictions.\nIf our products or services are determined not to comply with relevant licensing, advertising or other regulatory requirements, we could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation, as well as orders interfering with our ability to continue providing our products and services in some or all states. In addition, even without a determination that our products or services do not comply with relevant regulatory requirements, if customers are uncertain about the applicability of those laws and regulations to our business, we may be subjected to adverse publicity and lose, or have difficulty increasing the number of, customers for our products and services, which could adversely affect our future growth and materially and adversely impact our financial performance.\nFinancial Broker and Consumer Credit Laws.\nThrough our websites, consumers can click through to Dealer, Manufacturer and potential lender websites to obtain information regarding automotive financing. All online applications for financing quotes are completed on the respective third party\u2019s websites. We receive marketing fees from financial institutions and Dealers in connection with this marketing activity. We do not demand, nor do we receive any fees from consumers for these services. In the event states require us to be licensed as a financial broker or finder, we may be unable to comply with a state\u2019s laws or regulations, or we could be required to incur significant fees and expenses to obtain any required financial broker or finder license and comply with regulatory requirements. In addition, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad regulatory powers, which could lead to regulation of our advertising business directly or indirectly through regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions. California has enacted the California Consumer Financial Protection Law that significantly expanded the regulatory and enforcement authority of the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Other states may expand or create new state level consumer financial protection agencies that could lead to increased regulation of our business.\nIf our products or services are determined not to comply with relevant financial broker or consumer credit licensing or other regulatory requirements, we could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation, as well as orders interfering with our ability to continue providing our products and services in some or all states. In addition, even without a determination that our products or services do not comply with relevant regulatory requirements, if customers are uncertain about the applicability of those laws and regulations to our business, we may be subjected to adverse publicity and lose, or have difficulty increasing the number of, customers for our products and services, which could adversely affect our future growth and materially and adversely impact our financial performance.\nInsurance Broker Laws. We provide links on our websites and referrals from call centers enabling consumers to be referred to third parties to receive quotes for automobile insurance and other products or services, including vehicle service contracts, that may be deemed to be insurance under applicable state laws. All online applications for quotes are completed on the respective insurance carriers\u2019 or other third-party websites, and all applications for quotes obtained through call center referrals are conducted by the insurance carrier or other third party. We receive marketing fees from participants in connection with this marketing activity. We do not receive any premiums from consumers nor do we charge consumers fees for our services. In the event states require us to be licensed under applicable insurance brokering or sales laws, we may be unable to comply with a state\u2019s laws or regulations, or we could be required to incur significant fees and expenses to obtain required licenses and comply with regulatory requirements.\nIf our products or services are determined not to comply with relevant insurance brokering or sales licensing or other regulatory requirements, we could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation, as well as orders interfering with our ability to continue providing our products and services in some or all states. In addition, even without a determination that our products or services do not comply with relevant regulatory requirements, if customers are uncertain about the applicability of those laws and regulations to our business, we may be subjected to adverse publicity and lose, or have difficulty increasing the number of, customers for our products and services, which could adversely affect our future growth and materially and adversely impact our financial performance.\n-\nRisks Associated with Tax Matters\nChanges in the taxation of internet commerce may result in increased costs.\nBecause our business is dependent on the internet, the adoption of new local, state or federal tax laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations by governmental authorities may subject us to additional local, state or federal sales, use or income taxes and could decrease the growth of internet usage or marketing or the acceptance of internet commerce which could, in turn, decrease the demand for our services and increase our costs. As a result, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. State taxing authorities are reviewing and re-evaluating the tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce, including the application of sales taxes to internet marketing businesses similar to ours, as a source of tax revenues. We accrue for tax contingencies based upon our estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid, which we update over time as more information becomes available, new legislation or rules are adopted or taxing authorities interpret their existing statutes and rules to apply to internet commerce, including internet marketing businesses similar to ours. The amounts ultimately paid in resolution of reviews or audits by taxing authorities could differ materially from the amounts we have accrued and result in additional tax expense, and our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes is limited, we may not receive the benefit of those assets.\nWe had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $110.7 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $55.7 million at December 31, 2021. These federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in the years ending December 31, 2025 and 2028, respectively. Federal net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017, will not expire and will carry forward indefinitely, but will be limited in any given year to offsetting a maximum of 80% of our taxable income for the year, determined without regard to the application of such net operating loss carryforwards.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code impose substantial restrictions on the use of net operating losses and other tax attributes in the event of a cumulative \u201cownership change\u201d of a corporation of more than 50% over a three-year period. Accordingly, if we generate taxable income in the future, changes in our stock ownership, including equity offerings, as well as other changes that may be outside our control, could potentially result in material limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards.\nRisks Associated with Ownership of Our Securities\nThe public market for our common stock may be volatile, especially because market prices for internet-related and technology stocks have often been unrelated to operating performance.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cAUTO,\u201d but we cannot assure that an active trading market will be sustained or that the market price of the common stock will not decline. The stock market in general periodically experiences significant price fluctuations. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following:\n\u25cf\nActual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nHistorical and anticipated operating metrics such as the number of participating Dealers, volume of Lead deliveries to Dealers, the number of visitors to Company Websites and the frequency with which they interact with Company Websites;\n\u25cf\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of new product or service offerings;\n\u25cf\nAnnounced or completed acquisitions of or investments in businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nActual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u25cf\nLow trading volumes;\n\u25cf\nConcentration of holdings in our common stock resulting in low public float and trading volume for our shares;\n\u25cf\nDecisions by holders of large blocks of our stock to sell their holdings on accelerated time schedules, including by reason of their decision to liquidate investment funds that hold our stock;\n\u25cf\nCompetitive developments, including actions by Manufacturers;\n\u25cf\nData or network security incidents and breaches;\n\u25cf\nLoan covenant defaults;\n-\n\u25cf\nNew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf\nLitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nConditions and trends in the internet, electronic commerce and automotive industries;\n\u25cf\nChanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles affecting the technology or automotive industry;\n\u25cf\nRumors, whether or not accurate, about us, our industry, our competitors or possible transactions or other events;\n\u25cf\nAny significant change in our management;\n\u25cf\nReaction by certain market participants to the activities of other market participants, such as large short positions on our stock;\n\u25cf\nThe impact of open market repurchases of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nComments posted on internet discussion sites; and\n\u25cf\nGeneral market or economic conditions and other factors.\nFurther, the stock markets in general, including the market for automotive marketing services companies like us, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market factors have affected and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes, inflation, energy price changes, epidemics and pandemics, international currency fluctuations, terrorist acts, insurrections, political revolutions, military actions or wars, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies with publicly traded securities.\nOur common stock could be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we are not able to satisfy continued listing requirements, in which case the price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital and issue equity-based compensation may be adversely affected, and trading in our stock may be less orderly and efficient.\nFor our common stock to continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, we must satisfy various continued listing requirements established by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. In the event we are not able to satisfy these continued listing requirements, we expect that our common stock would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. These markets are generally considered to be less efficient and less broad than The Nasdaq Capital Market. Investors may be reluctant to invest in the common stock if it is not listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market or another stock exchange. Delisting of our common stock could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and would also eliminate our ability to rely on the preemption of state securities registration and qualification requirements afforded by Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1933 for \u201ccovered securities.\u201d The loss of this preemption could result in higher costs associated with raising capital, could limit resale of our stock in some states, and could adversely impact our ability to issue equity-based compensation to our employees.\nOne of the continued listing requirements is that our Common Stock not trade below a minimum closing bid requirement of $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days. Should our Common Stock trade below the $1.00 minimum closing bid requirement for 30 business days, Nasdaq would send us a deficiency notice, advising that it is being afforded a compliance period of 180 days to regain compliance with the requirement. This 180-day compliance period may be extended by Nasdaq for another 180 days, subject to certain conditions being satisfied, including that we meet other continued listing requirements and provides a written notice to Nasdaq that we intend to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid requirement during the extended period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nNo assurances can be given that we will continue to be able to meet the continued listing requirements for listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, tax benefit preservation plan and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and could discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us or limit the price third parties are willing to pay for our stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws relating to our corporate governance and provisions in our Tax Benefit Preservation Plan could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us and could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of the common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation allows us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that the Board of Directors is divided into three classes, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or change in our management because less than a majority of the Board of Directors are up for election at each annual meeting, and as a result of the classified board the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) provides that directors may only be removed for cause. In addition, provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u25cf\nCreate a classified Board of Directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u25cf\nRequire that actions to be taken by our stockholders may be taken only at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u25cf\nAuthorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u25cf\nSpecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, a committee of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of our Board of Directors or our President;\n\u25cf\nEstablish advance notice procedures for stockholders to submit nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors and other proposals to be brought before a stockholders meeting;\n\u25cf\nProvide that our bylaws may be amended by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf\nAllow our Board of Directors to establish the size of our Board of Directors;\n\u25cf\nProvide that vacancies on our Board of Directors or newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of our directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u25cf\nDo not give the holders of our common stock cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors.\nUnder our Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, rights to purchase capital stock of the Company (\u201cRights\u201d) have been distributed as a dividend at the rate of five Rights for each share of common stock. Each Right entitles its holder, upon triggering of the Rights, to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company at a price of $20.00 (as this price may be adjusted under the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan) or, in certain circumstances, to instead acquire shares of common stock. The Rights will convert into a right to acquire common stock or other capital stock of the Company in certain circumstances and subject to certain exceptions. The Rights will be triggered upon the acquisition of 4.90% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock or future acquisitions by any existing holders of 4.90% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. If a person or group acquires 4.90% or more of our common stock, all Rights holders, except the acquirer, will be entitled to acquire at the then exercise price of a Right that number of shares of our common stock which, at the time, has a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to exercise discretionary authority to deem a person acquiring common stock in excess of 4.90% not to be an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d under the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, and thereby not trigger the Rights, if the Board finds that the beneficial ownership of the shares by the person acquiring the shares will not be likely to directly or indirectly limit the availability to the Company of the net operating loss carryovers and other tax attributes that the plan is intended to preserve or is otherwise in the best interests of the Company.\nWe are also subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which, in general, prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. For purposes of Section 203, a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder, and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or did own 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. Section 203 could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, our Tax Benefit Preservation Plan or of Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we otherwise agree, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for:\n\u25cf\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u25cf\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u25cf\nany action asserting a claim against us under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; and\n\u25cf\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis exclusive-forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or other agents, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and other agents. If a court were to find this exclusive-forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have provided and may continue to provide guidance about our business and future operating results as part of our press releases, investor conference calls or otherwise. In developing this guidance, our management must make significant assumptions and judgments about our future performance. Our future business results may vary significantly from management\u2019s guidance due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. If our publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet the expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our common stock could decline.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers and directors, their affiliates and holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of April 23, 2021, our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock (based upon the most recent filings on Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G with the SEC with respect to each such holder) beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 41% of our outstanding shares of common stock (assuming exercise of all beneficially owned shares represented by stock options or warrants exercisable within sixty days of the record date for our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders). Some of these persons or entities may have interests that are different from yours. For example, these stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree, or which are not in your interests. These stockholders are able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders, which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIf we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of the securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors in the past, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid in the past. In addition, if we were to issue securities in connection with our acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies, our stockholders would also experience dilution. In November 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which may be used to raise additional capital in the future through a variety of equity or debt offerings that could result in dilution to existing stockholders. In addition, we have reserved shares for issuance under our equity-based incentive plans. The issuance and subsequent sale of these shares will be dilutive to our existing stockholders and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could decline. If any analyst who covers us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our credit facility currently restrict our payment of cash dividends on our capital stock. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nRisks Associated with Litigation\nMisappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, enforcement actions to protect our intellectual property and claims from third parties relating to intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nLitigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and technology industries. We expect that internet technologies and software products and services may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Our proprietary systems and technology are a competitive factor. While we rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright law, confidentiality agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights, we believe that the technical and creative skills of our personnel, continued development of our proprietary systems and technology, brand-name recognition and reliable website maintenance are more essential in establishing and maintaining a leadership position and strengthening our brands. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult and may be expensive. We have no assurance that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable. Effective trademark, service mark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available when our products and services are made available online. In addition, if litigation becomes necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, this litigation, even if successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. We also have no assurances that our products and services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Claims of infringement, even if unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. If we are not successful, we may be subject to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and monetary damages which may be trebled in the case willful infringements.\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected by actions of third parties that could subject us to litigation.\nWe could face liability for information retrieved or obtained from or transmitted over the internet by third parties and liability for products sold over the internet by third parties. We could be exposed to liability with respect to third-party information that may be accessible through our websites, links or vehicle review services. These claims might, for example, be made for defamation, negligence, patent, copyright or trademark infringement, personal injury, breach of contract, unfair competition, false advertising, invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature, content or copying of these materials. These claims might assert, among other things that, by directly or indirectly providing links to websites operated by third parties we should be liable for copyright or trademark infringement or other wrongful actions by such third parties through those websites. It is also possible that, if any third-party content provided on our websites contains errors, consumers could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on such information. Any claims could result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, cause delays in releasing new or upgrading existing services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nWe also enter into agreements with other companies under which any revenues that results from the purchase or use of services through direct links to or from our websites or on our websites is shared. In addition, we acquire personal information and data in the form of Leads purchased from third-party websites involving consumers who submitted personally identifiable information and data to the third parties and not directly to us. These arrangements may expose us to additional legal risks and uncertainties, including disputes with these parties regarding revenue sharing, local, state and federal government regulation and potential liabilities to consumers of these services, even if we do not provide the services ourselves or have direct contact with the consumer. These liabilities can include liability for violations by these third parties of laws, rules and regulations, including those related to data security and privacy laws and regulations; unsolicited email, text messaging, telephone or wireless voice marketing; and licensing. We have no assurance that any indemnification provided to us in our agreements with these third parties, if available, will be adequate.\nOur financial performance could be materially and adversely affected by other litigation.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation or legal matters not related to intellectual property rights and arising from the normal course of our business activities. The actions filed against us and other litigation or legal matters, even if not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and an adverse outcome in litigation could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Our liability insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.", "PERMNO": 86763, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AUTO"}
