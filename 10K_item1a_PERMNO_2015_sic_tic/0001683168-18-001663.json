RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below with respect to an investment in our shares. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash provided by operations could be materially harmed. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. When evaluating an investment in our common stock, you should also refer to the other information in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Relating to Our Recycling Business and Our Business Generally\nOur revenues, earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices.\nOur recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials, including steel, aluminum and copper, all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations. The majority of the recyclables we process for sale are steel and non-ferrous metals. The fluctuations in the market prices or demand for such commodity items, particularly demand from China and Turkey, can affect our future operating income and cash flows negatively, such as we experienced in 2015 and 2014. As we have increased the size of our recycling operations, we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations.\nIn the past we have also earned a significant amount of revenue from the sale of carbon credits under the California Cap-and-Trade Program. The creation of carbon offsets involves a consultant's establishment of a project that includes the successful destruction of the Company's ozone-depleting refrigerants. The project process involves a significant degree of regulatory compliance and only a limited number of facilities are approved to destroy ozone-depleting refrigerants. The uncertainty of regulatory project approval after carbon offsets have been produced results in unpredictable assurance of or timing for revenue recognition. If we are unable to find businesses that can effectively dispose of ozone-depleting refrigerants or if we do not receive project approval for the resulting carbon offsets, we could experience a material adverse effect to our operating results.\nWe could incur charges due to impairment of long-lived assets.\nAt December 30, 2017, we had long-lived asset balances of $26 million, which are subject to periodic testing for impairment. A significant amount of judgment is involved in the periodic testing. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow within our Geotraq business, or sales of our branded products or cash flow generated from operations at individual store locations could result in impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets or fixed asset impairment for long-lived assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations. Impairment charges, if any, resulting from the periodic testing are non-cash. A significant decline in the property fair values could result in long-lived asset impairment charges. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price could result in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. During times of financial market volatility, significant judgment is used to determine the underlying cause of the decline and whether stock price declines are short-term in nature or indicative of an event or change in circumstances. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIf we fail to implement our business strategy or if our business strategy is ineffective, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon the effectiveness of our business strategy and our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources.\nThere are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the following:\n\u00b7 Our employees, customers or investors may not embrace and support our strategy.\n\u00b7 We may not be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively.\n\u00b7 We may be unsuccessful in implementing improvements to operational efficiency and such efforts may not yield the intended result.\n\u00b7 We may record material charges against earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets.\nIn addition to the risks set forth above, effectiveness of and the successful implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve and could decline substantially.\nIf our third-party collection or delivery services are unable to meet our promised pickup and delivery schedules, our net sales may decline due to a decline in customer satisfaction.\nWe offer appliance pickup and delivery services, which are significantly outsourced to third-party providers. Our third-party services are subject to risks that are beyond our control. If appliances are not picked up on time, or at all, or products are not delivered on time, our clients and customers may cancel their orders, or we may lose business from our clients and customers in the future. As a result, our net sales and profitability may decline.\nA cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe use computers and transact, receive, transmit and store electronic data in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to communicate with our employees and our customers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information, including customers\u2019 personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the Company and its business partners. We also rely on a Payment Card Industry compliant third party to protect our customers\u2019 credit card information. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage.\nThere is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. Any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and may expose us to material costs, penalties, compensation claims, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.\nFailure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nCertain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature. The negative impact that sales and/or margin declines have on our business could make it more challenging for us to maintain or increase our operating income. The competitiveness in our industry and increasing price transparency means that the focus on achieving efficient operations is greater than ever. As a result, we must continuously focus on retaining and growing sales, maintaining and improving margins and managing our cost structure. Failure to manage our labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating leases, other facility expenses or indirect spending could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nAny failure of our information technology infrastructure or management information systems could cause a disruption in our business and our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur ability to operate our business from day to day largely depends on the efficient operation of our information technology infrastructure and management information systems. We use our management information systems to conduct our operations and plan critical corporate and business functions, including store operations, recycling operations, sales management, supply chain and inventory management, financial reporting and accounting, delivery and other customer services and various administrative functions. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees. Operating legacy systems subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading and replacing these systems and retaining sufficiently skilled personnel to maintain and operate the systems which may also place demands on management time, as well as create other risks and costs. Any failure that is not covered by our disaster recovery plan could cause an interruption in our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur sales may not be an indication of our future results of operations because they fluctuate significantly.\nOur current and historical sales figures have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our sales results and profitability, including:\n\u00b7 Changes in competition, such as pricing pressure, and the opening of new stores by competitors in our markets.\n\u00b7 Periodic sale of carbon offsets resulting from the responsible destruction of certain refrigerants.\n\u00b7 Inability to comply with or to identify third parties capable of complying with protocols required for responsible destruction of certain refrigerants.\n\u00b7 Fluctuating commodity prices and available markets for our byproduct sales.\n\u00b7 Changes in recycling and replacement programs with utility customers.\n\u00b7 General economic conditions.\n\u00b7\nConsumer trends.\n\u00b7 Weather conditions in our markets.\n\u00b7 Timing of promotional events.\n\u00b7 The locations of our stores and traffic drawn to those areas.\n\u00b7 Our ability to execute our business strategies effectively.\nOur business is dependent on the general economic conditions in our markets.\nIn general, our sales depend on general economic factors and other conditions that may affect our business, include periods of slow economic growth or recession, political factors including uncertainty in social or fiscal policy, an overly anti-business climate or sentiment, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing for us and our customers, slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income, sustained high rates of unemployment, high consumer debt levels, increasing fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters, and acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism. Additionally, any of these circumstances concentrated in a region of the U.S. in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations. General economic conditions and discretionary spending are beyond our control and are affected by, among other things:\n\u00b7 Consumer confidence in the economy.\n\u00b7 Unemployment trends.\n\u00b7 Consumer debt levels.\n\u00b7 Consumer credit availability.\n\u00b7 The housing and home improvement markets.\n\u00b7 Gasoline and fuel prices.\n\u00b7 Interest rates and inflation.\n\u00b7 Foreign currency exchange rates.\n\u00b7 Slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income.\n\u00b7 Natural disasters.\n\u00b7 National and geopolitical concerns.\n\u00b7 Tax rates and tax policy.\n\u00b7 Other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.\n\u00b7 Commodity prices.\nVolatility in financial markets may cause some of the above factors to change with an even greater degree of frequency and magnitude. The above factors could result in slowdown in the economy or an uncertain economic outlook, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to hire, train and retain key management, qualified managers, other employees and subcontracted agents, we could have difficulty implementing our business strategy, which may result in reduced net sales, operating margins and profitability.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed in the future, our level of customer service may decline, which may decrease our net sales and profitability. Other factors that impact our ability to maintain sufficient levels of qualified employees and agents in all areas of the business include, but are not limited to, the Company\u2019s reputation, worker morale, the current macroeconomic environment, competition from other employers, and our ability to offer adequate compensation packages. Adverse changes in health care costs could also adversely impact our ability to achieve our operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to our employees. Our ability to control labor costs, which may impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing healthcare benefits or labor relations and health and other insurance costs. If our labor and/or benefit costs increase, we may not be able to hire or maintain qualified personnel to the extent necessary to execute our competitive strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur statutory, regulatory and legal environment exposes us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results. The most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:\n\u00b7 The difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, state and national jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 The impact of proposed, new or changing statues and regulations, including, but not limited to, corporate governance matters, environmental impact, financial reform, Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act, health care reform, labor reform, and/or other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure.\n\u00b7 The impact of changes in tax laws (or interpretations thereof by courts and taxing authorities) and accounting standards.\n\u00b7 The impact of litigation, including class action or individual lawsuits involving shareholders, and labor and employment litigation related matters.\n\u00b7 Changes in trade regulations, currency fluctuations, economic or political instability, natural disasters, public health emergencies and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages of these items, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our cost of revenues, or may force us to increase prices, thereby adversely impacting net sales and profitability.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking action which, in either case, could adversely affect our operations or reduce our net income. There can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor. Any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages, including punitive damages. Additionally, defending against regulatory changes, lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from other matters which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSignificant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses.\nThe price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. Our collection and delivery agents need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and delivery of appliance activities in both our retail and recycling segments. Supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses. Additionally, if fuel prices increase, our direct operating expenses will increase and many of our vendors may raise their prices as a means to offset their rising costs. We may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs to our customers and some contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.\nWe lease most of our corporate headquarters and recycling centers. Our continued growth and success depends in part on our ability to locate desirable property for new recycling centers and renew leases for existing locations. Because there is no assurance that we will be able to locate acceptable real estate for new recycling centers; or re-negotiate leases for existing locations at similar or favorable terms at the end of the lease term, we could be forced to move or exit a market if another favorable arrangement cannot be made. Furthermore, a significant rise in real estate prices or real property taxes could result in an increase in lease expense as we open new locations and renew leases for existing locations, thereby negatively impacting the Company's results of operations. The inability of the Company to renew, extend or replace expiring leases could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, which could materially harm our business.\nIf an existing recycling center is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under that lease. Our inability to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for stores or recycling centers that we close could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nOur failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls could result in inaccurate reporting of financial results and harm our business.\nWe are required to comply with a variety of reporting, accounting and other rules and regulations. As such, we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, but there are limitations inherent in internal control systems. A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be appropriate relative to their costs. Furthermore, compliance with existing requirements is expensive and we may need to implement additional finance and accounting and other systems, procedures and controls to satisfy our reporting requirements. If our internal control over financial reporting continues to be evaluated as ineffective, such failure could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, negatively affect the market price of our common stock, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties, and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nOur revenues from recycling and appliance replacement contracts are very difficult to project and the loss or modification of major recycling and appliance replacement contracts could adversely impact our profits.\nOur business is dependent largely upon our ability to obtain new contracts and continue existing contracts for appliance recycling services and appliance replacement programs with utility companies and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs. Contracts with these entities generally have initial terms of one to three years, with renewal options and early termination clauses. However, some contracts are for programs that are non-recurring. Although we continue to respond to utility companies and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs requesting bids for upcoming recycling services, we are still dependent on certain customers for a large portion of our revenues. The loss or material reduction of business from any of these major customers could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. While we wish to add new recycling and appliance replacement contracts in 2018 and beyond, we cannot assure you that our existing contracts will continue, that they will be sufficiently profitable, that existing customers will continue to use our services at current levels or we will be successful in obtaining new recycling and replacement contracts going forward.\nOur revenues from recycling contracts are subject to seasonal fluctuations and are dependent on the utilities\u2019 advertising and promotional activities for contracts in which we do not provide advertising services.\nIn our business with utility companies, we experience seasonal fluctuations that impact our operating results. Our recycling revenues are generally higher during the second and third calendar quarters and lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters, due largely to the promotional activity schedules of which we have no control in advertising programs managed by the utilities. Our staff communicates client-driven advertising activities internally in an effort to achieve an operational balance. We expect that we will continue to experience such seasonal fluctuations in recycling revenues.\nWe may need new capital to fully execute our growth strategy.\nOur business involves providing comprehensive, integrated appliance recycling and replacement services and operating a chain of retail stores. This commitment will require a significant continuing investment in capital equipment and leasehold improvements and could require additional investment in real estate.\nOur total capital requirements will depend on, among the other things discussed in this annual report, the number of recycling centers and the number and size of retail stores operating during 2018 and thereafter. Currently, we have thirteen recycling centers in operation. If our revenues are lower than anticipated, our expenses are higher than anticipated or our line of credit cannot be maintained, we will require additional capital to finance our operations. Even if we are able to maintain our line of credit, we may need additional equity or other capital in the future. Sources of additional financing, if needed in the future, may include further debt financing or the sale of equity (including the issuance of preferred stock) or other securities. We cannot assure you that any additional sources of financing or new capital will be available to us, available on acceptable terms or permitted by the terms of our current debt agreements. In addition, if we sell additional equity to raise funds, all outstanding shares of common stock will be diluted.\nChanges in governmental regulations relating to our recycling business could increase our costs of operations and adversely affect our business.\nOur appliance recycling centers are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements related to providing turnkey services for energy efficiency programs. These requirements vary by market location and include, for example, laws concerning the management of hazardous materials and the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, which require us to recapture CFC refrigerants from appliances to prevent their release into the atmosphere.\nOur ability to generate revenue from the sale of carbon offsets created through the voluntary destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants could also be adversely affected by governmental regulations as the market develops. Should the federal government mandate the destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants in the future, we would be required to destroy these substances without the benefit of generating carbon offsets, which would increase the cost of our operations.\nWe have registered our centers with the EPA as hazardous waste generators and have obtained required licenses from appropriate state and local authorities. We have agreements with approved and licensed hazardous waste companies for transportation and recycling or disposal of hazardous materials generated through our recycling processes. As is the case with all companies handling hazardous materials, under some circumstances we may be subject to contingent liability. We believe we are in compliance with all government regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials, and we have environmental insurance to mitigate the impact of any potential contingent liability.\nIn addition, changes and proposed changes by the Trump Administration and the head of the EPA indicate that the regulation of the emission of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d and other ozone-depleting substances may be less of a priority. In addition, the Trump Administration and head of the EPA have announced that they intend to rescind or have already rescinded various environmental regulations established and enforced by previous administrations. As a result, further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments are difficult to predict. Even if federal environmental efforts slow, states may continue pursuing new regulations. These changes by the Trump Administration and the EPA, together with other purposed changes, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Technology Business\nGeoTraq has incurred significant operating losses since inception and expects the losses will continue into the future. If the losses continue GeoTraq may have to suspend operations or cease operations.\nGeoTraq has no operating history upon which an evaluation of its future success or failure can be made. GeoTraq has incurred significant operating losses since inception and has limited financial resources to support it until such time that it is able to generate positive cash flow from operations. GeoTraq\u2019s ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon its ability to (i) develop its technology and (ii) generate revenues from its planned business operations. Based upon current plans, GeoTraq expects to continue to incur operating losses in future periods. Failure to generate revenues may cause GeoTraq to suspend or cease operations\nGeoTraq is in the early stages of development.\nGeoTraq is developing a new technology and may encounter difficulties including unanticipated problems relating to the development and testing of its product, initial and continuing regulatory compliance, vendor manufacturing costs, production and assembly of its product, and the competitive and regulatory environments in which the company intends to operate. It is uncertain, at this stage of its development, if GeoTraq is unable to effectively resolve any such problems, should they occur. If GeoTraq cannot resolve an unanticipated problem, it may be forced to modify or abandon its business plan.\nGeoTraq does not have sufficient funds to complete each phase of its proposed plan of operation and as a result may have to suspend operations.\nEach of the phases of GeoTraq\u2019s plan of operation is limited and restricted by the amount of working capital that GeoTraq has and is able to raise from financings and generate from business operations. GeoTraq currently does not have sufficient funds to complete each phase of its proposed plan of operation and management expects that GeoTraq will not satisfy its cash requirements for the next 12 months. As a result, GeoTraq may have to suspend or cease its operations on one or more phases of its proposed plan of operation.\nUntil such time as GeoTraq is able to generate any consistent and significant revenue, it will be required to raise the required funds by way of equity or debt financing. GeoTraq intends to finance its plan of operation with private loans and equity financing initially and then with revenues generated from its business operations. If GeoTraq cannot raise the funds necessary to proceed it may have to suspend operations until it has sufficient capital.\nGeoTraq plans to outsource the research and development of its technology, and as a result it will be dependent upon those third-party developers to develop our products in a timely and cost-efficient manner while maintaining a minimum level of quality.\nGeoTraq does not have internal manufacturing capabilities and relies on contract manufacturers to manufacture its products. GeoTraq cannot be certain that it will not experience operational difficulties with its future manufacturers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs and increased lead times. Additionally, GeoTraq\u2019s future manufacturers may experience disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, component or material shortages, cost increases or other similar problems. Further, in order to minimize their inventory risk, GeoTraq\u2019s future manufacturers might not order components from third-party suppliers with adequate lead time, thereby impacting its ability to meet demand forecasts. Therefore, if GeoTraq fails to manage its relationship with its manufacturers effectively, or if they experience operational difficulties, GeoTraq\u2019s ability to ship products could be impaired and its competitive position and reputation could be harmed.\nIn the event that GeoTraq receives shipments of products that fail to comply with its technical specifications or that fail to conform to its quality control standards, and it is not able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, GeoTraq risks revenue losses from the inability to sell those products, increased administrative and shipping costs, and lower profitability. Additionally, if defects are not discovered until after customers purchase its products, GeoTraq customers could lose confidence in the technical attributes of its products and its business could be harmed.\nGeoTraq will not control its future contract manufacturers or suppliers, including their labor, environmental or other practices, or require them to comply with a formal code of conduct. However, GeoTraq intends to conduct periodic audits of its contract manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 compliance with applicable laws and good industry practices, these audits may not be frequent or thorough enough to detect non-compliance. A violation of labor, environmental or other laws by its contract manufacturers or suppliers, or a failure of these parties to follow ethical business practices, could lead to negative publicity and harm GeoTraq\u2019s reputation. In addition, GeoTraq may choose to seek alternative manufacturers or suppliers if these violations or failures were to occur. Identifying and qualifying new manufacturers or suppliers can be time consuming and GeoTraq may not be able to substitute suitable alternatives in a timely manner or at an acceptable cost. Other consumer products companies have faced significant criticism for the actions of their manufacturers and suppliers, and GeoTraq could face such criticism as well. Any of these events could adversely affect its brand, harm its reputation, reduce demand for its products and harm its ability to meet demand if it needs to identify alternative manufacturers or suppliers.\nGeoTraq\u2019s success depends on sales and adoption of its technology for asset tracking and theft recovery.\nGeoTraq\u2019s revenue will be derived from module sales and recurring fees that GeoTraq receives from resellers that support end users who purchase and activate a Cell-ID product using the company\u2019s technology. Depending on the products created by companies that use our Cell-ID module, GeoTraq will receive recurring revenue based on the number of activations and ongoing monthly service. GeoTraq\u2019s short term success depends heavily on achieving significantly increased customer adoption of its Technology either through stand alone or integrated products. GeoTraq\u2019s success also depends on achieving widespread deployment of the Technology by attracting and retaining additional manufacturing partners. The use of the Technology will depend on the pricing, quality and features of the Cell-ID module to be integrated into location-based products which may vary by market, as well as the level of subscriber turnover experienced by cellular subscriptions. If subscriber turnover increases more than management anticipates, GeoTraq\u2019s financial results could be adversely affected.\nCellular service providers on which GeoTraq\u2019s technology is dependent may change the terms by which the technology is used on their networks, which could result in lower revenue and adverse effects on our business.\nIf the cellular service providers on which GeoTraq\u2019s technology is to be used changes the terms of use or eliminates the ability to use products that incorporate GeoTraq\u2019s technology, GeoTraq could lose customers as they would no longer be able to use GeoTraq\u2019s technology in their products. In addition, GeoTraq could be required to change its fee structure to retain customers, which could negatively affect GeoTraq\u2019s gross margins. The cellular service providers may also decide to raise prices, impose usage caps or fees, or discontinue certain application bundles, which could adversely affect end users who use GeoTraq\u2019s technology. If imposed, these pricing changes or usage restrictions could make GeoTraq\u2019s technology less attractive and could result in current end users abandoning GeoTraq\u2019s technology. If end user turnover increased, the number of GeoTraq\u2019s end users and GeoTraq\u2019s revenue would decrease and its business would be harmed.\nGeoTraq\u2019s ability to increase or maintain its customer base and revenue will be impaired if cellular service providers do not allow GeoTraq Technology access to their networks.\nGeoTraq\u2019s technology requires cellular service to operate. The products produced by manufactures will require end users to maintain service with cellular service providers. If cellular service providers do not permit end users to purchase the cellular connectivity the product requires, GeoTraq may have difficulty attracting manufacturing customers because of the lack of, or difficulty in purchasing and provisioning a service plan. If the end user is unable to provide seamless provisioning or the carrier cancels their subscriptions, GeoTraq\u2019s business may be harmed.\nGeoTraq may not be able to enhance its technology to keep pace with technological and market developments or develop new technology in a timely manner or at competitive prices.\nThe market for location-based products and services is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles. To keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasing customer requirements and achieve product acceptance, GeoTraq\u2019s future success depends upon its ability to enhance its current technology and to continue to develop and introduce new technology and enhanced performance features and functionality on a timely basis at competitive prices. GeoTraq\u2019s inability, for technological or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce or deliver compelling technology in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing market conditions, technologies or consumer expectations could have a material adverse effect on GeoTraq\u2019s operating results or could result in its Technology becoming obsolete. GeoTraq\u2019s ability to compete successfully will depend in large measure on its ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry, including providing for the continued compatibility of its technology with evolving industry standards and protocols and competitive network operating environments. Development and delivery schedules for newly developed technology are difficult to predict. GeoTraq in the past, and may in the future, fail to deliver new versions of its technology in a timely fashion. If new releases of GeoTraq\u2019s Technology are delayed or not integrated into products upon their initial commercial release, the manufactures may curtail their efforts to market and promote GeoTraq\u2019s technology and may switch to competing products or services, any of which would result in a delay or loss of revenue and could harm GeoTraq\u2019s business. In addition, GeoTraq cannot provide any assurance that the technology it develops will be brought to market as quickly as anticipated or that the technology will achieve broad acceptance among wireless carriers or consumers.\nIf GeoTraq is unable to develop or modify its technology for new customer products, GeoTraq\u2019s revenue growth may be adversely affected and its net income could decline.\nIf GeoTraq does not develop or modify its technology for new products envisioned or introduced by our customers to increase the number of customer end users who use GeoTraq\u2019s technology, GeoTraq may not be able to increase its revenue in the longer term. GeoTraq\u2019s sales and marketing efforts may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. If GeoTraq fails to develop or modify its technology to attract new customers and new subscribers or its new Technology is not successful, GeoTraq may be unable to increase its revenue and its operating results may be adversely affected.\nGeoTraq\u2019s business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that its technology or another aspect of its business infringes the intellectual property rights of others.\nThe markets in which GeoTraq competes are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and trade secrets and also by litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups have purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement to extract settlements from companies like GeoTraq. Also, third parties may make infringement claims against GeoTraq that relate to technology developed and owned by one of its suppliers for which its suppliers may or may not indemnify GeoTraq. Even if GeoTraq is indemnified against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations and determining the scope of these obligations could require additional litigation. Claims of intellectual property infringement against GeoTraq or its suppliers might require GeoTraq to redesign its products, rebrand its services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting GeoTraq from marketing or selling its products or services. If GeoTraq cannot or does not license the infringed intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar intellectual property from another source, its revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, GeoTraq\u2019s customers, distributors and retailers may not purchase its offerings if they are concerned that they may infringe third-party intellectual property rights. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend in litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, damage GeoTraq\u2019s reputation and brand and cause it to incur significant expenses. The occurrence of any of these events may have an adverse effect on GeoTraq\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nGeoTraq faces significant competition and failure to successfully compete in the industry with established companies may result in GeoTraq\u2019s inability to continue with its business operations.\nThere are other companies that provide similar products and services. Management expects competition in this market to increase significantly as new companies enter the market and current competitors expand their products and services. GeoTraq\u2019s competitors may develop or offer technology or products that are better than GeoTraq\u2019s or that achieve greater market acceptance. It is also possible that new competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share. Competitive pressures created by any one of these companies, or by GeoTraq\u2019s competitors collectively, could have a negative impact on GeoTraq\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition and as a result, GeoTraq may not be able to continue with its business operations. In addition, if GeoTraq is unable to develop and introduce new or enhanced products and services quickly enough to respond to market or user requirements or to comply with emerging industry standards, or if these products do not achieve market acceptance, GeoTraq may not be able to compete effectively.\nMany of GeoTraq\u2019s competitors have greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, public relations, sales, distribution and other resources than GeoTraq. Some of GeoTraq\u2019s competitors\u2019 and its potential competitors\u2019 advantages over GeoTraq, either globally or in particular geographic markets, include the following: (a) offering their services at no or low cost to customers; (b) significantly greater revenue and financial resources; (c) stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide; (d) the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of location based technologies and products; (e) access to core technology and intellectual property, including more extensive patent portfolios; (f) access to custom or proprietary content; (g) quicker pace of innovation; (h) stronger wireless carrier relationships; (i) greater resources to make and integrate acquisitions; (j) lower labor and development costs; and (k) broader global distribution and presence.\nChanges in government regulation of the wireless communications industry may adversely affect GeoTraq\u2019s business.\nCurrently, other than business and operations licenses applicable to most commercial ventures, GeoTraq is not required to obtain any governmental approval for its business operations. However, there can be no assurance that current or new laws or regulations will not, in the future, impose additional fees and taxes on GeoTraq and its business operations.\nIt is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted in the United States and elsewhere that could restrict the wireless communications industry, including laws and regulations regarding lawful interception of personal data, privacy, taxation, content suitability, copyright and antitrust. Management anticipates that regulation of the industry will increase and that GeoTraq will be required to devote legal and other resources to address this regulation. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding the wireless communications industries may lessen the growth of wireless communications services and may adversely impact the financial results of GeoTraq\u2019s business operations.\nGeoTraq may be subject to legal proceedings involving its technology that could result in substantial costs and which could materially harm GeoTraq\u2019s business operations.\nFrom time to time, GeoTraq may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by GeoTraq. These types of claims could result in increased costs of doing business through legal expenses, adverse judgments or settlements or require GeoTraq to change its business practices in expensive ways. Additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce GeoTraq\u2019s technology rights, to protect its trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm GeoTraq\u2019s business.\nGeoTraq may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of its technology and implementation of its proposed plan of operations.\nGeoTraq\u2019s future success depends largely upon the continued service of its board members, executive officers and other key personnel. GeoTraq\u2019s success also depends on its ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. Key personnel represent a significant asset, and the competition for these personnel is intense in the communications industry.\nGeoTraq may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel in initial phases of its proposed plan of operations. GeoTraq does not maintain key person life insurance on any of its personnel. The loss of one or more of its key employees or its inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact GeoTraq\u2019s ability to complete any proposed phase of its plan of operations.\nGeoTraq\u2019s management lacks any formal training or experience in offshore manufacturing and supply chain management, and as a result management may make mistakes, which could have a negative impact on GeoTraq\u2019s business operations.\nGeoTraq\u2019s management is inexperienced in researching and developing technology. Management has no direct training or experience in these areas and, as a result, may not be fully aware of all of the specific requirements related to working within this industry. Management\u2019s decisions and choices may not take into account standard managerial approaches technology companies commonly use. Consequently, GeoTraq\u2019s operations, earnings, and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to management\u2019s lack of experience in this industry. As a result, GeoTraq may have to suspend or cease operations and GeoTraq\u2019s business operations may be negatively impacted.\nGeoTraq\u2019s business and products are subject to a variety of additional U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that are central to our business and its failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business or our operating results.\nGeoTraq is or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to its business, including laws and regulations regarding consumer protection, advertising, privacy, intellectual property, manufacturing, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions.\nGeoTraq\u2019s modules are subject to regulation by various U.S. state and federal and foreign agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission. If GeoTraq fails to comply with any of these regulations, it could become subject to enforcement actions or the imposition of significant monetary fines, other penalties, or claims, which could harm its operating results or its ability to conduct its business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur principal shareholders own a large percentage of our voting stock, which will allow them to control substantially all matters requiring shareholder approval.\nCurrently, Edward R. (Jack) Cameron, the former President of our recycling segment, beneficially owns approximately 9.3% of our common stock. In addition, Isaac Capital Group, LLC, Abacab Capital Management LLC and Energy Efficiency Investments LLC own approximately 8.6%, 6.4% and 9.7%, respectively, of our outstanding common shares. Three of our current directors are also on the board of directors of Live Ventures Incorporated, a publicly held corporation controlled by Isaac Capital Group, LLC and led by Jon Isaac as its President and Chief Executive Officer. Because of such ownership, our principal shareholders may be able to significantly, and possibly adversely, affect our corporate decisions, including the election of the board of directors.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock in the public market may negatively affect our stock price.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a significant negative effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon exercise of outstanding options, the number of shares outstanding of our common stock could increase substantially. This increase, in turn, could dilute future earnings per share, if any, and could depress the market value of our common stock. Dilution and potential dilution, the availability of a large amount of shares for sale, and the possibility of additional issuances and sales of our common stock may negatively affect both the trading price of our common stock and the liquidity of our common stock. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we would deem appropriate.\nThe trading volumes in our common stock are highly variable, which could adversely affect the value and liquidity of your investment in our common stock.\nThere is only a limited trading market for our common stock, which is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Markets. Transactions in our common stock may lack the volume and liquidity necessary to maintain an orderly trading market and this could result in both depressed and highly variable trading prices. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock into the public market at the same time could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The trading volume and market price of our common stock could also be adversely affected if we do not maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Markets.\nOur stock price may fluctuate and be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to the following factors, among others:\n\u00b7 Variations in our financial results.\n\u00b7 Changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance or interpretations.\n\u00b7 Sales of substantial amounts of our stock by existing shareholders.\n\u00b7 General economic conditions.\nThe stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the price of our common stock to fall abruptly or remain significantly depressed.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business. In addition, the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation, a ruling against us, or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe do not intend to declare dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors, will require approval by our lender and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Therefore, dividend income should not be expected from shares of our common stock.\nThe Nevada Revised Statute contains provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, prevent attempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our stock.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our articles of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to two million shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. As a result, without further stockholder approval, the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock. With these rights, preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the NRS. Depending on the number of residents in the state of Nevada who own our shares, we could be subject to the provisions of Sections 78.378 et seq. of the Nevada Revised Statutes which, unless otherwise provided in the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation or by-laws, restricts the ability of an acquiring person to obtain a controlling interest of 20% or more of our voting shares. Our articles of incorporation and by-laws do not contain any provision which would currently keep the change of control restrictions of Section 78.378 from applying to us.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Sections 78.411 et seq. of the Nevada Revised Statutes. In general, this statute prohibits a publicly held Nevada corporation from engaging in a \u201ccombination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the combination or the transaction by which the person became an interested stockholder is approved by the corporation\u2019s board of directors before the person becomes an interested stockholder. After the expiration of the three-year period, the corporation may engage in a combination with an interested stockholder under certain circumstances, including if the combination is approved by the board of directors and/or stockholders in a prescribed manner, or if specified requirements are met regarding consideration. The term \u201ccombination\u201d includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years did own, 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. A Nevada corporation may \u201copt out\u201d from the application of Section 78.411 et seq. through a provision in its articles of incorporation or by-laws. We have not \u201copted out\u201d from the application of this section.", "PERMNO": 77202, "SIC": 4953, "TIC": "JAN"}
