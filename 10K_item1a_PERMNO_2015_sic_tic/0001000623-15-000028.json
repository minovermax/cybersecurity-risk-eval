Risk Factors\nFactors That May Affect Future Results\nMany risk factors both within and outside of our control could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and on the market price of our common stock. While not an exhaustive list, the following important risk factors could affect our future results, including our actual results for 2015 and thereafter and could also cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we have made or may make.\nWe expect our business to be impacted by governmental actions relating to tobacco products, as well as by decreased demand for tobacco products relating to declining social acceptance of smoking in the United States and certain other countries.\nIn 2014, approximately 76% of our net sales were from products used by the tobacco industry in making cigarettes or other tobacco products. In recent years, governmental entities around the world, particularly in the United States, Brazil, Russia, Australia and western Europe, have taken, or have proposed, actions that had, and are likely to continue to have, the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products which, in turn, reduces demand for our products. Reports with respect to the possible harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking, including second-hand smoke, and use of other tobacco products have been publicized for many years. Such reports, together with actions to regulate, restrict or prohibit the sale, advertisement and promotion of tobacco products, including cigarettes and their components, to limit smoking in public places, to control or restrict additives that may be used in tobacco products and to increase taxes on such products, are intended to discourage the consumption of traditional cigarettes and other such products. In recent years, certain governmental entities, particularly in North America and Europe, have enacted, considered or proposed actions that would require cigarettes to meet specifications aimed at reducing their likelihood of igniting fires when the cigarettes are not actively being smoked. It is not possible to predict the additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products that may be enacted, additional countries that may adopt such legislation or regulations, or the extent to which such legislation, regulations or the development of new products or technologies, such as e-cigarettes, may impact the design or formulation of our customers' products, the demand for traditional cigarettes and our business and financial performance.\nCigarette consumption in certain regions such as the United States and Western Europe has declined, in part due to the actions described above, to the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and to actions on the part of private parties to restrict smoking. These declines have had an adverse effect on demand for our products in these regions and other affected regions. We expect such factors will continue to reduce smoking levels and potentially adversely affect demand for our products. In addition, litigation is pending against major manufacturers of consumer tobacco products seeking damages for health problems allegedly resulting from the use of tobacco in various forms. It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or the effect adverse developments in pending or future litigation may have on the tobacco industry or its demand for our products, but in the past, increases in taxes and litigation have adversely affected demand. In the U.S., the regulatory jurisdiction of the federal Food and Drug Administration was extended in 2009 to include tobacco products, which products are now subject to product component disclosure regulations, new controls on ingredients, and additional restrictions relating to marketing and labeling. The federal Food and Drug Administration could promulgate additional regulations to areas it has not to date regulated or has only lightly regulated such as certain cigars. In Brazil, regulations limit the use of additives to cigarettes. In the European Union, the Tobacco Products Directive regulates the content, effects, marketing and labeling of tobacco products, and both revisions to the Directive and the ongoing phase-in of the REACH regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemical Substances) may further restrict product ingredients. Additionally, the World Health Organization is actively promoting tobacco regulation, and other countries worldwide are in the process of adopting some or all of these restrictions. The impact of these legislative and regulatory initiatives on the production and sale of our and our customers' products is not presently known but could adversely affect our results.\nThe overall demand for conventional tobacco cigarettes in certain regions such as the United States and Western Europe has generally been declining in terms of volume of sales. In addition to the governmental actions referred to above, there is and continues to be a decline in the social acceptability of smoking and increased awareness of health risks relating to tobacco products. Such a decline has led, and could lead, to certain merchants deciding not to sell tobacco products(e.g. CVS drug stores), thus potentially adversely impacting demand for our products.\nOur technological advantages are unlikely to continue indefinitely.\nWe consider our intellectual property and patents to be a material asset. We have been at the forefront of developing new products and technology within our industries and have patented several of our innovations, particularly with regard to cigarette paper used to produce LIP cigarettes. This has enhanced our ability to sell products and to provide added function and other value to the products we sell allowing them to command higher margins. This advantage has also enabled us to license certain of our patents and know-how and earn royalty income from third parties. Presently, we are seeing evidence of increasing efforts and activity by our competitors and some customers to develop and sell competitive products, particularly in the area of papers used for lower ignition propensity applications and e-cigarettes, with the effect of creating pricing pressure on our LIP products. Over time, we expect our competitors to develop competitive products that are designed to avoid our intellectual property or to license our innovations. Ultimately, our patents will expire. As we expand our production of LIP papers, RTL and our Filtration operations to more locations and countries, the risk of the loss of proprietary trade secrets will increase, and any significant loss would result in the loss of the competitive advantages provided by such trade secrets. While we cannot predict the impact or the timing of these trends and eventualities, they likely will reduce our sales and margins from the levels that we otherwise would have achieved.\nFurthermore, it is uncertain the extent to which LIP regulations will be adopted in additional regions, including as to the timing of such adoptions and the technical standards that would be implemented. The absence of such adoptions or the failure to implement standards consistent with those in the U.S. and Western Europe could have an adverse impact on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEffectively policing our domestic and international intellectual property and patent rights is costly and may not be successful.\nOur portfolio of granted patents varies by country, which could have an impact on any competitive advantage provided by patents in individual markets. We rely on patent, trademark, and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries to protect our intellectual property rights. In order to maintain the benefits of our patents, we may\nbe required to enforce certain of our patents against infringement through judicial or administrative actions. For example, in early 2015 we initiated patent infringement proceedings in Germany against a competitor under multiple LIP-related patents. The cost, timing and outcome of intellectual property litigation can be unpredictable and thus no assurances can be given as to the outcome or impact on us of such litigation. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able, or that it will be economic for us, to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property or infringing our patents without our authorization, which may reduce any competitive advantage we have developed. Litigation to protect these rights is often costly and time consuming and could divert management resources with an uncertain outcome. We cannot guarantee that any United States or foreign patents, issued or pending, will continue to provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be successfully challenged by third parties.\nWe do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties. However, we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our products or services or a court or other governmental body may come to a different conclusion from ours. In that event, we may be subject to significant claims for damages or disruptions to our operations. Effectively policing our intellectual property and patents is time-consuming and costly, and the steps taken by us may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property, patents or other proprietary rights in our products, technology and trademarks, particularly in foreign countries where in many instances the local laws or legal systems do not offer the same level of protection as in the United States.\nIn December 2009, Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A., Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Pap\u00e9terie Leman SAS, and delfortgroup AG filed Notices of Opposition to the European Patent Office's, or the EPO, grant of our European Patent EP 1482815. The opponents contend that the claimed invention is not disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art and that the claims were either not novel or lacked inventive step due to prior art references (including, among others, two earlier patents of SWM cited by the Examiner prior to granting the patent). In connection with its entrance into a worldwide LIP license agreement with SWM, delfortgroup has withdrawn its opposition and is no longer a party to these proceedings (though delfortgroup's arguments and evidence presented remain in the proceedings). On September 15, 2014, Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A. withdrew its opposition and is no longer a party to the proceedings and SWM amended the patent claims. In its hearing on October 27, 2014, the Opposition Division of the EPO decided to maintain the patent in amended form. The EPO's written decision was issued on January 23, 2015 and is open to appeal by participants to the hearing. The final outcome of this dispute would not prevent the Company from practicing its ALGINEX\u00ae LIP solution. The patent remains in effect and is enforceable even while opposition appeal proceedings are pending.\nOn November 11, 2010, the EPO issued a Decision to Grant SWM European Patent No. 1333729. On December 8, 2010, Julius Glatz GmbH filed a Notice of Opposition to the grant of this patent. In September 2011, Pap\u00e9teries du Leman, delfortgroup AG, and Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A. each filed opposition papers and Glatz supplemented its previous filing. However, Pap\u00e9teries du Leman failed to pay the opposition fee and consequently is not a party to the opposition proceedings. It subsequently refiled its opposition papers as third-party observations. In connection with its entrance into a worldwide LIP license agreement with SWM, delfortgroup has withdrawn its opposition and is no longer a party to these proceedings (though delfortgroup's arguments and evidence presented will remain in the proceedings). In its hearing on January 21, 2015, the Opposition Division of the EPO decided to revoke the patent for claim 10 allegedly containing subject-matter that goes beyond the application as originally filed. The Company believes that the EPO properly granted the patent and intends to vigorously defend the patent. Accordingly, SWM plans to appeal the written decision that is expected to issue shortly. The patent remains in effect and enforceable while opposition appeal proceedings are pending.\nOn June 27, 2012, the EPO granted the Company's applications for two LIP-related patents, EP 2127544 and EP 2127545, that are based on divisional applications related to European Patent No. 1333729. Julius Glatz GmbH and Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A. each filed Notices of Opposition to the grant of EP 2127544. Julius Glatz GmbH, Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A. and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Pap\u00e9terie Leman SAS each filed Notices of Opposition to the grant of EP 2127545. SWM filed its responses to the Notices of Opposition on March 7, 2014. The Company believes that the EPO properly granted the patents, and intends to vigorously defend the patents.\nOn September 12, 2012, the EPO granted the Company's LIP patent, EP 2127543, that is based on a divisional application related to European Patent No. 1333729. Pap\u00e9teries du Leman, Julius Glatz GmbH and Miquel y Costas & Miquel\nS.A. each filed Notices of Opposition, and SWM filed its responses to the Notice of Opposition on March 21, 2014. The Company believes that the EPO properly granted the patent, and it intends to vigorously defend the patent.\nOn April 16, 2014, the EPO granted the Company's LIP related patent, EP 2319333, that is based on a divisional application related to European Patent No. 1845810. Julius Glatz GmbH filed a Notice of Opposition on January 16, 2015. The Company believes that the EPO properly granted the patent and it intends to vigorously defend the patent.\nAs referenced above, in January 2015, the Company initiated patent infringement proceedings in Germany against a competitor under multiple LIP-related patents. The cost, timing and outcome of intellectual property litigation can be unpredictable and thus no assurances can be given as to the outcome or impact on us of such litigation.\nOur financial performance can be significantly impacted by the cost of raw materials and energy.\nRaw materials are a significant component of the cost of the products that we manufacture. The cost of wood pulp, which is the largest component of the raw materials that we use, and of resins used by our Filtration segment are highly cyclical and can be more volatile than general consumer or producer inflationary changes in the general economy. For instance, during the period from January 2012 through December 2014, the U.S. list price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp, or NBSK, a representative pulp grade that we use, ranged from a low of $830 per metric ton in September 2012 to a high of $1,030 per metric ton in March 2014. Also, over the last five years, the cost of polypropylene has fluctuated from 70 cents per pound to 117 cents per pound. We periodically enter into agreements with customers under which we agree to supply products at fixed prices. As a consequence, unanticipated increases in the costs of raw materials, or the lack of availability of such raw materials (due to force majeure or other reasons), can significantly impact our financial performance. Even where we do not have fixed-price agreements, we generally cannot pass through increases in raw material costs in a timely manner and in many instances are not able to pass through the entire increase to our customers.\nPaper manufacturing is energy-intensive. In France, Poland and in the United States, availability of energy generally is reliable, although prices can fluctuate significantly based on variations in overall demand. Western Europe is becoming significantly dependent on energy supplies from the Commonwealth of Independent States, which in the past has demonstrated a willingness to restrict or cut off supplies of energy to certain customers. The volume of oil or gas flowing through pipeline systems that ultimately connect to western Europe also has been cut off or restricted in the past, and such actions can adversely impact the supply of energy to western Europe and, consequently, the cost and availability of electricity to our European operations. In Brazil, electricity is heavily taxed and because production of electricity is heavily reliant upon hydroelectric plants, availability of electricity can be, and has in the past been, affected by rain variations. Although our Brazilian business currently has a sufficient supply of energy to continue its current level of operation, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient supply in the future. Due to the competitive pricing for most of our products, we typically are unable to fully pass through higher energy costs to our customers. Periodically, when we believe it is advantageous to do so, we enter into agreements to procure a portion of our energy for future periods in order to reduce the uncertainty of future energy costs. However, in recent years this has only marginally slowed the increase in energy costs due to the volatile changes in energy prices we have experienced.\nHistorically, we have experienced significant cost savings and productivity benefits relating to our ongoing Operational Excellence program; however, these benefits may not continue indefinitely.\nHistorically, we have experienced significant cost savings and productivity benefits relating to our ongoing Operational Excellence program as it relates to our tobacco operations that have supported our margins during periods of significant attrition in the Tobacco industry. We expect to continue to achieve significant savings and benefits from this program, however, in light of continued industry attrition, execution risks and other factors, should we be unable to continue in the future to obtain these savings and benefits in line with historical achievements, our profitability and financial results could be adversely affected.\nBecause of the geographic diversity of our business, we are subject to a range of international risks.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in seven countries and two joint ventures in China and sell products in over 90 countries, many of which are emerging and undeveloped markets. Our manufacturing operations, sales and results, depending on their location, are subject to various international business risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nForeign countries can impose significant import, export, excise and income tax and other regulatory restrictions on business, including limitations on repatriation of profits and proceeds of liquidated assets. While we attempt to manage our operations and international movements of cash from and amongst our foreign subsidiaries in a tax-efficient manner, unanticipated international movement of funds due to unexpected changes in our business or changes in tax and associated regulatory schemes could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\n\u2022\nWe are exposed to global as well as regional macroeconomic and microeconomic factors, which can affect demand and pricing for our products, including: unsettled political and economic conditions, including as they relate to Russia and the Ukraine; expropriation; import and export tariffs; regulatory controls and restrictions; and inflationary and deflationary economies. These factors together with risks inherent in international operations, including risks associated with any non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the 2013 Brazilian Clean Companies Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the 2013 Russian Law on Preventing Corruption and other non-U.S. anti-bribery law compliance, could adversely affect our results;\n\u2022\nWe participate in two joint ventures and have one manufacturing facility in China. One joint venture sells our products primarily to Chinese tobacco companies. The second joint venture has built a new reconstituted tobacco mill in China which began operations in September 2014. Operations in China entail a number of risks including international and domestic political risks, the need to obtain operating and other permits from the government, adverse changes in the policies or in our relations with government-owned or run customers and any ability to operate within an evolving legal and economic system. There are also risks inherent with 50% joint ventures, such as a lack of an ability to control, and visibility with respect to the operations, customer relations and compliance aspects, among others; and\n\u2022\nChanges or increases in international trade sanctions may restrict or prohibit us from transacting business with established customers or securing new ones, including as to Russia and the Ukraine.\nChanges in the laws and regulations described above, adverse interpretations or applications of such laws and regulations, and the outcome of various court and regulatory proceedings, including in Europe and Brazil could adversely impact the Company's business in a variety of ways, including increasing expenses, increasing liabilities, decreasing sales, limiting its ability to repatriate funds and generally limiting its ability to conduct business, all of which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated from operations outside the United States. In addition, we maintain significant operations and acquire or manufacture many of our products outside the United States. The functional currency of our international subsidiaries is generally the local currency in which each subsidiary operates. In particular, a large portion of our commercial business is denominated in euros. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, we must translate revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities from functional currencies into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during, or at the end of the reporting period. As a result, our future revenues, costs, results of operations and earnings could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate.\nIn addition, some of our sale and purchase transactions are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of our operations. As a result, changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which the transaction is denominated versus the local currency of our operation into which the transaction is being recorded can impact the amount of local currency recorded for such transaction. This can result in more or less local currency revenue or cost related to such transaction and thus have an effect on our operating profit. Currency transaction risk is mitigated partially in France because some of the revenue and expense transactions of our French subsidiaries are denominated in U.S. dollars, providing a degree of natural hedging. Our Brazilian and Polish operations are more fully exposed to currency transaction risk, especially as a result of U.S. dollar and euro denominated sales, respectively.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates also impact the amount reported in other income (expense), net. For instance, when a non-local currency receivable or payable is not settled in the period in which it is incurred, we are required to record a gain or loss, as applicable, to reflect the impact of any change in the exchange rate as of the end of the period. We also have to reflect the translation rate impact on the carrying value of our foreign assets and liabilities as of the end of each period, which is recorded as Unrealized Translation Adjustment in Other Comprehensive Income.\nWe utilize a variety of practices to manage this risk, including operating and financing activities and, where considered appropriate, derivative instruments. All derivative instruments we use are either exchange traded or entered into with major financial institutions in order to reduce credit risk and risk of nonperformance by third parties. Counterparty risk cannot be eliminated and there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. We generally hedge foreign currency transactions risk primarily through the use of derivative instruments, including forward and swap contracts and, to a lesser extent, option contracts. The use of derivative instruments is intended to mitigate or reduce transactional level volatility in the results of foreign operations, but does not completely eliminate volatility. If our future revenues, costs and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad and/or we are unable to effectively hedge these risks, they could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent upon the availability of credit, and changes in interest rates can impact our business.\nWe supplement operating cash flow with bank borrowings under a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that matures in December 2018. To date, we have been able to access credit when needed and on commercially reasonable terms. However, deterioration of credit markets, including an economic crisis in the U.S. or elsewhere, whether or not caused by the U.S. or European debt ceiling, deficits and budget issues could have an adverse impact on our ability to negotiate new credit facilities or access or renew our existing one. Constraints on the availability of credit, or the unavailability of credit at reasonable interest rates, would negatively impact our business, including potentially impairing our ability to declare dividends, conduct share buy-backs and make acquisitions.\nOur credit facility contains financial covenants that we have historically fulfilled, and we do not presently anticipate any events that would impair our ability to meet those covenants in the future. However, in the event of material unforeseen events that impact on our financial performance, particularly during a time when we have material amounts of debt, a situation could arise where we are unable to fully draw from our existing credit facility notwithstanding that there is otherwise available capacity.\nWe have a combination of variable and fixed-rate debt consisting of short-term and long-term instruments. We selectively hedge our exposure to interest rate increases on our variable rate long-term debt when we believe that it is practical to do so. We have utilized various forms of interest rate hedge agreements, including interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements. There can be no certainty that our hedging activities will be successful or fully protect us from interest rate exposure.\nSeasonality can impact our business.\nSales of our Paper and Reconstituted Tobacco products in the United States, Europe and Brazil are subject to seasonal fluctuations. In the United States and Europe, customer shutdowns typically occur in July and December and historically have resulted in reduced net sales and operating profit during those two months. Additionally, our facilities occasionally shut down equipment to perform additional maintenance during these months or as a result of slow demand, resulting in higher product costs, higher maintenance expenses and reduced operating profit. In Brazil, customer orders are typically lower in December due to a holiday season during much of January and February.\nWe face competition from several established competitors and have limited market transparency.\nOur four largest competitors for our tobacco business are delfortgroup AG (Delfort), Julius Glatz GmbH (Glatz), Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A. and PT BUKIT Muria Jaya (BMJ). All four primarily operate from modern and cost-effective mills in western Europe and Asia and are capable and long-standing suppliers to the tobacco industry. Further, three such competitors, Delfort, Glatz and BMJ, are privately held and the third, Miquel y Costas, is a closely held public company. Thus, their financial results and other business developments and strategies are not disclosed to the same extent as ours, which provides them some advantage in dealing with customers. Given the concentration of most of our competitors in western Europe, which has seen declining demand for tobacco products and has labor laws that make reducing capacity expensive and slow, excess capacity exists and therefore price competition is acute. We believe that all four competitors have good relationships with the multinational cigarette companies, as does the Company. The multinational cigarette companies have been known to use these close relationships to encourage the development of enhanced competition through supporting competitive products and facilities, especially when confronted with new, high-value technologies such as porous plug wrap in the past and LIP today.\nOur Filtration segment, DelStar-branded products compete against niche products made by Conwed, a subsidiary of Leucadia National Corp., Marshall Manufacturing Company, Johns Manville, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Hollingsworth and Vose Company. We believe our Filtration products compete primarily on product features, innovations and customer service, however, the efforts of these competitors could have an impact on the results of our Filtration segment operations.\nAs a result of the foregoing, the Company faces significant selling price, sales volume and new product risks from its competitors, especially during periods (often annually) in which the Company's contracts with its major customers are subject to renewal or renegotiation.\nCurrently, fine papers used to produce cigarettes are only exported on a limited basis from available capacity in China and other Asian locations to western multinational cigarette companies due to government taxes and tariffs, which limit price competitiveness, as well as due to customer preferences. Should conditions change in this regard, capacity that currently is operating in China and elsewhere in Asia would present a risk to our competitive position in the developed world and elsewhere and place further pressure on our legacy paper production platforms.\nDue to many of the factors described above, we have a limited ability to predict trends in the industry and there may be a time lag before we become aware of developing trends in the industry. In the RTL market segment, demand is a function, among other things, of smoke delivery regulations, the cigarette manufacturer's desire for a uniform and consistent product, the taste profile sought by cigarette manufacturers and the cost of recycling the tobacco by-product scraps relative to the cost of virgin tobacco products. Thus, our RTL business is also subject to competitive risk from lower cost virgin tobacco leaf or other, cheaper, cigarette fillers. These factors could result in lower volumes for our RTL business, resulting in downtime of certain production machines and, in some cases, accelerated depreciation or impairment charges for certain equipment as well as employee severance expenses associated with downsizing or restructuring activities.\nFurther, as a result of excess capacity in the tobacco-related papers industry and increased operating costs, competitive levels of selling prices for certain of the Company's products are not sufficient to cover those costs with a margin that the Company considers reasonable. Such competitive pressures have resulted, and could result in the future, in downtime of certain production machines and, in some cases, accelerated depreciation or impairment charges for certain equipment as well as employee severance expenses associated with downsizing or restructuring activities.\nWe are dependent upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFour customers accounted for over 46% of our net sales in 2014. The loss of one or more of these customers, or a significant reduction in their purchases, particularly those that impact our value-added LIP papers or reconstituted tobacco, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial results. The enhanced capabilities provided by RTL in the area of product design and regulatory compliance are important to our customers. However, future RTL results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in customer inventories, changes in the cigarette tobacco blending approaches by our customers, changes in regulations and tariffs and the price of virgin tobacco leaf.\nIn addition, significant consolidation has occurred among our customers, thereby increasing our dependence upon a fewer number of customers and increasing the negotiating leverage of the customers that survive. If any of our customers were to change suppliers, in-source production of reconstituted tobacco or cigarette papers (including those used to produce LIP cigarettes), institute significant cost-cutting measures or experience financial difficulty, then these customers may substantially reduce their purchases from us, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results. In addition, adverse results in the negotiation of any of our significant customer contracts, the terms of which are typically negotiated every one to three years, could significantly impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to various environmental risks.\nOur facilities are subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws with respect to air, water and other emissions as well as the disposal of solid waste. We believe we are operating in substantial compliance with these laws and regularly incur capital and operating expenditures in order to maintain future compliance. However, these laws may change, which could require changes in our practices, additional capital expenditures or loss of carbon credits, and we may discover aspects of our business that are not in compliance. Violation of these laws can result in the imposition of significant fines and remediation costs. In France, we presently have sufficient authorized capacity for our emissions of carbon dioxide. However, this authorization must be renewed every five years. We cannot predict that we will have sufficient authorized capacity to conduct our operations in France as presently conducted or to do so without having to make substantial capital expenditures in future years. There also is the possibility of regulation of carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. It is not presently possible to assess what, if any, impact such regulations might have on our domestic U.S. operations.\nWe are a member of a potentially responsible party group (Global PRP Group) that has entered into a settlement with the State of New Jersey concerning the remediation of a landfill site in Middlesex County, New Jersey. The landfill remediation has been completed. We have established a reserve of less than $0.1 million that we believe is adequate to cover our ongoing liability, but we remain exposed to post-closure operating costs over an extended period of years that cannot be fully known or estimated at this time.\nAlthough we are not aware of any environmental conditions at any of our facilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, we own facilities in France, the U.S. and elsewhere that have been operated over the course of many decades. We may face higher disposal and clean-up costs to replace equipment or facilities containing materials that were compliant when installed, but are now considered contaminants. Additionally, as we sell closed facilities, we may be required to perform additional environmental evaluations that could identify items that might require remediation or other action, the nature, extent and cost of which are not presently known. We may also incur environmental liabilities in connection with assets or businesses we may purchase.\nWe are subject to various legal actions and other claims.\nWe regularly are involved in legal actions and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business and otherwise. We are also subject to many laws and regulations around the world. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with every such law or regulation. Because of the complexity of Brazilian tax laws and court systems, legal actions are a particular risk affecting our Brazilian operations. Although we believe that our positions in pending disputes about state and federal taxes are correct and will ultimately be upheld by Brazilian courts, the outcome of legal proceedings is difficult to predict. An adverse result in one or more of these tax disputes could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We are also subject to various other litigation in Brazil, including labor and workplace safety claims. Although we do not believe that any of the currently pending actions or claims against us will have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition, we cannot provide any assurances in this regard. Information concerning some of these actions that currently are pending is contained in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this report.\nOur internal and external expansion plans and asset dispositions entail different and additional risks relative to the rest of our business.\nFrom time to time, we consider acquisitions either within the tobacco industry or outside the industry in connection with our diversification initiatives, such as our acquisition of DelStar, Inc. and assets from Pronamic, Inc. and from SNN. This acquisition activity could involve confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement. Although we seek to maintain or improve the economic fundamentals of our business, it is possible that an acquisition could adversely impact our results, credit ratings or the outlook of our business. Also, acquisition opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve strategic objectives or anticipated synergies or returns. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, that we will realize the anticipated benefits or profits through acquisitions or that acquisitions will be accretive to earnings. Changes in our portfolio of businesses, assets and products, whether through acquisition, disposition or internal growth, present additional risks. Such activities, including diversification, and our acquisition of DelStar and other acquisitions, can lead us to incur unknown or new types of liabilities, subject us to new regulatory frameworks, new market risks, involve operations in new geographies with challenging labor, regulatory and tax regimes as well as the execution risks associated with such activities. The potential future expansion of our filtration or other operations could cause these operations to face additional competition from larger and more established competitors than is currently the case.\nThe ability to dispose of idled assets and the value that may be obtained relative to their book value can result in significant impairment charges. Some of these risks manifested themselves in early 2011 when we announced suspension of construction of a wholly-owned reconstituted tobacco mill in the Philippines and could be encountered in other forms to the extent that we construct new facilities or enter into new joint ventures. Building a new mill or other facility or rebuilding or otherwise modifying existing production machinery is a major project and entails a number of risks, including the possibility that the contractors and sub-contractors who are expected to build the facility or rebuild the machine and supply the necessary equipment do not perform as expected, that there will be cost overruns or that design defects or omissions cause the facility or machine to perform at less than projected efficiency or at less than projected capacity. In addition, commencement of production at a new site or at a rebuilt machine is time consuming and requires customer testing and acceptance, and potentially by regulators, of the products that are produced. Also, while we anticipate sufficient demand for the facility's or machine's output, there can be no assurances that the expected demand will materialize. For more information on our expansion plans, see Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\" of this report.\nWe also expect to continue to expend resources to diversify and expand our product portfolio. Research and development and product diversification have several inherent risks, including technical success, market acceptance, new regulations and potential liabilities. We cannot guarantee that such efforts will succeed or that we will achieve a satisfactory return on such expenditures.\nWe may not successfully integrate acquisitions and may be unable to achieve anticipated cost savings or other synergies.\nThe integration of acquired companies operations involves a number of risks and presents financial, managerial, legal and operational challenges. We may have difficulty, and may incur unanticipated expenses related to, integrating information systems, financial reporting activities, and integrating and retaining management and personnel from acquired companies. Additionally with respect to acquiring DelStar and the two associated acquisitions we made in December 2014 in our Filtration segment, we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or commercial or growth synergies, for a number of reasons, including contractual constraints and obligations or an inability to take advantage of expected commercial opportunities, increased operating efficiencies or commercial expansion of key technologies. Failure to successfully integrate acquired companies may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRestructuring activities significantly impact our business.\nWe initiated significant restructuring activities in 2006, 2007 and 2014 in France and the United States, during 2007 and 2014 in Brazil and during 2012 in the Philippines that have become part of an overall effort to improve an imbalance between demand for our products and our paper production capacity as well as improve our profitability and the quality of our products. We expect to continue these restructuring efforts from time to time. Restructuring of our existing operations, or as a result of acquisitions, involves issues that are complex, time-consuming and expensive and could significantly disrupt our business. The challenges involved in executing the actions that are part of our ongoing and, potentially future, restructuring plans include:\n\u2022\ndemonstrating to customers that the restructuring activities will not result in adverse changes in service standards or business focus;\n\u2022\nconsolidating administrative infrastructure and manufacturing operations while maintaining adequate controls throughout the execution of the restructuring;\n\u2022\npreserving distribution, sales and other important relationships and resolving potential conflicts that may arise;\n\u2022\nestimating, managing and minimizing the cost of the restructuring activities;\n\u2022\nminimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities;\n\u2022\nmaintaining employee morale, retaining key employees, maintaining reasonable collective bargaining agreements and avoiding strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest while implementing restructuring programs that often include reductions in the workforce;\n\u2022\nsecuring government approval of such plans, where necessary, and managing the litigation and associated liabilities that often are associated with restructuring actions;\n\u2022\nincurring costs associated with delays in restructuring activities caused by labor negotiations and/or governmental approvals;\n\u2022\ncoordinating and combining operations, which may be subject to additional constraints imposed by collective bargaining agreements and local laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nachieving the anticipated levels of net cost savings and efficiency as a result of the restructuring activities.\nIf we do not achieve expected benefits as a result of our legal entity realignment, the ability to achieve our financial guidance for operating results and cash-flow could be adversely affected.\nWe have re-examined and re-aligned certain internal business operations and our legal entity structure in order to improve our cash-flows, have easier access to our foreign cash, centralize and streamline certain internal business activities . This has resulted in a reduction of our overall effective tax rate, among other things. Steps to accomplish these objectives have been taken and additional steps may be taken later as we continue to grow certain of our operations, diversify our business and continue our business analyses. We anticipate that there could be further realignment activities in the future.\nRealignments present significant potential risks of events occurring that could delay, halt or adversely affect the success of the project, including delays encountered in finalizing the scope of, and implementing, the realignment, the failure to achieve targeted benefits or savings, the failure to follow appropriate regulatory requirements or internal processes and procedures and a potential decrease in employee morale. Further, despite obtaining certain tax rulings, there can be no assurance that the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or to which we are otherwise deemed to have sufficient tax nexus, will not challenge the tax benefits that we expect to realize as a result of the realignment. Any such challenges can be time consuming or expensive with potentially uncertain outcomes, including as to interest, penalties and/or increase in back taxes. In addition, changes to U.S. or non-U.S. tax laws may negatively impact the anticipated benefits of the proposed realignment. Any future impact to our effective tax rate will also depend on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with the regulatory requirements for such a realignment including applicable taxing provisions, as well as us realizing our anticipated profits. Further, we have incurred certain costs in connection with the realignment and we may incur additional costs, including ones that are not currently expected to be incurred.\nTo the extent these risks or circumstances occur, we may fail to achieve the future financial and business benefits that we anticipate as a result of the realignment and our future operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be negatively impacted. Thus, there can also be no assurance that we will realize the expected future benefits of the restructuring.\nOne portion of our business is dependent upon a single mill; Further, we have limited cross redundancy across our facilities.\nSales of reconstituted tobacco leaf products represent a substantial portion of our revenues and profits. We presently produce reconstituted tobacco leaf at only one facility located in France and wrapper and binder products at only one facility located in Ancram, New York. The loss of or the interruption of operations for a significant length of time due to a casualty event or otherwise at either facility could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, in order to achieve operational efficiencies, among other reasons, we have limited ability to shift production across our various facilities, thus the loss of production at one facility (beyond our Ancram mill) may not be able to be mitigated by increased production at another.\nSignificant impairment charges could result from our evaluation of the Philippines RTL manufacturing site.\nThe Company suspended construction of its Philippines RTL manufacturing site during 2011. The carrying value of the partially constructed assets is evaluated for impairment at each reporting period by assessing the recoverability of the costs based on the undiscounted cash flows of the operation, the likelihood of its reactivation and any alternative uses for the equipment. This evaluation, along with potential declines in our RTL volumes, resulted in 2013 in an impairment of $37.2 million and could result in a decision to record a further impairment of some or a substantial portion of the net book value of the RTL Philippines property, plant and equipment, which was $30.8 million as of December 31, 2014.\nA failure of a key information technology system or process or other unusual events could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to analyze, process and manage transactions and data. We also rely heavily on the integrity of this data in managing our business. We or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be expensive, time-consuming and resource-intensive to remedy.\nNatural disasters, pandemics and other unusual events could interrupt one or more of our facilities in six different countries to varying degrees, which could adversely affect our results.\nWe rely on a limited number of key employees and may experience difficulty in retaining, attracting and hiring qualified new personnel in some areas of our business.\nThe loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business. Because several of our key products relate to the tobacco industry, we may experience difficulty in retaining and hiring qualified executives and other personnel. This may be caused by the health and social issues associated with the tobacco industry. The tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater acceptance. The loss of services of any key employees, including in our DelStar business, or our inability to attract, hire and retain personnel with requisite skills could restrict our ability to develop new products, enhance existing products in a timely manner, sell products or manage our business effectively. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends upon good relations with our employees.\nWe employ approximately 3,000 employees, including manufacturing employees represented by unions. Although we believe that employee and union relations are generally positive, there is no assurance that this will continue in the future. We may experience difficulties in maintaining appropriate relations with unions and employees in certain locations. We had a business interruption in one of our mills in late 2014. Problems or changes affecting employees in certain locations may affect relations with our employees at other locations. The risk of labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production could adversely affect us especially in conjunction with potential restructuring activities. If we cannot successfully negotiate or renegotiate collective bargaining agreements, or if negotiations take an excessive amount of time, there may be a heightened risk of work stoppages. Work stoppages may be caused by the inability of national unions and the governments of countries in which the Company operates from reaching agreement, and are outside the control of the Company. Any work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a manufacturing facility or on our operations as a whole as well as our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreases in costs of pension benefits may reduce our profitability.\nOur results of operations may be negatively affected by expenses we record for our defined benefit pension plans. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. We are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in increased funding obligations or negative changes in our stockholder equity. At the end of 2014, the combined projected benefit obligation of our U.S. and French pension and other postretirement healthcare plans was underfunded by $32.4 million. For a discussion regarding our pension obligations, see Note 16, Postretirement and Other Benefits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 and \"Other Factors Affecting Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Part II, Item 7. Although expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that affect expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to pension plans as required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) for U.S. plans. Failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets driven by various factors,\nwhich could include a continued environment of low interest rates or sustained market volatility, could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans.", "PERMNO": 82649, "SIC": 2621, "TIC": "SWM"}
