{"cik": "1171012", "company": "Uni-Pixel", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are certain risks and uncertainties relating to our business.\nYou should carefully consider the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business financial condition, operating results and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nExpansion into new markets may increase the complexity of our business, cause us to increase our research and development expenses to develop new products and technologies or cause our capital expenditures to increase, and if we are unable to successfully adapt our business processes and product offerings as required by these new markets, our ability to grow will be adversely affected.\nAs we expand our product lines to sell into new markets, such as automotive, the overall complexity of our business may increase at an accelerated rate and we may become subject to different market dynamics. These dynamics may include, among other things, different demand volume, seasonality, product requirements, sales channels, and warranty and return policies. In addition, expansion into other markets may result in increases in research and development expenses and substantial investments in manufacturing capability or technology enhancements. If we fail to successfully expand into new markets with products that we do not currently offer, we may lose business to our competitors or new entrants who offer these products.\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced solutions on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impaired, and our revenues and competitive position may be harmed.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards, all with an underlying pressure to reduce cost and meet stringent reliability and qualification requirements. In order to compete effectively, we must continually introduce new products or enhance existing products and accurately anticipate customer requirements for new and upgraded products. The introduction of new products by our competitors, the market acceptance of solutions based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future solutions obsolete. Our failure to anticipate or timely develop new or enhanced solutions or technologies in response to technological shifts or changes in customer requirements could result in decreased revenues and an increase in design wins by our competitors.\nNew product development or the enhancement of existing products is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. We may experience difficulties with solution design, manufacturing or otherwise that could delay or prevent the introduction of new or enhanced solutions. Alternatively, even if technical engineering hurdles can be overcome, we must successfully anticipate customer requirements regarding features and performance, the new or enhanced products must be competitively priced, and they must become available during the window of time when customers are ready to purchase our solutions.\nEven after new or enhanced products are developed, we must be able to successfully bring them to market. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Ramping of production capacity also entails risks of delays which can limit our ability to realize the full benefit of new product introduction. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced products successfully, if at all, or on a timely basis. Accordingly, we cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions, and any failure to manage new product introduction risks could adversely affect our revenues and therefore our business.\nWe are a company with a limited operating history, our future profitability is uncertain and we anticipate future losses and negative cash flow, which may limit or delay our ability to become profitable.\nWe are a company with a limited operating history and little revenues to date. We may never be able to produce material revenues or operate on a profitable basis. As a result, we have incurred losses since our inception and expect to experience operating losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated total deficit of $178.6 million.\nWe anticipate our losses will continue to increase from current levels because we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to prototype development, consulting costs, laboratory development costs, marketing and other promotional activities, the addition of engineering and manufacturing personnel, and the continued development of relationships with strategic business partners. Moreover, planned products based upon our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology may never become commercially viable and thus may never generate any revenues. Even if we find commercially viable applications for our Performance Engineered Film\u2122 technology and materials, we may never recover our research and development expenses.\nWe have had a history of losses and may require additional capital to fund our operations, which capital may not be available on commercially attractive terms, or at all.\nWe have experienced substantial net losses in each fiscal period since our inception. These net losses resulted from a lack of substantial revenues and the significant costs incurred in the development and acceptance of our technology. We may in the future require sources of capital in addition to cash on hand to continue operations and to implement our business plan. We project that we have sufficient liquid assets to continue operating for at least the next twelve months. However, if our operations do not become cash flow positive, we may be forced to seek credit line facilities from financial institutions, equity investments, or debt arrangements. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on reasonable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to adequately fund our business plan, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate the production of the XTouch Touch Sensors into our ongoing business operations, which may result in our inability to fully realize the intended benefits of the business combination and license transactions, or may disrupt our current operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity, prospects and/or results of operations.\nOn April 16, 2015, we acquired from Atmel Corporation the rights and capabilities to make XTouch Touch Sensors. We are in the process of integrating the production of the XTouch Touch Sensors into our business, and this process may absorb significant management attention, produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may not produce the favorable business and market opportunities the business combination and license transactions were intended to provide. If we fail to successfully integrate the XTouch business into our business, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of customers.\nWe have only recently begun generating revenues from a limited number of customers, and our customer concentration may change significantly from period-to-period depending on a customer\u2019s product cycle and changes in our industry. The loss of a customer, a reduction in net revenues of a customer for any reason, or a failure of a customer to fulfill its financial or other obligations due to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nAs a result of our limited operating history and the nature of the markets in which we compete, it is extremely difficult for us to forecast accurately. We base our current and future expense levels largely on our investment plans and estimates of future events, although certain of our expense levels are, to a large extent, fixed. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues relative to our planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we are subject to the following factors, among others, that may negatively affect and cause fluctuations in our operating results:\n\u25cf the timing of programs to our customers;\n\u25cf the announcement or introduction of new products or technologies by our competitors;\n\u25cf our ability to upgrade and develop our infrastructure to accommodate growth;\n\u25cf our ability to attract and retain key personnel in a timely and cost effective manner;\n\u25cf technical difficulties;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions as well as economic conditions specific to the touchscreen industry.\nFurther, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, we may from time to time make certain pricing, service, or marketing decisions that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Due to the foregoing factors, our revenues and operating results are and will remain difficult to forecast.\nWe are exposed to industry downturns and cyclicality in our target markets than may result in fluctuations in our operating results.\nThe PC and electronics industries have experienced significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, and production overcapacity. In addition, the PC and electronics industries are cyclical in nature. We seek to reduce our exposure to industry downturns and cyclicality by providing design and production services for leading companies in rapidly expanding industry segments. We may, however, experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy.\nIf we do not keep pace with technological innovations, our products may not remain competitive and our revenue and operating results may suffer.\nWe operate in rapidly changing highly competitive markets. Technological advances, the introduction of new products and new design techniques could adversely affect our business unless we are able to adapt to changing conditions. Technological advances could render our solutions less competitive or obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. Therefore, we will be required to expend substantial funds for, and commit significant resources to, enhancing and developing new technology which may include purchasing advanced design tools and test equipment, hiring additional highly qualified engineering and other technical personnel, and continuing and expanding research and development activities on existing and potential human interface solutions.\nOur research and development efforts with respect to new technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development stage to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive cost issues, yield problems, and other factors. Even if we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular technology, our customers may decide not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons, including difficulties with other suppliers of components for the products, superior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our solutions with these technologies, price considerations and lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors or customers develop and utilize new technologies more effectively or more quickly than we can. Any investments made to enhance or develop new technologies that are not successful could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe length of a customer\u2019s product development and release cycle depends on many factors outside of our control and could cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting revenues, or revenues that vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nThe development and release cycle for customer products is lengthy and unpredictable. OEMS and other customers often undertake significant evaluation and design in the qualification of our products, which contributes to a lengthy product release cycle. A customer\u2019s decision to purchase our technology often requires a lengthy approval process undertaken by several decision makers at the customer. The process requires us to make significant investments of time and resources before we can be sure that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or recover our investment. There is no assurance that a customer will adopt our technology after the evaluation or design phase, and we face the risk that our technology will fail to meet our customer\u2019s technical, performance or cost requirements, or that our products will be replaced by competitive products or alternative technological solutions. Even if our product is satisfactory to our customer, the customer may delay or terminate its product development efforts. The occurrence of any of these events could cause sales to not materialize, be deferred, or be cancelled, which would adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, the lengthy and variable development and release cycle for products may also have a negative impact on the timing of our revenues, causing our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nIf third parties infringe upon our intellectual property, we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury.\nExisting laws, contractual provisions and remedies afford only limited protection for our intellectual property. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Effective policing of the unauthorized use of our technology or intellectual property is difficult and litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is not only expensive, but time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and could divert attention of our management from operating the business. Intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to, among other things, the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in asserting our intellectual property rights. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our technology or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before they do so. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use. The unauthorized use of our technology or of our proprietary information by competitors could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our technology.\nThe laws of foreign countries may not provide protection of our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, which may make it more difficult for us to protect our intellectual property.\nAs part of our business strategy, we target customers and relationships with suppliers and original equipment manufacturers in countries with large populations and propensities for adopting new technologies. However, many of these countries do not address misappropriation of intellectual property nor deter others from developing similar, competing technologies or intellectual property. Effective protection of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. In particular, the laws of some foreign countries in which we do business may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent competitors in these regions from infringing our intellectual property rights, which could reduce our competitive advantage and ability to compete in those regions and negatively impact our business.\nAny claims that our technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties could result in significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other third party proprietary rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of resources, including the attention of management, and could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that the terms of any offered licenses would be acceptable to us. We may also have to pay substantial damages to third parties, or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violates any third party intellectual property rights. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or a failure to obtain necessary licenses to use such third-party technology could prevent us from manufacturing, using, or selling certain of our products, and there is no guarantee that we will able to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing technology.\nIn addition, we license certain technology used in and for our products from third parties. These third-party licenses are granted with restrictions, and there can be no assurances that such third-party technology will remain available to us on commercially acceptable terms.\nIf third-party technology currently utilized in our products is no longer available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or if any third party initiates litigation against us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, we may not be able to sell certain of our products and we could incur significant costs in defending against litigation or attempting to develop or acquire alternate non-infringing products, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide for indemnification of officers and directors in certain circumstances, which could require us to direct funds away from our business.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) contain provisions regarding indemnification and advancement of expenses actually and reasonably incurred by any person who is or was a party to a threatened, pending, or completed civil, criminal, administrative or investigative matter by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company, provided that such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reason or cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The advancement of expenses is expressly conditioned upon receipt of an undertaking by the director, officer, employee, or agent to repay all such amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. Funds so advanced or paid in fulfillment of our indemnification obligations (including satisfaction of defense costs, judgments, fines and expenses) may be funds we need for the operation and growth of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Debt\nRestrictive covenants under our credit facility with Western Alliance Bank may adversely affect our operations.\nIf we utilize our loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank, it contains a number of restrictive covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our ability to, without prior written consent from Western Alliance Bank:\n\u25cf\tConvey, sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of or permit any of the Company or its subsidiaries to transfer, all or any part of any of their business or property, other than: (i) transfers of inventory in the ordinary course of business; (ii) transfers of non- exclusive licenses and similar arrangements for the use of the property of the Company or its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business; or (iii) transfers of worn-out or obsolete equipment which was not financed by Western Alliance Bank;\n\u25cf\tMerge or consolidate, or permit any of the Company or its subsidiaries to merge or consolidate, with or into any other business organization, or acquire, or permit any of their subsidiaries to acquire, all or substantially all of the capital stock or property of another person or suffer or permit a change in control;\n\u25cf\tCreate, incur, assume or be or remain liable with respect to any indebtedness, or permit any of their subsidiaries so to do, other than indebtedness permitted under the loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank;\n\u25cf\tCreate, incur, assume or suffer to exist any lien with respect to any of the property of either of them (including without limitation, their intellectual property), other than liens permitted under the loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank;\n\u25cf\tPay any dividends or make any other distribution or payment on account of or in redemption, retirement or purchase of any capital stock, or permit any of their subsidiaries to do so other than as permitted under the loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank;\n\u25cf\tDirectly or indirectly acquire or own, or make any investment in or to any person, or permit any of their subsidiaries so to do, other than investments permitted under the loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank;\n\u25cf\tMake or contract to make, without Western Alliance Bank\u2019s prior written consent, capital expenditures (including leasehold improvements) or incur liability for rentals of property (including both real and personal property) in an aggregate amount in any fiscal year in excess of $500,000; and\n\u25cf\tMake any material changes to the Company\u2019s organizational structure or identity.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock, Warrants and Preferred Stock\nOur Common Stock has experienced significant price and volume volatility, which substantially increases the risk of loss to persons owning our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock, which trades on The NASDAQ Capital Market, has had a price range as low as $0.48 and as high as $7.70 during the period from January 1, 2015 through March 15, 2017. In addition, the markets for high technology stocks have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of the particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nThe value of an investment in our Common Stock could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our Common Stock:\n\u25cf Disappointing results from our development efforts;\n\u25cf Failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget;\n\u25cf Decline in demand for our Common Stock;\n\u25cf Downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates or changes in general market conditions;\n\u25cf Technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies;\n\u25cf Investor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u25cf General economic trends;\n\u25cf Variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf Our inability to increase revenues:\n\u25cf Announcement of new customer relationships by our competitors;\n\u25cf Departures of our executive officers;\n\u25cf General conditions in the economy, including fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u25cf Developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;\n\u25cf Developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers;\n\u25cf Any significant acts of terrorism against the United States; and\n\u25cf Our currently limited public float.\nThe market price of our Common Stock has been volatile, and the value of stockholders\u2019 investments could decline significantly.\nThe trading price for our Common Stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. The price at which our Common Stock trades depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, customer and vendor relationships, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms on which we raise it, changes in earnings estimates by analysts and general market and economic conditions. Further, broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our Common Stock and affect our trading volume.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants and options, and future sales of the underlying shares of Common Stock could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nAs of March 15, 2017, we had outstanding warrants and options exercisable for an aggregate of 23,703,872 shares of Common Stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.46 per share. Upon exercise of these warrants or options, we would issue additional shares of our Common Stock. As a result, our current stockholders as a group would own a substantially smaller interest in us and may have less influence on our management and policies than they now have. Furthermore, the holders may sell these shares in the public markets from time to time, without limitations on the timing, amount or method of sale. As our stock price rises, the holders may exercise more of their warrants and options and sell a large number of shares. This could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline.\nWe issued warrants in November 2015, of which 14,558,468 are outstanding as of March 15, 2017 and have an exercise price of $0.95 per share (as adjusted for the issuance and sale of our Common Stock and warrants on February 15, 2017) and have a term of five (5) years from the date of issuance. The exercise price of the warrants and the number of shares of Common Stock for which the warrants are exercisable are subject to certain adjustments if we issue or sell additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents at a price per share less than the exercise price then in effect (which is now $0.95 per share), or without consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there will be no adjustment to the exercise price of these warrants or number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise in connection with the issuance of Common Stock upon Board of Director-approved employee benefit plans or upon the conversion, exercise or payment of certain outstanding, excluded securities.\nIn January 2017, we issued warrants covering 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock that have an exercise price of $1.50 per share, are exercisable six (6) months after issuance (the \u201cInitial Exercisability Date\u201d) and a term of five (5) years from the Initial Exercisability Date. The exercise price of such warrants are subject to a one-time adjustment on the Initial Exercisability Date to an amount no less than $1.26 per share. In addition, if on the Initial Exercisability Date, the exercise price of the warrants, as adjusted pursuant to their terms, exceeds 93% of the lowest volume-weighted average price of our Common Stock on NASDAQ for any trading day during trading hours and as reported by Bloomberg commencing on the date of issuance of the warrants and including the trading day immediately prior to the Initial Exercisability Date (the \u201cMarket Price\u201d), the exercise price of the warrants shall be adjusted to such Market Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise price of the warrants shall not be adjusted to an amount less than $1.26 per share, unless and until such time as the Company obtains approval of its stockholders to the transactions contemplated by the warrant documents.\nIn February 2017, we issued warrants covering 4,738,500 shares of Common Stock that are exercisable, have an exercise price of $1.00 per share and have a term of five (5) years from the date of issuance. A holder may not exercise such warrant and we may not issue shares of Common Stock under such warrant if, after giving effect to the exercise or issuance, the holder together with its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. At each holder\u2019s option, the cap may be increased or decreased to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99%, except that any increase will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after notice to us. The holders of such warrants are entitled to acquire options, convertible securities or rights to purchase our securities or property granted, issued or sold pro rata to the holders of our Common Stock on an \u201cas if exercised for Common Stock\u201d basis. The holders of such warrants are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution of our assets (or rights to acquire our assets), on an \u201cas if exercised for Common Stock\u201d basis. Furthermore, such warrants prohibit us from entering into transactions constituting a \u201cfundamental transaction\u201d (as defined in such warrants) unless the successor entity assumes all of our obligations under such warrants and the other transaction documents in a written agreement approved by the \u201crequired holders\u201d of such warrants. The definition of \u201cfundamental transactions\u201d includes, but is not limited to, mergers, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, certain tender offers and other transactions that result in a change of control.\nThere is no public market for our warrants.\nThere is no established public trading market for any of our warrants, and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply for listing of any of our warrants on any national securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system. Without an active market, the liquidity of our warrants will be limited.\nHolders of our warrants will have no rights as a common stockholder until such holders exercise their warrants and acquire our Common Stock.\nUntil holders of our warrants acquire shares of our Common Stock upon exercise of such warrants, holders of our warrants will have no rights with respect to the shares of our Common Stock underlying such warrants. Upon exercise of our warrants, the holders thereof will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.\nWe have shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, which are convertible into shares of our Common Stock, currently outstanding. Their conversion will cause dilution to existing and new stockholders.\nThe Certificate of Designations of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series A-1 Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A-1 Certificate of Designations\u201d) provides that our shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A-1 Preferred Stock\u201d) are convertible into one share of Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.50 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations or similar events. Each holder also has the additional right ninety (90) days after issuance of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock to convert the Series A-1 Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at that price which is the lower of (i) the conversion price then in effect and (ii) the greater of (A) $0.35 and (B) 93% of the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the time of the delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable conversion notice. Currently, all 3,000 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock are outstanding. All conversions are subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations.\nThe Series A-1 Certificate of Designations also contain certain triggering events including but not limited to: (i) the suspension from trading or failure of the Common Stock to be trading or listed (as applicable) on a national securities exchange for a period of five (5) consecutive trading days, and (ii) the failure of the Company to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock or to make payments when due under the Series A-1 Certificate of Designations. At any time a triggering event has occurred through the earlier of (x) the date of the cure of such triggering event and (y) the 20th trading day after the Company has delivered written notice to such holder of such triggering event, each holder may convert its Series A-1 Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at that price which is defined as that price which is the lower of (i) the conversion price then in effect and (ii) the greater of (A) $0.35 and (B) the higher of (I) 85% of the lowest volume weighted average price of the Common Stock on any trading day during the five (5) consecutive trading day period ending and including the trading day immediately preceding the delivery of the applicable conversion notice and (II) $0.35.\nThe Series A-1 Certificate of Designations also provides that, subject to the satisfaction of customary equity conditions and the beneficial ownership limitations, at any time the volume weighted average price of our Common Stock is greater than or equal to $1.50 per share, the Company may, by written notice, require each holder to convert up to its pro rata share of 20% of the aggregate dollar trading volume (as reported on Bloomberg, LP) of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market over the ten (10) consecutive trading day period immediately prior to the date of notice of such mandatory conversion.\nThe conversion of our outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock into Common Stock would dilute the then-existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership of Common Stock, and any sales in the public market of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Common Stock.\nOur shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock may be subject to cash redemption, which would decrease the capital available for our business.\nThe Series A-1 Certificate of Designations provides that at any time on or after January 20, 2018, if the Series A-1 Preferred Stock has not yet been converted into shares of our Common Stock, we may be required, at the option of each holder, to redeem the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in cash, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 125% of the stated value of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock being redeemed and the intrinsic value of the shares of the Common Stock then issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock being redeemed. Alternatively, if a triggering event occurs, each holder may require us (in lieu of requiring us to convert as described above) to redeem all or any number of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, in cash, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 125% of the $1,000 stated value of each such share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock being redeemed and (ii) the intrinsic value of the shares of the Common Stock then issuable upon conversion of such shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock being redeemed (without regard to any limitations on conversion in the Series A-1 Certificate of Designations). If we did not have the cash necessary to redeem the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the holder of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock may cancel the redemption and instead have dividends, which are also convertible, on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock increase, and the conversion price of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock adjust.\nIn addition, at our option, we may redeem the Series A-1 Preferred Stock at any time, in cash, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 125% of the stated value of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock being redeemed and the intrinsic value of the shares of the Common Stock then issuable upon conversion of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock being redeemed.\nOur shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock are entitled to certain rights, privileges and preferences over our Common Stock, including a preference upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our Company, which will reduce amounts available for distribution to the holders of our Common Stock.\nThe holders of our shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock are entitled to payment, prior to payment to the holders of Common Stock in the event of liquidation of the Company. If we are dissolved, liquidated or wound up at a time when the Series A-1 Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive only an amount equal to the liquidation preference (as it may be adjusted from time to time), plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, to the extent that we have funds legally available. Any remaining assets will be distributable to holders of our other equity securities.\nShares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock will generally have no voting rights, except as required by law and except that the consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock will be required to amend any provision of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation that would have a materially adverse effect on the rights of the holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and as otherwise specified in the Series A-1 Certificate of Designations.\nOur Common Stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, or NASDAQ.\nIn order to maintain continued inclusion of our Common Stock for trading on NASDAQ, we are required to maintain a minimum $1.00 per share bid price for our Common Stock. If the bid price of our Common Stock is below $1.00 for an extended period, or we are unable to continue to meet NASDAQ\u2019s listing maintenance standards for any other reason, our Common Stock could be delisted from NASDAQ. On March 15, 2017, the last reported sale price of our Common Stock on NASDAQ was $0.90 per share.\nIf our Common Stock is delisted from NASDAQ, we will make every possible effort to have it listed on the OTCQX Market (the \u201cOTCQX\u201d). If our Common Stock was to be traded on the OTCQX, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and related SEC rules would impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell our securities. These rules may adversely affect your ability to sell our Common Stock and otherwise negatively affect the liquidity, trading market and price of our Common Stock.\nIf our Common Stock would not be able to be traded on the OTCQX or on another over-the-counter market, the OTCQB, we expect that our Common Stock would be eligible to be quoted on the OTC Markets Group\u2019s OTC Pink platform (the \u201cOTC Pink\u201d). The OTC Pink securities market consists of security firms who act as market makers in the stocks, usually, of very small companies. The OTC Pink is a significantly more limited market than NASDAQ, and the quotation of our Common Stock on the OTC Pink may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade our Common Stock and could further depress the trading price of our Common Stock.\nAs discussed above, the delisting of our Common Stock from NASDAQ (or such other national securities exchange) for a period of five (5) consecutive trading days or more constitutes a triggering event under our Series A-1 Certificate of Designations and would allow the holders of Series A-1 Preferred Stock to convert their shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at a price which is the lower of (i) the conversion price then in effect and (ii) the greater of (A) $0.35 and (B) the higher of (I) 85% of the lowest volume weighted average price of the Common Stock on any trading day during the five (5) consecutive trading day period ending and including the trading day immediately preceding the delivery of the applicable conversion notice and (II) $0.35. Furthermore, an equity condition failure would occur if delisting from NASDAQ (or such other national securities exchange) has reasonably been threatened by NASDAQ (or such other national securities exchange) or suspension of our Common Stock listing has occurred (other than suspensions of not more than two (2) days and due to a business announcements by us). The existence of an equity condition failure will prevent us from being able to exercise our right to mandatory conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock into shares of our Common Stock.\nWe believe that the listing of our Common Stock on a recognized national trading market, such as NASDAQ, is an important part of our business and strategy. Such a listing helps our stockholders by providing a readily available trading market with current quotations. Without such a listing, the sale or purchase of our Common Stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our Common Stock would likely decline. Furthermore, a delisting from NASDAQ would result in negative publicity and would negatively impact our ability to raise capital in the future.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of Common Stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six (6) months subject only to the current public information requirement (which disappears after one (1) year). Affiliates may sell after six (6) months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), current public information and notice requirements. Of the 45,122,841 shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016, approximately 44.2 million shares are held by non- \u201caffiliates\u201d and are, or will be, freely tradable without restriction, and the remaining shares are held by our \u201caffiliates\u201d, as of such date. Any substantial sale of our Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nFuture sales of our Common Stock or preferred stock by us could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, and our future capital- raising activities could involve the issuance of equity securities, which could result in a decline in the trading price of our Common Stock.\nOur long-term success is dependent on us obtaining sufficient capital to fund our operations and to develop our technology, and bringing our technology to the worldwide market to obtain sufficient sales volume to be profitable. We may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock or preferred stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and our ability to raise capital. We may issue additional Common Stock or preferred stock in future financing transactions or as incentive compensation for our executive management and other key personnel, consultants and advisors. Issuing any equity securities would be dilutive to the equity interests represented by our then-outstanding shares of Common Stock. The market price for our Common Stock could decrease as the market takes into account the dilutive effect of any of these issuances. Furthermore, we may enter into financing transactions at prices that represent a substantial discount to the market price of our Common Stock. A negative reaction by investors and securities analysts to any discounted sale of our equity securities could result in a decline in the trading price our Common Stock.\nWe may be required to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our existing stockholders, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and our business.\nWe may require additional financing to fund future operations, including expansion in current and new markets, development and acquisition, capital costs and the costs of any necessary implementation of technological innovations or alternative technologies. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing Common Stock or preferred stock, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced, and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of Common Stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and the voting power of shares of our Common Stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior to those of the holders of shares of Common Stock, and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock, and have no plans to pay dividends for our Common Stock or preferred stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain earnings, if any, to develop and expand our business operations.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. These provisions:\n\u25cf authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for nominations to the board of directors or for proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf do not provide for cumulative voting rights; and\n\u25cf provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally limits our ability to engage in any business combination with certain persons who own 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or any of our associates or affiliates who at any time in the past three years have owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12496, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "UNXLQ"}
