{"cik": "821483", "company": "PAR PETROLEUM CORP/CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur businesses involve a high degree of risk. You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report, actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In any such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect us.\nOperating Risks\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards that could expose us to potentially significant losses.\nOur operations are subject to potential operational hazards and risks inherent in refining operations, in transporting and storing crude oil and refined products and in producing natural gas and oil. Any of these risks, such as fires, explosions, maritime disasters, security breaches, pipeline ruptures and spills, mechanical failure of equipment, and severe weather and natural disasters, at our or third-party facilities could result in business interruptions or shutdowns and damage to our properties and the properties of others. A serious accident at our facilities could also result in serious injury or death to our employees or contractors and could expose us to significant liability for personal injury claims and reputational risk. Any such event or unplanned shutdown could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe volatility of crude oil prices and refined product prices may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations.\nEarnings and cash flows from our refining, distribution and marketing segment depend on a number of factors, including to a large extent the cost of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks which has fluctuated significantly in recent years. While prices for refined products are influenced by the price of crude oil, the constantly changing margin between the price we pay for crude oil and other refinery feedstocks and the prices we receive for refined products (\u201ccrack spread\u201d) also fluctuates significantly. These prices we pay and prices we receive depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the global supply and demand for crude oil, gasoline and other refined products, which are subject to, among other things:\n\u2022\nchanges in the global economy and the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products;\n\u2022\navailability of crude oil and refined products and the infrastructure to transport crude oil and refined products;\n\u2022\nlocal factors, including market conditions, the level of operations of other refineries in our markets, and the volume and price of refined products imported;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual terrorist incidents, acts of war, and other global political conditions;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations; and\n\u2022\nweather conditions, hurricanes or other natural disasters.\nIn addition, we purchase our refinery feedstocks before manufacturing and selling the refined products. Price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the manufactured refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant impact on our financial results. We also purchase refined products manufactured by others for sale to our customers. Price level changes during the periods between purchasing and selling these refined products could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our refined products could cause serious injury or death if mishandled or misused by us or our purchasers, or if defects occur during manufacturing.\nWhile we produce, store, transport and deliver all of our refined products in a safe manner, many of our refined products are highly flammable or explosive and could cause significant damage to persons or property if mishandled. Defects in our products (such as gasoline or jet fuel) or misuse by us or by end purchasers could lead to fatalities or serious damage to property. We may be held liable for such occurrences which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business is impacted by environmental risks of spills, discharges or other releases of petroleum or hazardous substances that are inherent in refining, logistics and production operations.\nThe operation of refineries, pipelines, and refined products terminals and the production of natural gas and oil is inherently subject to the risks of spills, discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances. These events could occur in connection with the operation of our refinery, pipelines, or refined products terminals, or in connection with our commodity marketing and logistics segment, or our drilling and production activities or any facilities which receive our waste or by-products for treatment or disposal. If any of these events occur, or is found to have previously occurred, we could be liable for costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal, state and local environmental laws or common law, and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills. The penalties and clean-up costs that we may have to pay for releases or the amounts that we may have to pay to third parties for damages to their property, could be significant and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in and adjacent to environmentally sensitive coastal waters where tanker, pipeline, and refined product transportation and storage operations are closely regulated by federal, state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups. Transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves inherent risk and subjects us to the provisions of the Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and state laws in Hawaii. Among other things, these laws require us and the owners of tankers that we charter to deliver crude oil to our refinery to demonstrate in some situations the capacity to respond to a spill of up to one million barrels of oil from a tanker and up to 600,000 barrels of oil from an above ground storage tank adjacent to water, which we refer to as a \u201cWorst Case Discharge,\u201d to the maximum extent possible.\nWe and the owners of tankers we charter have contracted with various spill response service companies in the areas in which we transport and store crude oil and refined products to meet the requirements of the Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and state and foreign laws. However, there may be accidents involving tankers, pipelines, or above ground storage tanks transporting or storing crude oil or refined products, and response services may not respond to a Worst Case Discharge in a manner that will adequately contain that discharge, or we may be subject to liability in connection with a discharge. Additionally, we cannot ensure that all resources of a contracted response service company could be available for our or a chartered tanker owner\u2019s use at any\ngiven time. There are many factors that could inhibit the availability of these resources, including, but not limited to, weather conditions, governmental regulations or other global events. By requirement of state or federal rulings, these resources could be diverted to respond to other global events.\nOur operations, including the operation of underground storage tanks, are also subject to the risk of environmental litigation and investigations which could affect our results of operations.\nFrom time to time we have been, and presently are, subject to litigation and investigations with respect to environmental and related matters. We may become involved in further litigation or other proceedings, or we may be held responsible in any existing or future litigation or proceedings, the costs of which could be material.\nWe operate and have in the past operated retail stations with underground storage tanks in Hawaii. Federal and state regulations and legislation govern the storage tanks, and compliance with these requirements can be costly. The operation of underground storage tanks poses certain risks, including leaks. Leaks from underground storage tanks, which may occur at one or more of our retail stations, may impact soil or groundwater and could result in fines or civil liability for us.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from the liabilities that could arise in our business.\nWe carry property, casualty, business interruption and other lines of insurance but we do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses. Marine vessel charter agreements do not include indemnity provisions for oil spills so we also carry marine charterer\u2019s liability insurance. We could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material. Insurance policies are also subject to compliance with certain conditions, the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy. There also can be no assurance that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance or failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and refined products.\nOur refinery currently receives its crude oil via tankers and transports refined products from Oahu to Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai. In addition to environmental risks, we could experience an interruption of supply or an increased cost to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of accidents, governmental regulation or third-party action. A prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business, and the failure of any critical information system, including a cyber-security breach, may result in harm to our business.\nWe are heavily dependent on our technology infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include data network and telecommunications, internet access and our websites, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications, including those that are critical to the safe operation of our refinery and our pipelines and terminals. These information systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks, and other events. To the extent that these information systems are under our control, we have implemented measures such as virus protection software and intrusion detection systems, to address the outlined risks. However, security measures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe. Any compromise of our data security or our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business and subject us to additional costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Finally, federal legislation relating to cyber-security threats could impose additional requirements on our operations.\nEvents outside the United States could create operating risks.\nUnited States embargoes or restrictive actions by U.S. and foreign governments could limit our ability to purchase crude oil and buy and sell petroleum products. Changes in, or the imposition of, withholding or other taxes on foreign income, tariffs or restriction on foreign trade and investment, political instability, war and civil disturbances or other events such as terrorist attacks, piracy and kidnapping may limit or disrupt markets, could negatively impact our ability to purchase crude oil or sell our refined products.\nThrough Piceance Energy, we are subject to all the risks of natural gas and oil exploration and production.\nAlthough we are a non-operator, through our investment in Piceance Energy, and to a lesser extent, our other non-operated properties, we are exposed to all the risks inherent in natural gas and oil exploration and production, including the risks that:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to replace production with new reserves;\n\u2022\nexploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves;\n\u2022\ntitle to properties in which we or Piceance Energy has an interest may be impaired by title defects;\n\u2022\nthe marketability of our natural gas products depends mostly on the availability, proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities, which are owned by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe have no long-term contracts to sell natural gas or oil;\n\u2022\nfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays;\n\u2022\nnatural gas drilling and production operations require adequate sources of water to facilitate the fracturing process and the disposal of that water when it flows back to the wellbore. If we are unable to obtain adequate water supplies and dispose of the water we use or remove at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules, our ability to produce natural gas commercially and in commercial quantities would be impaired.\nWe cannot control activities on properties we do not operate and we are unable to ensure the proper operation and profitability of these non-operated properties.\nWe are a non-operator with respect to our natural gas and oil properties. Consequently, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operation of these properties. The success and timing of leasehold acquisition, drilling and development activities therefore will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\ntiming and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpertise and diligence in adequately performing operations and complying with applicable agreements;\n\u2022\nfinancial resources;\n\u2022\ninclusion of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022\nuse of technology.\nAs a result of any of the above or other failure of the operator to act in ways that are in our best interest, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to extract value from our investment in Piceance Energy is limited.\nOur 33.34% ownership interest in Piceance Energy is a significant asset. However, the ability of Piceance Energy to make distributions to its owners, including us, is currently prohibited by the terms of the Piceance Energy Credit Facility. In addition, Laramie, which owns the remaining 66.66% ownership interest in Piceance Energy, controls most decisions affecting Piceance Energy\u2019s operations and we only have veto rights over decisions of Piceance Energy in a limited number of areas.\nInformation concerning our natural gas and oil reserves is uncertain.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and cash flows from such reserves, including factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of natural gas and oil reserves, or of cash flows attributable to such reserves, is a function of the available data, assumptions regarding future natural gas and oil prices, availability and terms of financing, expenditures for future development and exploitation activities, and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Reserves and future cash flows may also be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history, development and exploitation activities, natural gas and oil prices and regulatory changes. Actual future production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, quantities of recoverable reserves and value of cash flows from those reserves may vary significantly from our assumptions and estimates. In addition, reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data. Further, the difficult financing environment may inhibit our ability to finance development of our reserves in the future.\nThe estimated quantities of proved reserves and the discounted present value of future net cash flows attributable to those reserves as of December 31, 2014 included herein were prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with the rules of the SEC, and are not intended to represent the fair market value of such reserves. As required by the SEC, the estimated discounted present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves is generally based on prices and costs on the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. In addition, the 10% discount factor the SEC requires to be used\nto calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the natural gas and oil industry in general.\nOur commodity marketing and logistics segment's cash flows may be impacted by reduced shipping capacity on the Express Pipeline System.\nOur commodity marketing and logistics segment is primarily focused on the domestic merchandising and transportation of crude oil, and uses a variety of transportation modes, including pipelines. For the transportation of crude oil from Western Canada into the United States, we have maintained historical shipper capacity on certain common carrier pipelines regulated by the National Energy Board in Canada and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the United States. We and other similarly situated shippers have been informed from time to time that our capacity rights may be reduced below historical levels in light of certain contractually committed volume on such pipelines. To the extent such pipelines are successful in reducing our historical shipping capacity, our cash flows may be negatively impacted.\nRegulatory Risk\nMeeting the requirements of evolving environmental, health and safety laws and regulations including those related to climate change could adversely affect our performance.\nConsistent with the experience of other U.S. refiners, environmental laws and regulations have raised operating costs and may require significant capital investments at our refinery. We may be required to address conditions that may be discovered in the future and require a response. Also, potentially material expenditures could be required in the future as a result of evolving environmental, health and safety, and energy laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Future developments in federal and state laws and regulations governing environmental, health and safety and energy matters are especially difficult to predict.\nPrior to our acquisition of HIE, Tesoro was engaged in negotiations with the EPA regarding a Consent Decree related to all of Tesoro\u2019s refining assets, including HIE. While Tesoro has agreed to reimburse us for capital expenditures arising from the Consent Decree, HIE will continue to be initially liable for capital expenditures and will be responsible for any operational expense increases brought about by the Consent Decree.\nCurrently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of consideration, promulgation or implementation. These include actions to develop national, statewide or regional programs, each of which could require reductions in our GHG emissions. Requiring reductions in our GHG emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and/or (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.\nRequiring reductions in our GHG emissions and increased use of renewable fuels which can be supplied by producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual customers could also decrease the demand for our refined products, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential legislative and regulatory actions addressing climate change could increase our costs, reduce our revenue and cash flow from natural gas and oil sales or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business.\nFuture changes in the laws and regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult or expensive to conduct our operations and may have other adverse effects on us. For example, the EPA has issued a notice of finding and determination that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHG present an endangerment to human health and the environment, which allows the EPA to begin regulating GHG emissions under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (\"CAA\"). The EPA has begun to implement GHG-related reporting and permitting rules. Similarly, the U.S. Congress has considered and may in the future consider \u201ccap and trade\u201d legislation that would establish an economy-wide cap on GHG emissions in the United States and would require most sources of GHG emissions to obtain emission \u201callowances\u201d corresponding to their annual GHG emissions. For those GHG sources that are unable to meet the required limitations, such legislation could impose substantial financial burdens. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce GHG emissions would likely require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our production.\nThe adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to manage risks associated with our businesses and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including oil and natural gas derivative transactions. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for the creation of position limits for certain derivatives transactions, as well as requiring certain transactions to be cleared on exchanges for which cash collateral will be required. In October 2011, the CFTC approved final rules that establish position limits for futures contracts on 28 physical commodities, including four energy commodities, and swaps, futures and options that are economically equivalent to those contracts. The rules provide an exemption for \u201cbona fide hedging\u201d transactions or positions, but this exemption is narrower than the exemption under existing CFTC position limit rules. These newly approved CFTC position limits rules were vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nIt is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules on us and the timing of such effects. The Dodd-Frank Act may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements if we do not satisfy certain specific exceptions. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require the counter-parties to our derivatives contracts to transfer or assign some of their derivatives contracts to a separate entity, which may not be as credit-worthy as the current counter-party. Depending on the rules adopted by the CFTC or similar rules that may be adopted by other regulatory bodies, we might in the future be required to provide cash collateral for our commodities derivative transactions under circumstances in which we do not currently post cash collateral. Posting of such additional cash collateral could impact liquidity and reduce our cash available for capital expenditures. A requirement to post cash collateral could therefore reduce our ability to execute transactions to reduce commodity price uncertainty and thus protect cash flows. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable.\nBusiness Risks\nThe location of our refinery and related assets in the Hawaiian Islands creates an exposure to the risks of the local economy in which we operate and other local adverse conditions. The location of our refinery also creates the risk of lower margins should the supply/demand balance change in the Hawaiian Islands requiring that we deliver refined products to customers outside of the region.\nBecause our refinery is located on the Hawaiian Island of Oahu, we primarily market our refined products in the Hawaiian Islands, which is a relatively limited geographic area. As a result, we are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and any unforeseen events or circumstances that affect our operating area could also materially adversely affect our revenues and our ability to make distributions. These factors include, among other things, changes in the economy, weather conditions, demographics and population, increased supply of refined products from competitors and reductions in the supply of crude oil.\nShould the supply/demand balance shift in the Hawaiian Islands, resulting in supply in the region exceeding demand, we may have to deliver refined products to customers outside of the region, resulting in lower margins.\nAs with any refinery of our size and complexity, we must make substantial capital expenditures at our refinery and related assets to maintain their reliability and efficiency. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs or in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nDelays or cost increases related to the engineering, procurement and construction of new facilities, or improvements and repairs to our existing facilities and equipment, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors in the marketplace, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndenial or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals and/or permits;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in executing the capital projects mandated by the consent decree currently being negotiated by Tesoro;\n\u2022\nunplanned increases in the cost of equipment, materials or labor;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in transportation of equipment and materials;\n\u2022\nsevere adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of our vendors and suppliers;\n\u2022\nshortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;\n\u2022\nmarket-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and/or\n\u2022\nnon-performance or force majeure by, or disputes with, our vendors, suppliers, contractors or sub-contractors.\nOur refinery and related assets have been in operation for many years. Equipment, even if properly maintained, may require significant capital expenditures and expenses to keep it operating at optimum efficiency. These costs do not result in increases in unit capacities, but rather are focused on trying to maintain safe, reliable operations.\nAny one or more of these occurrences noted above could have a significant impact on our business. If we were unable to make up the delays or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our financial position, or results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to obtain our crude oil supply without the benefit of our supply and exchange agreements or similar agreements, the capital required to finance our crude oil supply could seriously hamper our liquidity.\nSubstantially all of the crude oil delivered at the refinery is handled through our supply and exchange agreements with Barclays independent of whether crude oil is sourced from our suppliers or from Barclays directly. If we are unable to obtain our crude oil supply through the supply and exchange agreements or similar agreements, our exposure to crude oil pricing risks may increase as the number of days between when we pay for the crude oil and when the crude oil is delivered to us increases. Such increased exposure could negatively impact our liquidity position due to our increased working capital needs as a result of the increase in the value of crude oil inventory we would have to carry on our balance sheet.\nOur retail business is vulnerable to risks including changes in consumer preferences and economic conditions, competitive environment, supplier concentration and other trends and factors that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur retail business is subject to changes in consumer preferences, national, regional and local economic conditions, demographic trends and consumer confidence in the economy. Factors such as traffic patterns, weather conditions, local demographics and the number and locations of competing retail service stations and convenience stores also affect the performance of our retail stores. Adverse changes in any of these trends or factors could reduce our retail customer traffic or sales, or impose limits on our pricing that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our net operating loss tax carryforwards will continue to be available to offset our tax liability.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we estimated that we had approximately $1.4 billion of net operating loss tax carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d). In order to utilize the NOLs, we must generate taxable income that can offset such carryforwards. The availability of NOLs to offset taxable income would be substantially reduced or eliminated if we were to undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). We will be treated as having had an \u201cownership change\u201d if there is more than a 50% increase in stock ownership during any three year \u201ctesting period\u201d by \u201c5% shareholders.\u201d\nIn order to help us preserve our NOLs, our certificate of incorporation contains stock transfer restrictions designed to reduce the risk of an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. We expect that the restrictions will remain in place for the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you, however, that these restrictions will prevent an ownership change.\nThe NOLs will expire in various amounts, if not used, between 2027 through 2033. The Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) has not audited any of our tax returns for any of the years during the carryforward period including those returns for the years in which the losses giving rise to the NOLs were reported. We cannot assure you that we would prevail if the IRS were to challenge the availability of the NOLs. If the IRS were successful in challenging our NOLs, all or some portion of the NOLs would not be available to offset any future consolidated income which would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nInadequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business operations in the future.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our obligations, we may be forced to reduce our capital expenditures, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be affected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our liquidity is constrained by our need to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements and our supply and exchange agreements. The availability of capital when the need arises will depend upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include general economic and financial market conditions, the crack spread, natural gas and oil prices, our credit ratings, interest rates, market perceptions of us or the\nindustries in which we operate, our market value and our operating performance. We may be unable to execute our long-term operating strategy if we cannot obtain capital from these sources when the need arises.\nOur ability to generate cash and repay our indebtedness or fund capital expenditures depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to fund future capital expenditures and repay our indebtedness when due will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, borrowings under our debt agreements and distributions from our subsidiaries. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory conditions and other factors that are beyond our control, including the crack spread and the prices we receive for our natural gas and oil production.\nWe cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that our subsidiaries can or will make sufficient distributions to us or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to repay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our needs, we may be forced to reduce our planned capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be affected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our liquidity.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nWe have, and will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. Our obligation to repay our existing indebtedness will limit our ability to use our capital for other purposes. We may also incur additional debt, including secured indebtedness, or issue preferred stock in order to maintain adequate liquidity and develop our businesses to the extent desired. A higher level of indebtedness and/or the issuance of preferred stock would increase the risk that we may default on our obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, the crack spread, natural gas and oil prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of securities or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital.\nOur variable rate debt subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nWe will be subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under certain of our credit facilities, which bear interest at variable rates. Interest rate changes will not affect the market value of any debt incurred under such facilities, but could affect the amount of our interest payments, and accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. A significant increase in prevailing interest rates that results in a substantial increase in the interest rates applicable to our indebtedness could substantially increase our interest expense and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely impact our ability to incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes.\nWe have historically incurred debt to fund our acquisitions and other working capital needs. Interest rates may increase in the future and, as a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. A rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact, as a result of such increased financing costs, on our ability to incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes.\nWe may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate future acquisitions which may negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe will continue to pursue acquisitions in the future. Although we regularly engage in discussions with, and submit proposals to, acquisition candidates, suitable acquisitions may not be available in the future on reasonable terms. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition, finance the acquisition or, if the acquisition occurs, effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing businesses. Negotiations of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired business operations may require a disproportionate amount of management\u2019s attention and our resources. Even if we complete additional acquisitions, continued acquisition financing may not be available or available on reasonable terms, any new businesses may not generate the anticipated level of revenues, the anticipated cost efficiencies or synergies may not be realized and these businesses may not be integrated successfully or operated profitably. Our inability to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate future acquisitions may negatively affect our results of operations.\nCompetition from integrated national and international oil companies that produce their own supply of feedstocks, from importers of refined products and from high volume retailers and large convenience store retailing operators who may have greater financial resources, could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of these competitors may have access to greater financial resources, which may provide them with a better ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. Fundamental changes in the supply dynamics of foreign product imports could lead to reduced margins for the refined products we market, which could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our fuel retailing business.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively with larger companies for acquisitions, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe industries in which we operate are intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources than we have. Our ability to acquire additional businesses or properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable businesses or properties for acquisition and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Many of our larger competitors have refining operations and market petroleum and other products and explore for and produce natural gas and oil, on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for acquisition targets, or evaluate or bid for and purchase a greater number of acquisition targets than our resources permit. Our inability to compete effectively with larger companies for acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our refining workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 577 people, with a collective bargaining agreement covering about 132 of those employees. The collective bargaining agreement covering our refinery employees expired in January 2015 and during our negotiations with the United Steelworkers Union, the represented employees have continued to work under the terms of the existing agreement on a 24-hour rolling extension. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent a strike or work stoppage in the future, and any such work stoppage could cause disruptions in our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our companies have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nAdverse changes in global economic conditions and the demand for transportation fuels may impact our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nThe economic recovery from the recent recession continues to be tenuous, and the risk of further significant global economic downturn continues. Further prolonged downturns or failure to recover could result in declines in consumer and business confidence and spending as well as increased unemployment and reduced demand for transportation fuels. This continues to adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate. These conditions increase the risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers, customers and business partners. The consequences of such adverse effects could include interruptions or delays in our suppliers\u2019 performance of our contracts, reductions and delays in customer purchases, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products, and bankruptcy of customers. Any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition.\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us.\nWe may be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to the company\u2019s operations and may cause significant expenditures and diversion of management attention. We may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could materially adversely affect our business operations or materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters.\nCompetition from integrated national and international oil companies that produce their own supply of feedstocks, from importers of refined products and from high volume retailers and large convenience store retailing operators who may have greater financial resources, could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete with a number of integrated national and international oil companies who produce crude oil, some of which is used in their refining operations. Unlike these oil companies, we must purchase all of our crude oil from unaffiliated sources. Because these oil companies benefit from increased commodity prices, and have greater access to capital and have stronger capital structures, they are able to better withstand poor and volatile market conditions, such as a lower refining margin environment, shortages of crude oil and other feedstocks or extreme price fluctuations.\nWe also face strong competition in the fuel and convenience store retailing market for the sale of retail gasoline and convenience store merchandise. Our competitors include service stations operated by integrated major oil companies and well-recognized national high volume retailers or regional large chain convenience store operators, often selling gasoline or merchandise at aggressively competitive prices.\nSome of these competitors may have access to greater financial resources, which may provide them with a better ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. Fundamental changes in the supply dynamics of foreign product imports could lead to reduced margins for the refined products we market, which could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our fuel retailing business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market for our common stock has been historically illiquid, which may affect your ability to sell your shares.\nThe volume of trading in our common stock has historically been low. In addition, a substantial amount of our common stock is held by two investors who have restrictions on their ability to sell the stock. The lack of substantial liquidity can adversely affect the price of our stock at a time when you might want to sell your shares. There is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be maintained on the NYSE MKT, or that the volume of trading will be sufficient to allow for timely trades. Investors may not be able to sell their shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or if trading volume is limited. In addition, if trading volume in our common stock is limited, trades of relatively small numbers of shares may have a disproportionate effect on the market price of our common stock.\nConcentrated stock ownership and a restrictive certificate of incorporation provision may discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals.\nZell Credit Opportunities Fund, L.P. (\u201cZCOF\u201d) and Whitebox Advisors, LLC (\u201cWhitebox\u201d), together with their affiliates, each own or have the right to acquire as of March 9, 2015 approximately 32.8% and 24.1%, respectively, or when aggregated, 56.9% of our outstanding common stock. The level of their combined ownership of shares of common stock could have the effect of discouraging or impeding an unsolicited acquisition proposal. In addition, the change in ownership limitations contained in Article 11 of our certificate of incorporation could have the effect of discouraging or impeding an unsolicited takeover proposal.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nWe have in the past and may in the future register shares of common stock for sale or resale under the Securities Act in the future. Additionally, 749,148 shares of our common stock are issuable upon the exercise of common stock warrants at a nominal price. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock, or the availability of our common for future sales, will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales in the public market of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. The potential effect of these shares being sold may be to depress the price at which our common stock trades.\nRisks Related to the Mid Pac Acquisition\nAcquisitions, such as the Mid Pac acquisition, if completed, may prove to be worth less than we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating potential liabilities.\nWe expect acquisitions to be instrumental to our future growth. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of potential unknown and contingent liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In connection with our assessments, we perform due diligence reviews of acquired companies and their businesses that we believe are generally consistent with industry practices. However, such reviews will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our reviews may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with potential environmental problems or other contingent and unknown liabilities that may exist or arise. We conducted limited due diligence in connection with the Mid Pac acquisition prior to signing the merger agreement and are continuing to conduct due diligence during the period between the signing and closing of the acquisition. Certain due diligence related to competitive factors will not be known until the HSR review is completed. As a result, there may be unknown and contingent liabilities related to Mid Pac and its business of which we are unaware. We could be liable for unknown obligations relating to the Mid Pac acquisition, if completed, for which indemnification is not available, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe representations, warranties and indemnification obligations of Koko\u2019oha in the merger agreement are limited; as a result, the assumptions on which our estimates of future results contemplated by the merger agreement have been based may prove to be incorrect in a number of material ways, resulting in our not realizing the expected benefits of the Mid Pac acquisition, if completed.\nThe representations and warranties of Koko\u2019oha contained in the merger agreement are limited. In addition, the agreement provides limited indemnities. As a result, the assumptions on which our estimates of future results of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement have been based may prove to be incorrect in a number of material ways and we may not have an adequate remedy under the merger agreement. Consequently, we may not realize the expected benefits of the Mid Pac acquisition.\nWe may have difficulty integrating and managing the growth associated with the Mid Pac acquisition.\nThe Mid Pac acquisition, if completed, is expected to result in a significant growth in our assets and revenues and may place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational, and administrative resources. We may not be able to integrate the operations of Mid Pac without increases in costs, losses in revenues, or other difficulties. In addition, we may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies, synergies, costs savings, or other benefits expected from the Mid Pac acquisition. Any unexpected costs or delays incurred in connection with such integration could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We believe integration expenses related to Mid Pac will be significant for at least the first half of 2015. Our ability to continue to grow after the Mid Pac acquisition will depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to identify and acquire new acquisition targets, our ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel, the results of our acquisition efforts, and access to capital. We may not be successful in achieving or managing growth and any such failure could have a material adverse effect on us.\nObtaining required regulatory approvals may prevent or delay completion of the Mid Pac acquisition or reduce the anticipated benefits of the Mid Pac acquisition or may require changes to the structure or terms of the Mid Pac acquisition.\nCompletion of the Mid Pac acquisition is conditioned upon, among other things, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period, including any extension thereof, under HSR. The time it takes to obtain these approvals may delay the completion of the Mid Pac acquisition. Further, regulatory authorities may place certain conditions on their approval of the transaction. Satisfying these conditions may also delay the completion of the transaction and/or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the Mid Pac acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, at any time before or after the transaction is completed, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws in opposition to the transaction, including seeking to enjoin completion of the transaction, condition completion of the transaction upon the divestiture of certain assets or impose restrictions on the post-closing operations. Any of these requirements or restrictions may prevent or delay completion of the Mid Pac acquisition or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the Mid Pac acquisition, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79259, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "PARR"}
