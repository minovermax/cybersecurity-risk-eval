{"cik": "1091907", "company": "WORLD WRESTLING ENTERTAINMENTINC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could affect our business. See the discussion under \u201cCautionary Statement for Purposes of the \u2018Safe Harbor\u2019 Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\u201d in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company has spent, and will likely continue to spend, substantial amounts to produce content and infrastructure for distribution of content on our new WWE Network which launched domestically in early 2014 and began to be launched internationally in late 2014. We are still developing expertise in the digital distribution platforms that carry WWE Network on a subscription basis and could experience significant setbacks in such monetization efforts. If, for any of a number of reasons, we are unable to monetize this distribution platform successfully, these additional costs, and the loss of very significant revenue from other distribution platforms being displaced, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nLoss of Pay-Per-View Revenue. As part of the subscription to WWE Network, we are including programming that we historically offered through pay-per-view channels. On a pay-per-view basis, such programming resulted in worldwide revenues of $82.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013; for the year ended December 31, 2014, pay-per-view revenues were $45.2 million. We believe this reduction was directly tied to our launch of WWE Network. Although we continued distributing this programming through certain pay-per-view channels after the launch of WWE Network, some previous distributors no longer carry such programming. If, for any number of reasons, our audience does not subscribe to WWE Network in sufficient numbers to generate adequate subscription revenues to offset or exceed the loss of pay-per-view revenue resulting from WWE Network, the resulting loss of revenue and profit could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nNeed to Attract, Retain and Replace Subscribers. We believe that WWE has a passionate fan base. However, the markets for entertainment video are intensely competitive and include many subscription, transactional and ad-supported models and vast amounts of pirated materials, all of which capture segments of the entertainment video market. This competition has increased significantly in the recent past, and the Company expects this competition to continue to grow. Many players that have entered this space have vastly greater financial and marketing resources than the Company as well as longer operating histories, large customer bases and strong brand recognition. These competitors may secure better terms from suppliers, aggressively price their offerings and devote more technology and marketing resources. Recent offerings include subscription digital services from Amazon, CBS, HBO, Nickelodeon and many others. There are also more experienced competitors for subscribers\u2019 business such as Netflix and Hulu Plus. Other competitors include broadcast, cable and satellite television, many of which have so-called \u201cTV everywhere\u201d and \u201con demand\u201d content, online movie and television content providers (both legal and illegal (pirated)), and DVD rentals and sales. Our ability to attract and retain subscribers to WWE Network will depend in part on our ability to provide a consistent high quality service that is perceived to constitute good value for the consumer\u2019s entertainment dollars. We face competition with respect to service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features, which may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain these subscribers. In addition, subscribers are allowed to cancel their subscriptions at any time after a month and could do so for a number of reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, unsatisfactory content, including as a result of change in consumer tastes or otherwise, competitive entertainment at a lower price and customer service issues. This is commonly referred to as \u201cchurn.\u201d Churn may be more pronounced in the periods following larger WWE events shown on WWE Network such as WrestleMania. We will need to add new subscribers to replace subscribers who cancel in order to grow our business. If we do not attract subscribers, if too many of our subscribers cancel our service, or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in sufficient numbers, our financial outlook, liquidity, business and operating results would be adversely affected.\nSignificant Initial and Ongoing Costs. Our new WWE Network has and will continue to require significant capital expenditures and operating costs. Capital expenditures result in increased amortization and depreciation and may require impairment charges if they do not provide adequate results. Any and all such costs, if not more than offset by revenues from WWE Network, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nEmerging Business. We believe that we entered the market for subscription digital streaming at a relatively early stage. We believe acceptance of this type of service is growing among users, that our fans are technologically sophisticated and that the market is not saturated. We could, however, find that we entered this business too early and that a number of our fans are unwilling to migrate to a digital network. Alternatively, we could find that we entered this business too late and that other players, who have greater experience and resources than we, have occupied the space in a manner that will create significant barriers to our success or there will be dominant competition in the market for this type of service going forward. Under either scenario, our ability to\nattract and retain subscribers will be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nReliance on Partners to Offer the Network. We offer subscribers the ability to receive streaming content through their PCs, Macs and other Internet-connected devices, including game consoles and mobile devices, such as tablets and mobile phones as well as smart televisions and Blu-ray players. We intend to continue to broaden our ability to stream programming to other platforms and partners. We rely on MLB Advanced Media (\"MLBAM\"), an outside contractor, to develop and supply significant portions of the technology and infrastructure to deliver our content and interact with the user. If we are not successful in maintaining our relationship with MLBAM or if we are not successful in entering into and maintaining relationships with platform providers, if the costs of maintaining these relationships increase materially, or if we encounter technological, licensing or other impediments to our streaming content, or if viewers migrate from our platforms to platforms we do not or cannot utilize, our ability to compete successfully could be adversely impacted. Agreements with our providers are typically relatively short term in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us. Certain platforms, such as Amazon and Apple, offer their own content as well as WWE Network and, therefore, may be disincentivized to promote and deliver WWE Network at the same level as provided for its own content.\nPossible Disruption of Systems to be Utilized in Our Operations. Our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our subscribers will be dependent upon the reliable performance of our computer systems and those of third-parties that we utilize in our operations. Interruptions in these systems, or with the Internet in general, due to weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss or other force majeure type events, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver content, and we do not carry business interruption insurance. Delivery of audiovisual material over the Internet is done through a series of carriers with switch-overs between carriers, and any point of failure in this distribution chain would cause a disruption or degradation of our signal. Service disruption or degradation for any of the foregoing reasons could diminish the overall attractiveness of our subscription service to subscribers or cause us to spend money to credit subscribers affected by such disruption.\nOur servers and those of third parties we will use in our operations are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions and could experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse, theft or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable Company or subscriber data or information. Any attempt by hackers to disrupt our service or otherwise access our systems, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy, expose us to litigation and/or damage our reputation. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access.\nEnhancements and modifications to WWE Network technology from time to time become commercially necessary, and these consume considerable resources in capital and operating expenditures. If we are unable to acquire, maintain and enhance the technology to manage the streaming of content to our subscribers in a timely and efficient manner either through an outside contractor, other third parties or ourselves, our ability to retain existing subscribers and to add new subscribers may be impaired. In addition, if our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, our ability to attract and/or retain subscribers or add new subscribers may be impaired. Also, any harm to our subscribers' personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFires, floods, earthquakes, power losses, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events could damage systems and hardware used for our service or cause them to fail completely. As we do not maintain entirely redundant systems, a disrupting event could result in prolonged downtime of our operations for which we likely will not have adequate insurance coverage. Any such disrupting event could adversely affect our business.\nImpact of Government Regulations. The adoption or modification of laws and regulations relating to the Internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we plan to conduct our business. The growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our proposed business model. In addition, the delivery of WWE Network in international markets exposes us to multiple regulatory frameworks, the complexity of which may result in unintentional noncompliance which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including laws and/or court decisions that have the effect of limiting Internet neutrality, could limit the demand for our subscription service and increase our cost of doing business. In late 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d) adopted so-called net neutrality rules intended, in part, to prevent network operators from discriminating against legal traffic that transverse their networks. These rules were overturned by court ruling. The FCC has recently proposed rules to require Internet neutrality, including by\nproposing to regulate consumer Internet service as a public utility. No assurances can be given that these proposed rules will be adopted or, if adopted, what final form the rules will take or that they would withstand litigation if brought. To the extent that network operators engage in discriminatory practices, our business could be adversely impacted. As we expand internationally, government regulation concerning the Internet, and in particular, net neutrality, may be nascent or non-existent. Within such a regulatory environment, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business. Similarly, to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers (such as through tiered access or pricing), due to the heavy bandwidth use of audio/visual content we could incur greater operating expenses and our subscriber acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted.\nMost network operators that provide consumers access to the Internet also provide consumers audiovisual programming. As a result, these companies have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our success. To the extent they provide preferential treatment to their data or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, WWE Network could be negatively impacted. In international markets these same incentives apply, and consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong of a check on these practices as they are in domestic markets.\nPrivacy concerns. We collect and utilize data supplied by our fans including WWE Network subscribers. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Increased regulation of data utilization practices that limit our ability to use collected data could have an adverse effect on our business. If we were to disclose or use data about our subscribers in a manner that is objectionable to them or is contrary to applicable law, our business reputation could be adversely affected. We could also face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. As our business evolves and as we expand internationally, we will become subject to increasingly complex additional restrictions on our treatment of customer information.\nWe are subject to intellectual property risks. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. In connection with WWE Network, if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that potentially affect aspects of streaming services. For example, there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the Internet and we have been named in lawsuits and other claims alleging that we violated patents in connection with various aspects of our business. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit, can result in costly litigation and diversion of personnel. It also may result in our inability to use technology as currently configured for our current business and/or for WWE Network. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims which may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\nWe intend to spend significant amounts on marketing, including promotional offerings, to attract, retain and renew subscribers, but access to suitable marketing channels might not be available. If companies we plan to use to promote WWE Network believe that we could negatively impact their business, decide that they want to enter similar businesses or wish to support our competitors, we may not be given access to such marketing channels. We may decide not to use certain marketing sources or activities if they are perceived to be ineffective. If adequate marketing channels are not available for any of the foregoing reasons, or for any other reasons, our ability to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected.\nWe may be liable for fraudulent payment transactions. Even when the associated financial institution approves the payment of fees for WWE Network subscribers, from time to time, fraudulent payment methods are used to obtain the service. We do not carry insurance for these fraudulent transactions.\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected. We are expanding our operations internationally and scaling our streaming service to enable anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service. As we expand internationally, we will be subject to varying consumer customs and practices, and to differing legal and regulatory environments. If we are not able to manage this growing complexity, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices, business may be adversely affected.\nOur failure to maintain or renew key television agreements and other licenses could adversely affect our ability to distribute our television programming or other of our goods and services, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur television programming is distributed by cable, satellite and broadcast networks. Because a large portion of our revenues are generated, directly and indirectly, from this distribution of our programming, any failure to maintain (such as due to a breach or alleged breach by either party) or renew arrangements with distributors and platforms, the failure of distributors or platforms\nto continue to provide services to us or the failure to enter into new distribution opportunities on terms favorable to us could adversely affect our financial outlook, liquidity, business and operating results. We regularly engage in negotiations relating to substantial agreements covering the distribution of our television programming by carriers located in the United States and abroad. Over the past several years we have expanded our relationship with NBC Universal (\"NBCU\") and they currently distribute the vast majority of our domestic television programming through several of its cable networks. Many of our other goods and services, such as our toys, video games and home video offerings are manufactured and sold by other parties under licenses of our intellectual property or distribution agreements. Our inability for any of the reasons set forth in these Risk Factors to maintain and/or renew these agreements on terms favorable to us could adversely affect our financial outlook, liquidity, business and/or operating results.\nOur failure to continue to build and maintain our brand of entertainment could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe must continue to build and maintain our strong brand identity to attract and retain fans who have a number of entertainment choices. The creation, marketing and distribution of live and televised entertainment, including our WWE Network programming, that our fans value and enjoy is at the core of our business. The production of compelling live and televised content is critical to our ability to generate revenues across our media platforms and product outlets. Also important are effective consumer communications, such as marketing, customer service and public relations. If our efforts to create compelling services and goods and/or otherwise promote and maintain our brand, services and merchandise are not successful, our ability to attract and retain fans may be adversely affected. Such a result would likely lead to a decline in our television ratings, attendance at our live events the number of WWE Network subscribers, or otherwise impact our sales of goods and services, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nOur failure to retain or continue to recruit key performers could lead to a decline in the appeal of our storylines and the popularity of our brand of entertainment, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success depends, in large part, upon our ability to recruit, train and retain athletic performers who have the physical presence, acting ability and charisma to portray characters in our live events and televised programming. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to identify, train and retain these performers. Additionally, throughout our history performers from time to time have stopped working for us for any number of reasons, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our current performers during the terms of their contracts or when their contracts expire. Our failure to attract and retain key performers, an increase in the costs required to attract and retain such performers, or a serious or untimely injury to, or the death of, or unexpected or premature loss or retirement for any reason of, any of our key performers could lead to a decline in the appeal of our storylines and the popularity of our brand of entertainment, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nA decline in the popularity of our brand of sports entertainment, including as a result of changes in the social and political climate, could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are affected by consumer tastes and entertainment trends, which are unpredictable and subject to change and may be affected by changes in the social and political climate. Our programming is created to evoke a passionate response from our fans. Changes in our fans\u2019 tastes or a material change in the perceptions of our business partners, including our distributors and licensees, whether as a result of the social and political climate or otherwise, could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe unexpected loss of the services of Vincent K. McMahon could adversely affect our ability to create popular characters and creative storylines or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition to serving as Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. McMahon leads the creative team that develops the storylines and the characters for our televised programming and live events. Mr. McMahon, from time to time, has also been an important member of our cast of performers. The loss of Mr. McMahon due to unexpected retirement, disability, death or other unexpected termination for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create popular characters and creative storylines or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in the regulatory atmosphere and related private sector initiatives could adversely affect our television business.\nWhile the production of television programming by independent producers is not directly regulated by the federal or state governments in the United States, the marketplace for television programming in the United States is affected significantly by government regulations applicable to, as well as social and political influences on, television stations, television networks and cable and satellite television systems and channels. We voluntarily designate the suitability of each of our television shows using standard industry ratings, and all of our programming currently has a PG rating. Domestic and foreign governmental and private-sector initiatives relating to the content of media programming are announced from time to time. Any failure by us to meet these governmental policies and private-sector expectations could restrict our program content and adversely affect our levels of viewership and operating results.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive, rapidly changing and increasingly fragmented, and we may not be able to compete effectively, especially against competitors with greater financial resources or marketplace presence, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face competition for our audiences from professional and college sports, as well as from other forms of live and televised, streamed and filmed entertainment and other leisure activities in a rapidly changing and increasingly fragmented marketplace. The manner in which audio/video content is distributed and viewed is constantly changing. Changes in technology require Company resources including personnel, capital and operating expenses. For instance, as television delivery moves to 4K technology, the Company could face higher costs of delivering its televised content. While we attempt to distribute our content across all platforms, our failure to continue to do so effectively (including, for example only, our emphasizing a distribution platform that in time lessens in importance or becomes obsolete or our loss of, or other inability to procure, carriage on an important platform) could adversely affect our operating results. If other providers of entertainment video address the changes in consumer viewing habits in a manner that is better able to meet content distributor and consumer needs and expectations, our business could be adversely affected. For the sale of our consumer products, we compete with entertainment companies, professional and college sports leagues and other makers of branded apparel and merchandise. Many of the companies with whom we compete have greater financial resources than we do.\nOur failure to compete effectively could result in a significant loss of viewers, subscribers, venues, distribution channels or performers and fewer entertainment and advertising dollars spent on our form of sports entertainment, any of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face uncertainties associated with international markets, which could adversely affect our operating results and impair our business strategy.\nWe are consistently negotiating and entering into new licenses and renewals and extensions of existing agreements for our products and services including television programming, in international markets. In late 2014, we began the rollout of WWE Network in international markets. Cultural norms and regulatory frameworks vary in the markets in which we operate and our products' nonconformance to local norms or applicable law, regulations or licensing requirements could affect our sales, viewership and success in the markets. Our production of live events overseas subjects us to the risks involved in foreign travel and local regulations, including regulations requiring us to obtain visas for our performers. In addition, these live events and the licensing of our television and consumer products in international markets expose us to some degree of currency risk. International operations may be subject to political instability inherent in varying degrees in those markets. Other risks relating to foreign operations include difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, management distraction, compliance with U.S. and international laws relating to bribery, less favorable foreign intellectual property laws, foreign currency risks and laws relating to repatriation of funds, lower levels of Internet availability and complexity of VAT and other local tax laws as well as data protection and other regulatory matters. These risks could adversely affect our operating results and impair our ability to pursue our business strategy as it relates to international markets.\nWe may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events if we do not comply with applicable regulations, which could lead to a decline in the various revenue streams generated from our live events, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, athletic commissions and other applicable regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and/or other permits or licenses for performers and/or permits for events in order for us to promote and conduct our live events. In the event that we fail to comply with the regulations of a particular jurisdiction, we may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events in that jurisdiction. The inability to present our live events over an extended period of time or in a number of jurisdictions could lead to a decline in the various revenue streams generated from our live events, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nBecause we depend upon our intellectual property rights, our inability to protect those rights, or our infringement of others\u2019 intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our business.\nIntellectual property is material to all aspects of our business. Our inability to protect our large portfolio of trademarks, service marks, copyrighted material and characters, trade names and other intellectual property rights from piracy, counterfeiting or other unauthorized use could negatively affect our business materially. We expend substantial cost and effort in an attempt to maintain and protect our intellectual property and to maintain compliance vis-\u00e0-vis other parties\u2019 intellectual property. We have a large portfolio of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks worldwide and maintain a large catalog of copyrighted works, including copyrights to our television programming, music, photographs, books, magazines and apparel art. A principal focus of our efforts is to protect the intellectual property relating to our originally created characters portrayed by our performers, which encompasses images, likenesses, names and other identifying indicia of these characters. We also own a large number of Internet website domain names and operate a network of developed, content-based sites, which facilitate and contribute to the\nexploitation of our intellectual property worldwide. Our failure to curtail piracy, infringement or other unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights effectively, or our infringement of others\u2019 intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our relationships with the companies that distribute our goods and services and/or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWhile we generally own the intellectual property in our content, we generally do not own any intellectual property relating to the distribution of this content. From time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the Internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current or future technologies and could significantly impact our ability to market our services or merchandise our products. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\nOur distribution mechanisms for our goods and services are increasingly complex across various distribution platforms, various geographical areas and timing windows.\nOur inadvertent grant of inconsistent rights or allegations of such inconsistent grants could result in claims of breach of our distribution agreements or licenses and/or litigation which could adversely impact our operations.\nWe could incur substantial liability in the event of accidents or injuries occurring during our physically demanding events.\nWe hold numerous live events each year. This schedule exposes our performers and our employees who are involved in the production of those events to the risk of travel and performance-related accidents, the consequences of which are not fully covered by insurance. The physical nature of our events exposes our performers to the risk of serious injury or death. Although our performers, as independent contractors, are responsible for maintaining their own health, disability and life insurance, we self-insure medical costs for our performers for injuries that they incur while performing. We also self-insure a substantial portion of any other liability that we could incur relating to such injuries. Liability to us resulting from any death or serious injury sustained by one of our performers while performing, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. As noted below, we have recently been named as a defendant in litigation claiming that professional wrestling as currently and historically performed by us has resulted in significant injuries to our performers including, but not limited to, chronic traumatic encephalopathy of \"CTE\".\nOur live events entail other risks inherent in public live events, which could lead to disruptions to our business as well as liability to other parties, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe hold numerous live events each year, both domestically and internationally. Certain risks are inherent in large events of this type as well as the travel to and from them. Although we believe we take appropriate safety and financial precautions in connection with our events, possible difficulties could occur including air and land travel interruption or accidents, the spread of illness, injuries resulting from building problems, pyrotechnics or other equipment malfunction, terrorism or other violence, local labor strikes and other \"force majeure\" type events. These issues could result in canceled events and other disruptions to our business for which we do not carry business interruption insurance, or could result in liability to other parties. Any of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nWe continue to face certain risks relating to our feature film business, which could result in higher production costs and asset impairment charges, which could adversely affect our financial condition or our results of operations.\nWe have substantial capitalized film costs. The accounting for our film business in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles entails significant judgment used to develop estimates of expected future revenues from films. If expected revenue from one or more of our films does not materialize because audience demand does not meet expectations, our estimated revenues may not be sufficient to recoup our investment in the film. If actual revenues are lower than our estimated revenues or if costs are higher than expected, we may be required to record an impairment charge and write down the capitalized costs of the film. No assurance can be given that we will not record additional impairment charges in future periods. In addition capitalized film costs are reflected net of certain production tax incentives granted by various governmental authorities. Our ability to realize these credits may be limited by changes in the legislation governing the incentives and/or the economic environment. The inability to realize these credits would have the effect of increasing our overall production costs.\nIn addition to the risks noted above relating to WWE Network, we could face a variety of risks if we expand into other new and complementary businesses and/or make certain investments.\nWe have entered into new or complementary businesses and made investments in other companies in the past and plan to continue to do so in the future. Risks of expansion may include, among other risks: potential diversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources, including available cash, from our existing businesses; unanticipated liabilities or contingencies; reduced earnings due to increased amortization, impairment charges and other costs; competition from other companies with more experience in such businesses; and possible additional regulatory requirements and compliance costs which could affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe face various risks relating to our computer systems and online operations, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition or our results of operations.\nThe Company faces the risk of a security breach or disruption, whether through external cyber intrusion or from persons with access to systems inside our organization. Although the Company makes significant efforts to maintain the security of its computer systems, and has implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that these security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging or that the Company would be promptly aware of them. The Company and certain of its third party service providers receive personal information through web services including WWE Network. In many instances this information is subject to the Company's privacy policies. Personal information received by our service providers includes credit card information in certain instances, most notably WWE Network and WWEShop, the Company's internet retail operations. The Company expends significant effort to ensure compliance with its privacy policy and to ensure that our service providers safeguard credit card information including contractually requiring those providers to remain compliant with applicable PCI Data Security Standards. However, a significant security breach or other disruption involving the Company's or its one or more of its service providers\u2019 computer systems could disrupt the proper functioning of these systems and therefore the Company's operations (for which we likely will not carry sufficient insurance); result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information; require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that could result; and subject the Company to litigation or damage to its reputation. Any or all of these could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nA decline in general economic conditions or disruption of financial markets may, among other things, reduce the discretionary income of consumers or erode advertising markets, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are affected by general economic conditions, which affect consumers\u2019 disposable income. The demand for entertainment and leisure activities tends to be highly sensitive to the level of consumers\u2019 disposable income. Declines in general economic conditions could reduce the level of discretionary income that our fans and potential fans have to spend on our live and televised entertainment, including WWE Network, and consumer products, which could adversely affect our revenues. Volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our clients\u2019, licensees\u2019 and distributors\u2019 ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our television partners derive revenues from the sale of advertising. We also sell advertising directly on our website, on WWE Network and, depending upon the distribution methods used to monetize additional content, we may have additional advertising to sell. Softness in the advertising markets, due to a weak economic environment or otherwise, could adversely affect our revenues or the financial viability of our distributors.\nOur accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our current assets and relate principally to a limited number of distributors and licensees, increasing our exposure to bad debts and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our accounts receivable are from distributors of our Network, pay-per-view, television and home video programming and licensees who produce consumer products containing our intellectual property. The concentration of our accounts receivable across a limited number of distributors subjects us to individual credit risk with respect to such parties. These parties may become insolvent or declare bankruptcy, rendering collection impossible. Certain of the parties are located overseas which can make collections more difficult or economically unfeasible. Additionally, adverse changes in general economic conditions and/or contraction in global credit markets could precipitate liquidity problems among our debtors, including our key distributors and/or licensees. This could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to access our revolving credit facility may be limited due to certain financial covenants and restrictions.\nWe have never borrowed under our revolving credit facility. We currently have access to funds under the facility, if needed, however during 2015 this access may be unavailable due to certain financial covenants unless an amendment is agreed upon. As a result, this credit facility may need to be amended or may be terminated by the Company, in which case we may or may not seek\nto replace it. No assurance can be given that an amendment or suitable replacement will be available or economically viable. Whether or not the facility is available, and whether or not, if unavailable, it is replaced, we believe we have sufficient liquidity for our operating needs and payment of our dividend for 2015. If we are incorrect in this assessment of our liquidity and are unable to obtain adequate capital, our business, financial condition, liquidity and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe could incur substantial liabilities if litigation is resolved unfavorably.\nThe Company has been named as a defendant in two recent lawsuits seeking class action status alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities laws based on certain statements relating to the negotiation of WWE\u2019s domestic television license. The Company strongly disputes the merit of these lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend itself against them. The adverse outcome and/or settlement of either of these lawsuits could result in significant expense to the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and/or our operating results.\nThe Company has also been named as a defendant in two recent lawsuits seeking class action status alleging, among other things, that performers have received traumatic brain injuries and may have CTE. The Company strongly disputes the merit of this type of case and intends to move to dismiss both lawsuits and, if not dismissed, will oppose class certification . This type of litigation is expected to be costly, and by its nature the outcome of litigation is difficult to assess and quantify. In this regard, due to the long time periods claimed to be involved in these cases, the Company\u2019s insurance coverage for them is unclear, and no insurer is currently providing the Company defense costs. The adverse outcome and/or settlement of this litigation could result in significant expense to the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and/or our operating results.\nIn the ordinary course of business we become subject to various other complaints and litigation matters. The outcome of such litigation is inherently difficult to assess and quantify, and the defense against such claims or actions can be costly and time consuming for management. Any adverse judgment in such other litigation significantly in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including as a result of the failure of WWE Network to achieve expectations or as a result of any of the other events, conditions and/or circumstances set forth in these Risk Factors could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nThrough his beneficial ownership of a majority of our Class B common stock, Mr. McMahon can exercise control over our affairs, and his interests may conflict with the holders of our Class A common stock.\nWe have Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The holders of Class A common stock generally have rights identical to holders of Class B common stock, except that holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share, and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. Holders of both classes of common stock generally will vote together as a single class on all matters presented to stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable Delaware law.\nA substantial majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock is owned beneficially by Vincent K. McMahon. Mr. McMahon controls a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. Through his beneficial ownership of a substantial majority of our Class B common stock, Mr. McMahon effectively can exercise control over our affairs, and his interest could conflict with the holders of our Class A common stock. The voting power of Mr. McMahon through his ownership of our Class B common stock could discourage or preclude others from initiating potential mergers, takeovers or other change of control transactions. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe Company\u2019s dividend distributions have in recent years represented a return of capital for tax purposes, and shareholders as a result will recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s aggregate dividend distributions paid in 2014 and 2013 were in excess of its current and accumulated earnings and profits calculated under applicable Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) provisions. Under the IRC, distributions in excess of both the Company\u2019s current earnings and profits and the Company\u2019s accumulated earnings and profits constitute a return of capital and reduce the stockholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its Common Stock. If a stockholder\u2019s adjusted basis in its Common Stock is reduced to zero, these excess distributions thereafter constitute a capital gain to the stockholder.\nOur dividend is significant and is affected by a number of factors.\nOur Board of Directors regularly evaluates the Company\u2019s Common Stock dividend policy and determines the dividend rate each quarter. The level of dividends, if any, will continue to be influenced by many factors, including, among other things, our liquidity and historical and projected cash flow, our strategic plan (including alternative uses of capital), our financial results and condition, contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends (including under our revolving credit facility), general economic and competitive conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors may consider relevant from time to time. All of these factors are subject to the various contingences listed in the other risk factors included in this Form 10-K. We cannot assure our stockholders that dividends will be paid in the future, or that, if paid, dividends will be at the same amount or with the same frequency as in the past. Any reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nA substantial number of shares are eligible for sale by Mr. McMahon and members of his family or trusts established for their benefit, and the sale of those shares could lower our stock price.\nAll of the issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock are held by Vincent McMahon and other members of the McMahon family and trusts set up for these family members. Sales of substantial amounts of these shares, or the perception that such sales could occur, may lower the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock. If any sales or transfers of Class B common stock were to occur to persons outside of the McMahon family, the shares would automatically convert into Class A common stock.\nOur Class A common stock is volatile and has a relatively small public \"float.\"\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly, especially in the past year. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our direct control, including our number of WWE network subscribers, operating results (especially where different from the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community), market volatility in general and short interest in our stock. Given the dynamic nature of our business and all other factors that indirectly limit the predictability of the future, any of our forecasts may differ materially from actual results which could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nHistorically, as a result of our relatively small public float, our Class A common stock has been less liquid than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership, and the trading prices for our Class A common stock have been more volatile than generally may be the case for more widely-held common stock. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our Class A common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our Class A common stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.", "PERMNO": 87356, "SIC": 7812, "TIC": "WWE"}
