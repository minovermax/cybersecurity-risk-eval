Risk Factors\nThe following summarizes the principal factors that make an investment in our company speculative or risky, all of which are more fully described in the Risk Factors section below. This summary should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations:\n\u2022The success of our business largely depends on activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry, which can be affected by the amount and volatility of oil and natural gas prices.\n\u2022The markets in which we operate are highly competitive.\n\u2022We may hold excess or obsolete inventory.\n\u2022We may not realize revenue on our current backlog due to customer order reductions, cancellations or acceptance delays, which may negatively impact our financial results.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\u2022The industry in which we operate is undergoing continuing consolidation that may impact our results of operations.\n\u2022A greater focus on budgetary discipline and technological advances have caused a decline in customer spending that may remain at a low level despite an increase in commodity prices.\n\u2022Our Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers are critical to our business and these individuals may not remain with us in the future.\n\u2022We may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers.\n\u2022We rely on relationships with key suppliers to operate and maintain our business.\n\u2022Our business depends upon our ability to obtain key raw materials and specialized equipment from suppliers.\n\u2022We may not be able to satisfy technical requirements, testing requirements, code requirements or other specifications under contracts and contract tenders.\n\u2022A failure or breach of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and results of operations and expose us to potential liabilities.\n\u2022Our success depends on our ability to implement new technologies and services more efficiently and quickly than our competitors.\n\u2022Our success will be affected by the use and protection of our proprietary technology.\n\u2022We may incur liabilities, fines, penalties or additional costs, or we may be unable to sell to certain customers if we do not maintain safe operations.\n\u2022Facility consolidations or expansions may subject us to risks of operating inefficiencies, construction delays and cost overruns.\n\u2022Our acquisitions and dispositions may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated.\n\u2022A natural disaster, catastrophe or other event could result in severe property damage, which could curtail our operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks:\n\u2022Governmental laws and regulations may affect our and our customers\u2019 costs, prohibit or curtail our customers\u2019 operations in certain areas, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.\n\u2022Potential legislation or regulations restricting the use of hydraulic fracturing could reduce demand for our products.\n\u2022Our financial results could be adversely impacted by changes in regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and development activity in response to significant environmental incidents.\n\u2022Our operations are subject to environmental and operational safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\n\u2022Our business operations worldwide are subject to anti-corruption and trade sanction laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.\n\u2022We are subject to litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance.\n\u2022The number and cost of our current and future asbestos claims could be substantially higher than we have estimated and the timing of payment of claims could be sooner than we have estimated.\n\u2022Our products are used in operations that are subject to potential hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry and, as a result, we are exposed to potential liabilities that could affect our financial condition and reputation.\n\u2022Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs or reduce demand for our products.\nRisks Related to our International Operations\n\u2022We may be adversely affected by developments and economic uncertainty relating to the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union.\n\u2022Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations may result in fluctuations in our cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock, Indebtedness and Financial Condition:\n\u2022Our common stock price has been volatile, and we expect it to continue to remain volatile in the future.\n\u2022We have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our leverage and debt service obligations restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\n\u2022The indenture governing our 2025 Notes and our Credit Facility contain operating and financial restrictions that restrict our business and financing activities.\n\u2022Our ability to access the capital and credit markets to raise capital on favorable terms is limited by our debt level, industry conditions and credit rating.\n\u2022We have incurred impairment charges in the past and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future.\n\u2022L.E. Simmons & Associates (\u201cLESA\u201d), through SCF, may significantly influence the outcome of stockholder voting and may exercise this voting power in a manner adverse to our other stockholders.\n\u2022Certain of our directors may have conflicts of interest because they are also directors or officers of SCF. The resolution of these conflicts of interest may not be in the best interests of our Company or our other stockholders.\n\u2022We have renounced any interest in specified business opportunities, and SCF and its director nominees on our board of directors generally have no obligation to offer us those opportunities.\nRisks related to our business and operations:\nThe success of our business largely depends on activity levels in the oil and natural gas industry, which can be affected by the amount and volatility of oil and natural gas prices.\nWe have experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles. The willingness of oil and natural gas operators to make capital expenditures to explore for and produce oil and natural gas, the need of oilfield services companies to replenish consumable parts and the willingness of these customers to invest in capital equipment depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control. Such factors include:\n\u2022supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other major producers to set and maintain production limits;\n\u2022cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022levels of drilling and completions activity;\n\u2022expected decline in rates of current and future production, or faster than anticipated declines in production;\n\u2022discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures implemented by governments worldwide;\n\u2022ability of our customers to access new markets or areas of production or to continue to access current markets, including as a result of trade restrictions;\n\u2022weather conditions, including hurricanes, that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area;\n\u2022natural disasters, catastrophes or other events resulting in severe property damage;\n\u2022more stringent environmental regulations;\n\u2022prohibitions, moratoriums or similar limitations on drilling or hydraulic fracturing activity resulting in a cessation or disruption of operations;\n\u2022domestic and worldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022financial stability of our customers and other industry participants;\n\u2022political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022shareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022conservation measures and technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022price and availability of alternative energy resources and fuels;\n\u2022uncertainty in capital and commodities markets, and the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise equity capital and debt financing;\n\u2022interest rates and the cost of capital; and\n\u2022merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers, drilling contractors and oilfield service companies.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has historically experienced periodic reductions in the overall level of exploration and development activities in connection with declines in commodity prices. As a result, there are periodic reductions in the demand for our products and services, downward pressure on the prices that we charge and ultimately an adverse impact on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted demand for oil and natural gas, which has contributed to further price volatility. It is uncertain whether commodity prices will maintain current levels, decline or increase in 2021. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the near term. Declines in oil and natural gas prices, decreased levels of exploration, development, and production activity, and the willingness of customers to invest in their equipment relative to historical norms may negatively affect:\n\u2022revenues, cash flows, and profitability;\n\u2022the ability to maintain or increase borrowing capacity;\n\u2022the ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital;\n\u2022the ability to collect outstanding amounts from our customers; and\n\u2022the ability to attract and retain skilled personnel to maintain our business or that will be needed in the event of an upturn in the demand for our products.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, including some competitors that hold substantial market share and have substantially greater resources than we do, as well as a number of regional or local competitors for certain of our product lines. We may not be able to compete successfully in this environment.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and our products and services are subject to competition from significantly larger businesses. We have several competitors that are large national and multinational companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, we compete with many small companies on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements. In addition, several of our competitors provide a much broader array of services, and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets and, as such, may be better positioned to withstand an extended downturn. Our larger competitors are able to use their size and purchasing power to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions. Furthermore, some of our customers are our competitors and have in the past ceased buying from us, and may do the same in the future. We also have competitors outside of the U.S. with lower structural costs due to labor and raw material cost in and around their manufacturing centers, and prices based on foreign currencies. Accordingly, currency fluctuations may cause U.S. dollar-priced products to be less competitive than our competitors\u2019 products that are priced in other currencies. Moreover, our competitors may utilize available capacity during a period of depressed energy prices to gain market share.\nNew competitors have also entered the markets in which we compete. We consider product quality, price, breadth of product offering, availability of products and services, performance, distribution capabilities, technical expertise, responsiveness to customer needs, reputation for service and intellectual property rights to be the primary competitive factors. Competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing, duplicate strategies, or develop enhancements to products that offer performance features that are superior to our products. In addition, we may not be able to retain key employees of entities that we acquire in the future and those employees may choose to compete against us following a contractually agreed period of non-competition that is permitted under the law. Competitive pressures, including those described above, and other factors could adversely affect our competitive position, resulting in a loss of market share or decreases in prices. For more information about our competitors, please read \u201cBusiness-Competition.\u201d\nGiven the uncertainty related to long-term commodity prices and associated customer demand, we hold excess or obsolete inventory and have experienced a reduction in gross margins and financial results.\nWe cannot accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future. Orders are placed with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and, in some instances, we may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. At certain times, we have built capital equipment before receiving customer orders, and we have kept our standardized downhole protection systems and certain of our flow iron products in stock and readily available for delivery on short notice from customers. Our forecasts of customer demand are based on multiple assumptions, which have introduced errors into the estimates. These forecasts were particularly challenging recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of uncertain demand levels and inability by our customers to receive finished goods. In addition, many of our suppliers, such as those for certain of our standardized valves, require a longer lead time to provide products than our customers demand for delivery of our finished products. If we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we would allocate resources to the purchase of material or manufactured products that we are not be able to sell when we expect to, if at all. As a result, we would hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce gross margin and adversely affect financial results upon writing down the value of inventory. In addition, any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect profit margins, increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.\nWe may not realize revenue on our current backlog due to customer order reductions, cancellations or acceptance delays, which may negatively impact our financial results.\nUncertainty regarding demand for our customers\u2019 services has resulted in order reductions, cancellations and acceptance delays, and we may experience more of these in the future. We may be unable to collect revenue for all of the orders reflected in our backlog, or we may be unable to collect cancellation penalties, to the extent we have the right to impose them, or the revenues may be pushed into future periods. In addition, customers who are more highly leveraged or otherwise unable to pay their creditors in the ordinary course of business may become insolvent or be unable to operate as a going concern. We may be unable to collect amounts due or damages we are awarded from these customers, and our efforts to collect such amounts may damage our customer relationships. Our results of operations and overall financial condition may be negatively impacted by a reduction in revenue as a result of these circumstances.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related responses by governmental authorities and changes to consumer behavior have significantly impacted global economic activity. In addition to impacts on oil and natural gas markets (as described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Market Conditions\u201d), the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in further declines in the global rig count and North America completions activities that have and may continue to impact our business and operations. These events have directly affected our business and have compounded the impact from many of the risks described in this Risk Factors section, including those relating to our customers\u2019 capital spending and trends in oil and natural gas prices. Demand for our products and services has declined and is expected to remain depressed as our customers have reduced their capital budgets in response to lower commodity prices. In addition, we are facing, and expect to continue to face, logistical challenges including border closures, travel restrictions and an inability to commute to certain facilities and job sites, as we provide services and products to our customers. We are also experiencing inefficiencies surrounding stay-at-home orders and remote work arrangements.\nGiven the nature and significance of the events described above, we are not able to enumerate all potential risks to our business; however, we believe that in addition to the impacts described above, other current or potential impacts of these recent events include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022supply chain disruptions for essential raw materials, including product import and export restrictions;\n\u2022claims that non-performance is permitted due to force majeure or other reasons;\n\u2022customers may delay or default on payment obligations, and/or seek bankruptcy protection that could delay or prevent collections of certain accounts receivable;\n\u2022liquidity challenges\n\u2022a credit rating downgrade and higher borrowing costs in the future;\n\u2022cybersecurity issues, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of and increased sophistication in cyberattacks in the current environment of remote connectivity, which could disrupt our operations or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or company information and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to COVID-19 and its impact, including with respect to commercial contracts, employee matters and insurance arrangements;\n\u2022reduction of our global workforce to adjust to market conditions, including severance payments, retention issues, and an inability to hire employees when market conditions improve;\n\u2022costs associated with rationalization of our portfolio of real estate facilities, including possible exit of leases and facility closures to align with expected activity and workforce capacity;\n\u2022additional asset impairments, including an impairment of the carrying value of our intangible assets, property and equipment, along with other accounting charges related to reduced demand for our products and services;\n\u2022infections and quarantining of our employees and the personnel of our customers, suppliers and other third parties in areas in which we operate;\n\u2022changes in the regulation of the production of hydrocarbons, such as the imposition of limitations on the production of oil and natural gas by states or other jurisdictions, that may result in additional limits on demand for our products and services;\n\u2022actions undertaken by national, regional and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or treat its effects; and\n\u2022a structural shift in the global economy and its demand for oil and natural gas as a result of changes in the way people work, travel and interact, or in connection with a global recession or depression.\nGiven the dynamic nature of these events, we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that the COVID-19 pandemic and related market conditions will persist, the full extent of the impact they will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or the pace or extent of any subsequent recovery. The ultimate extent of the impact of the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, the success of vaccination programs and the related impact on overall economic activity, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. We expect our activity levels will continue to be substantially below previous year levels, coupled with downward pressure on the price of our products and services, and corresponding reductions in revenue and operating margins.\nThe confluence of events described above have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our business, and depending on the duration of the pandemic and its effect on the oil and natural gas industry, could have, a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. For more information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Market Conditions.\u201d\nThe industry in which we operate is undergoing continuing consolidation that may impact our results of operations.\nSome of our largest customers have consolidated and are using their size and purchasing power to achieve economies of scale and pricing concessions. This consolidation could result in reduced capital spending by such customers or decreased demand for our products and services. If we cannot maintain sales levels for customers that have consolidated or replace such revenues with increased business activities from other customers, this consolidation activity could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition. We are unable to predict what effect consolidations in the industry may have on prices, capital spending by customers, selling strategies, competitive position, customer retention or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with customers.\nA greater focus on budgetary discipline and technological advances have caused a decline in customer spending that may remain at a low level despite an increase in commodity prices.\nA portion of our business is driven by our customers\u2019 spending on capital equipment such as drilling rigs. Our customers and their investors have adopted business strategies placing significant emphasis on capital discipline that has limited the level of their spending. In addition, new techniques and technological advances have reduced the number of days required to drill wells. The number of days required for a drilling rig to be on a site to drill a well has in many areas been reduced by at least half over the last several years. This has exacerbated the oversupply of drilling rigs. Given these factors we cannot provide any assurance that our capital equipment sales will increase if there is an increase in commodity prices.\nOur common stock price has been volatile, and we expect it to continue to remain volatile in the future.\nThe market price of common stock of companies engaged in the oil and natural gas equipment manufacturing and services industry has been volatile. Likewise, the market price of our common stock has varied significantly in the past. For example, in 2020, the market price of our common stock reached a high of $40.20 per share on January 7, 2020 and a low of $3.00 per share on March 23, 2020 and April 1, 2020. Additionally, the Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of shares in our public float, which may limit trading and liquidity and increase volatility until more shares become available, if ever. We expect our stock price to continue to remain volatile given the cyclical nature of our industry and our limited public float.\nWe may be adversely affected by developments and economic uncertainty relating to the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union.\nThe U.K. held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority voted for the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d and the U.K. withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020. On December 31, 2020, the transition period during which the trading relationship between the EU and the U.K. remained substantially the same as prior to the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU ended. To ensure as smooth a transition as practicably possible, in December 2020, the U.K. and the EU reached an accord on a trade and cooperation agreement (\u201cTCA\u201d), which is provisionally applicable from January 1, 2021. The TCA was ratified by the U.K. Parliament on December 30, 2020 and awaits formal approval of the European Parliament and adoption by the European Council, both of which are expected to be completed by the end of February 2021. Brexit and the terms of the TCA bring an end to the U.K.\u2019s automatic access to the EU single market, with U.K. goods no longer benefiting from the free movement of goods and the free market of people between the EU and the U.K. also being curtailed.\nThe withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU may adversely affect business activity and economic and market conditions in the U.K., the Eurozone, and globally and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the pound sterling and the euro. In addition, Brexit could lead to additional political, legal, regulatory and economic instability in the EU and the U.K. Depending on the application of the terms of the TCA, our business could face new regulatory costs and challenges, and any adjustments we are required to undertake as a result of Brexit could lead to a significant time and cost commitment from our business. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace and which to maintain. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect the value of our assets in the U.K., as well as our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our leverage and debt service obligations restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness, including $316.9 million of 9.00% convertible secured notes due August 2025 (\u201c2025 Notes\u201d). Our level of indebtedness and restrictions in our debt agreements have significant consequences for our future prospects, including limiting our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing. In addition, we may have difficulty making debt service payments on our indebtedness as such payments become due. Furthermore, our $250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (\u201cCredit Facility\u201d), which had an outstanding balance of $13.1 million as of December 31, 2020, will mature prior to the maturity date of our 2025 Notes. Our level of indebtedness and the terms of our debt agreements affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing existing debt obligations;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u2022reducing our flexibility to plan for, and react to, changes in the economy and in our industry; and\n\u2022impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes.\nOur ability to pay our expenses, and fund our working capital needs and debt obligations, will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors that are outside of our control. As a result of these factors, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to meet our debt obligations. In addition, under the terms of our Credit Facility, any failure to comply with the financial or other covenants of our indebtedness would result in an event of default, which would cause some or all of our indebtedness to become immediately due and payable and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe indenture governing our 2025 Notes and our Credit Facility contain operating and financial restrictions that restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur indenture and Credit Facility contain, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022pay dividends on, purchase or redeem our common stock;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain types of equity securities;\n\u2022create certain liens;\n\u2022sell assets, including equity interests in our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022redeem or prepay subordinated debt or debt that is unsecured or secured on a basis junior to our notes;\n\u2022restrict dividends or other payments of our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create unrestricted subsidiaries; or\n\u2022execute our acquisition strategy.\nOur Credit Facility also contains covenants, which, among other things, require us in certain circumstances, on a consolidated basis, to maintain specified financial ratios or conditions. As a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Our ability to borrow under the Credit Facility and comply with some of the covenants, ratios or tests contained in our indenture and Credit Facility may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, and there is a decrease in our accounts receivable and inventory, our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility will be reduced and our ability to comply with these covenants, ratios or tests may be impaired. A failure to comply with the covenants, ratios or tests would result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, would cause some or all of our indebtedness to become immediately due and payable and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTariffs imposed by the United States government could continue to adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe U.S. government has imposed global tariffs on certain imported steel and aluminum products pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as well as tariffs on Chinese imports pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. In response, China and other countries have imposed retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of U.S. products, including those containing steel and aluminum. Our efforts to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on raw materials through the diversification of our supply chain and exemption requests may not be sufficiently successful. Furthermore, a prolonged imposition of tariffs on our goods could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations may result in fluctuations in our cash flows and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could be material to us depending upon, among other things, our manufacturing locations and the sourcing for our raw materials and components. In particular, we are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and each of the Canadian dollar, the British pound sterling, the Euro, and, to a lesser degree, the Mexican peso, the Chinese yuan, the Singapore dollar, and the Saudi riyal. There may be instances in which costs and revenue will not be matched with respect to currency denomination. As a result, to the extent that we continue our expansion on a global basis, management expects that increasing portions of revenue, costs, assets and liabilities will be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency valuations. We may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Further, the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local currency, resulting in our inability to hedge against these risks.\nOur ability to access the capital and credit markets to raise capital on favorable terms is limited by our debt level, industry conditions and credit rating.\nOur ability to access the capital and credit markets is limited by, among other things, oil and natural gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, the state of the economy, the health of the drilling and overall oil and natural gas industry, trends among investors to avoid companies associated with the production of hydrocarbon products, and the liquidity of the capital markets. Many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets are outside of our control and may be negatively impacted by market events. Recent trends and conditions in the capital and credit markets with respect to the energy sector limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost of capital. Low levels of exploration and drilling activity have caused and may\ncontinue to cause lenders to increase the interest rates under our credit facilities, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms or at all and may reduce or cease to provide funding. If we are unable to access the capital or credit markets on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, particularly in respect of our ability to repay or refinance our debt.\nWe have incurred impairment charges and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized goodwill impairments totaling $471.0 million which is included in \u201cImpairments of goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment\u201d in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Following these impairment charges, there is no remaining goodwill balance for any of our reporting units.\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives, for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. In performing our review for impairment, future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual value upon disposal are estimated. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. The amount of the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined either through the use of an external valuation, or by means of an analysis of discounted future cash flows based on expected utilization.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized property and equipment impairment charges totaling $15.1 million and $7.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized intangible asset impairment charges totaling $5.3 million and $53.5 million, respectively. These charges are included in \u201cImpairments of goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment\u201d in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. See Note 8 Impairments of Goodwill and Long Lived Assets for further information related to these charges.\nIf we determine that the carrying value of our long-lived assets is less than their fair value, we would be required to record additional charges in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers are critical to our business and these individuals may not remain with us in the future.\nOur future success depends in substantial part on our ability to hire and retain executive officers with expertise and strategic vision. In addition, we presently depend upon the significant years of experience, abilities and services of our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, C. Christopher Gaut. The diminution or loss of Mr. Gaut\u2019s services or the services of our other executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, the knowledge and skills possessed by our Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers are transferable to positions outside of the oil and gas industry. As a result, the prolonged industry downturn makes us particularly susceptible to the loss of services of members of our executive team.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers.\nThe delivery of our products and services requires personnel with specialized skills and experience. Our ability to be productive and profitable depends upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. During periods of low activity in our industry, we have reduced the size of our labor force to match declining revenue levels, and other employees have chosen to leave in order to find more stable employment. This causes us to lose skilled personnel, the absence of which could cause us to incur quality, efficiency and deliverability issues in our operations, or delay our response to an upturn in the market. During periods of increasing activity in our industry, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. In addition, during those periods, the demand for skilled workers is high, the supply is limited and the cost to attract and retain qualified personnel increases, especially for skilled workers. For example, we have in the past experienced shortages of engineers, mechanical assemblers, machinists and welders, which in some instances slowed the productivity of certain of our operations. Furthermore, a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. If any of these events were to occur, our ability to respond quickly to customer demands may be inhibited and our growth potential could be impaired.\nWe rely on relationships with key suppliers to operate and maintain our business.\nCertain of our product lines depend on a limited number of third party suppliers. In some cases, the suppliers own the intellectual property rights to the products we sell, or possess the technology or specialized tooling required to\nmanufacture them. As a result of this concentration in part of our supply chain, our business and operations may be negatively affected if our key suppliers were to experience significant disruptions affecting the price, quality, availability or timely delivery of their products, such as from the COVID-19 pandemic, or if they were to decide to terminate their relationships with us. For example, we have a limited number of suppliers for our bearings product lines and certain of our valve product lines. The limited number of these suppliers can restrict the quantity and timeliness of customer deliveries. Recently, some of our suppliers have imposed more stringent payment terms and conditions on us based on our perceived risk as a counterparty. The partial or complete loss of any one of our key suppliers, or a significant adverse change in the relationship with any of these suppliers, through consolidation or otherwise, would limit our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products.\nOur business depends upon our ability to obtain key raw materials and specialized equipment from suppliers. Increased costs of raw materials and other components may result in increased operating expenses.\nShould our suppliers be unable to provide the necessary raw materials or finished products or otherwise fail to deliver such materials and products timely and in the quantities required, resulting delays in the provision of products or services to customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, because many of our products are manufactured out of steel, we are particularly susceptible to fluctuations in steel prices and tariffs. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by our inability to manage the rising costs and availability of raw materials and components used in our products.\nSome of our customer contracts require us to compensate customers if we do not meet specified delivery obligations. We rely on suppliers to provide required materials and in many instances these materials must meet certain specifications. Managing a geographically diverse supply base poses inherently significant logistical challenges. Furthermore, the ability of third party suppliers to deliver materials to our specifications may be affected by events beyond our control. As a result, there is a risk that we could experience diminished supplier performance resulting in longer than expected lead times and/or product quality issues. For example, in the past, we have experienced issues with the quality of certain forgings used to produce materials utilized in our products. As a result, we were required to seek alternative suppliers for those forgings, which resulted in increased costs and a disruption in our supply chain. We have also been required in certain circumstances to provide better economic terms to some of our suppliers in exchange for their agreement to increase their capacity to satisfy our supply needs. The occurrence of any of the foregoing factors would have a negative impact on our ability to deliver products to customers within committed time frames.\nWe may not be able to satisfy technical requirements, testing requirements, code requirements or other specifications under contracts and contract tenders.\nMany of our products are used in harsh environments and severe service applications. Our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids often set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements (including that they meet certain industrial code requirements, such as API, ASME or similar codes, or that our processes and facilities maintain ISO or similar certifications) for our products and services, which may also include extensive testing requirements. We anticipate that such code testing requirements will become more common in our contracts. We cannot assure that our products or facilities will be able to satisfy the specifications or requirements, or that we will be able to perform the full-scale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts, or that the costs of modifications to our products or facilities to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations. If our products or facilities are unable to satisfy such requirements, or we are unable to perform or satisfy any required full-scale testing, we may suffer reputational harm and our customers may cancel their contracts and/or seek new suppliers, and our business, results of operations or financial position may be adversely affected.\nA failure or breach of our information technology infrastructure, including as a result of cyber attacks or failures of data protection measures, could adversely impact our business and results of operations and expose us to potential liabilities.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. Accordingly, we rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our IT hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to computer viruses, natural disasters, incursions by intruders or hackers, failures in hardware or software, power fluctuations, cyber terrorists and other similar disruptions. In certain instances, our IT systems have failed to perform as anticipated, resulting in disruptions in operations and other adverse consequences. Should our IT systems materially fail in the future, it may result in numerous other adverse consequences, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of our operations, inappropriate disclosure of\nconfidential information, increased overhead costs, and loss of intellectual property, which could lead to liability to third parties or otherwise and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences or our insurers may refuse to make payment. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to prevent damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nIn addition, recent laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and laws enacted in certain U.S. jurisdictions, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.\nOur success depends on our ability to implement new technologies and services more efficiently and quickly than our competitors.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and implement new product designs and improvements that meet our customer\u2019s needs in a manner equal to or more effective than those offered by our competitors. If we are not able to continue to provide new and innovative services and technologies in a manner that allows us to meet evolving industry requirements at prices acceptable to our customers, our financial results would be negatively affected. In addition, some of our competitors are large national and multinational companies that we believe are able to devote greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources to research and develop more or better systems, services and technologies than we are able to do. Moreover, as a result of the currently depressed levels of customer activity, we may be unable to allocate sufficient amounts of capital to research and new product development activities, which may limit our ability to compete in the market and generate revenue.\nOur success will be affected by the use and protection of our proprietary technology. Due to the limitations of our intellectual property rights, our ability to exclude others from the use of our proprietary technology may be reduced. Furthermore, we may be adversely affected by disputes regarding intellectual property rights.\nOur success will be affected by our development and implementation of new product designs and improvements and by our ability to protect and maintain intellectual property assets related to these developments. Although in many cases our products are not protected by any registered intellectual property rights, in some cases we rely on a combination of patents and trade secret laws to establish and protect this proprietary technology.\nWe currently hold multiple U.S. and international patents and have several pending patent applications associated with our products and processes. Some work is conducted in international waters and, therefore, does not fall within the scope of any country\u2019s patent jurisdiction. As a result, we would be limited in the degree to which we can enforce our patents against infringement occurring in international waters and other \u201cnon-covered\u201d territories. Also, we do not have patents in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business and our patent portfolio will not protect all aspects of our business and may relate to obsolete or unusual methods, which would not prevent third parties from entering the same market.\nFrom time to time, our competitors have infringed upon, misappropriated, circumvented, violated or challenged the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property. In the future, we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. Our failure or inability to protect our proprietary information or successfully oppose intellectual property challenges against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. Moreover, third parties from time to time may initiate litigation against us by asserting that the conduct of our business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates their intellectual property rights. For example, in 2017, one of our subsidiaries filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment action of non-infringement against Tenaris Coiled Tubes, LLC. Tenaris subsequently filed counterclaims against our subsidiary and us alleging infringement on certain of its patents. We may not prevail in any such legal proceedings, and our products and services may be found to infringe, impair, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. Any legal proceeding concerning intellectual property is likely to be protracted and costly and is inherently unpredictable, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of its outcome. Further, our intellectual property rights may not have the value expected and such value is expected to change over time as new products are designed and improved.\nWe may incur liabilities, fines, penalties or additional costs, or we may be unable to sell to certain customers if we do not maintain safe operations.\nIf we fail to comply with safety regulations or maintain an acceptable level of safety at our facilities, we may incur fines, penalties or other liabilities, or we may be held criminally liable. In addition, a portion of our work force is made up of newer employees who are less experienced and therefore more prone to injury. As a result, new employees require ongoing training and a higher degree of oversight. We incur additional costs to encourage training and ensure proper oversight of these shorter service employees. Moreover, we incur costs in connection with equipment upgrades, or other costs to facilitate our compliance with safety regulations. Failure to maintain safe operations or achieve certain safety performance metrics could disqualify us from doing business with certain customers, particularly major oil companies.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nEffective internal control over financial processes and reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports that effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully. Our efforts to maintain internal control systems have not been successful in the past. The existence of a material weakness in the future or a failure of our internal controls could affect our ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of any such financing. The identification of a material weakness in the future could also cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. In addition, the entities that we acquire in the future may not maintain effective systems of internal control or we may encounter difficulties integrating our system of internal controls with those of acquired entities. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls and, as a result, fail to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed.\nFacility consolidations or expansions may subject us to risks of operating inefficiencies, construction delays and cost overruns.\nWe have consolidated and may continue to consolidate facilities to achieve operating efficiencies and reduce costs. These facility consolidations may be delayed and cause us to incur increased costs, product or service delivery delays, decreased responsiveness to customer needs, liabilities under terms and conditions of sale or other operational inefficiencies, or may not provide the benefits we anticipate. We may lose key personnel and operational knowledge that might lead to quality issues or delays in production.\nIn the future, we may grow our businesses through the construction of new facilities and expansions of our existing facilities. These projects, and any other capital asset construction projects that we may commence, are subject to similar risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022difficulties or delays in obtaining land;\n\u2022shortages of key equipment, materials or skilled labor;\n\u2022unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;\n\u2022unanticipated cost increases;\n\u2022weather interferences; and\n\u2022difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions.\nOur operations and our customers\u2019 operations are subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations that affect our and our customers\u2019 costs, prohibit or curtail our customers\u2019 operations in certain areas, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.\nOur business and our customers\u2019 businesses may be significantly affected by:\n\u2022federal, state and local U.S. and non-U.S. laws and other regulations relating to oilfield operations, worker safety and protection of the environment;\n\u2022changes in these laws and regulations;\n\u2022the level of enforcement of these laws and regulations; and\n\u2022interpretation of existing laws and regulations.\nIn addition, we depend on the demand for our products and services from the oil and natural gas industry. This demand is affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry in general. For example, the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas for economic or other policy reasons could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products. In addition, some non-U.S. countries adopt regulations or practices that provide an advantage to local oil companies in bidding for oil leases, or require local companies to perform oilfield services currently supplied by international service companies. To the extent that such companies are not our customers, or we are unable to develop relationships with them, our business may suffer. We cannot determine the extent to which our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations.\nBecause of our non-U.S. operations and sales, we are also subject to changes in non-U.S. laws and regulations that encourage or require hiring of local contractors or require non-U.S. contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. If we fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected.\nPotential legislation or regulations restricting the use of hydraulic fracturing could reduce demand for our products.\nCertain environmental advocacy groups and politicians have suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process, and have made claims that hydraulic fracturing techniques are harmful to surface water and drinking water resources. Various governmental entities (within and outside the U.S.) are in the process of studying, restricting, regulating or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing, directly or indirectly.\nThe EPA has asserted federal authority over hydraulic fracturing using fluids that contain \u201cdiesel fuel\u201d under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) Underground Injection Control Program and has issued permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing operations involving the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids in those states where the EPA is the permitting authority. Additionally, in March 2015, the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) issued final rules, including new requirements relating to public disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water, to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. These rules were rescinded by rule in December 2017; however, in January 2018, California and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California to challenge the BLM\u2019s rescission of the rules. The Northern District of California upheld the rescission in 2020, but this decision was then appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. This litigation is ongoing and future implementation of the BLM rules is uncertain at this time\nIn past sessions, Congress has considered, but not passed, the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities or impose bans or moratoria on these activities altogether. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely. For example, the Colorado state legislature passed a package of hydraulic fracturing regulations in April 2019. Under the new law, the state oil and natural gas agency must review well locations for environmental protection criteria. In addition, the legislation broadened the authority for local governments to further regulate or restrict hydraulic fracturing. In November 2019, the California governor\u2019s office imposed new regulations on hydraulic fracturing, including a moratorium on all new hydraulic fracturing permits pending review by a panel of scientists. In February 2018, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission released a protocol that requires operators to suspend hydraulic fracturing well completion operations in response to certain levels of seismic activity.\nIf new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, and production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which could adversely affect demand for our products and services from those customers.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted by changes in regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and development activity in response to significant environmental incidents.\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior implemented additional safety and certification requirements applicable to drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, imposed additional requirements with respect to exploration,\ndevelopment and production activities in U.S. waters and imposed a moratorium that delayed the approval of drilling plans and well permits in both deepwater and shallow-water areas due to the Macondo well incident. Although neither we nor our products were involved in the incident, the delays caused by the new regulations and requirements had an overall negative effect on drilling activity in U.S. waters, and to a certain extent, our financial results. Another similar environmental incident could result in similar drilling moratoria, and could result in increased federal, state, and international regulation of our and our customers\u2019 operations that could negatively impact our earnings, prospects and the availability and cost of insurance coverage. Any additional regulation of the exploration and production industry as a whole could result in fewer companies being financially qualified to operate offshore or onshore in the U.S. or in non-U.S. jurisdictions, resulting in higher operating costs for our customers and reduced demand for our products and services.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and operational safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things, regulate the management and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; require acquisition of environmental permits related to our operations; restrict the types, quantities, and concentrations of various materials that can be released into the environment; limit or prohibit operational activities in certain ecologically sensitive and other protected areas; regulate specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; require compliance with operational and equipment standards; impose testing, reporting and record keeping requirements; and require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with permits may result in the inability to conduct certain operational activities, assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements and the imposition of injunctions to prohibit certain activities or force future compliance. Certain environmental laws may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. In addition, these risks may be greater for us because the companies we acquire or have acquired may not have allocated sufficient resources and management focus to environmental compliance, potentially requiring rehabilitative efforts during the integration process or exposing us to liability before such rehabilitation occurs.\nThe trend in environmental regulation has been to impose increasingly stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment. The implementation of new laws and regulations could result in materially increased costs, stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability and increased capital expenditures and operating costs, particularly for our customers.\nOur business operations worldwide are subject to a number of U.S. federal laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Commerce Department, as well as similar laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions that govern our operations by virtue of our presence or activities there.\nWe rely on a large number of agents in non-U.S. countries that have been identified as posing a high risk of corrupt activities and whose local laws and customs differ significantly from those in the U.S. In many countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by the regulations applicable to us. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions, including the UK Bribery Act 2010, (\u201canti-corruption laws\u201d) prohibit corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. We may be held responsible for violations by our employees, contractors and agents for violations of anti-corruption laws. We may also be held responsible for violations by an acquired company that occur prior to an acquisition, or subsequent to an acquisition but before we are able to institute our compliance procedures. In addition, our non-U.S. competitors that are not subject to the FCPA or similar anti-corruption laws may be able to secure business or other preferential treatment in such countries by means that such laws prohibit with respect to us. The UK Bribery Act 2010 is broader in scope than the FCPA, applies to public and private sector corruption, and contains no facilitating payments exception. A violation of any of these laws, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation, be expensive to defend, impair our ability to do business, and cause us to incur civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions.\nCompliance with regulations relating to export controls, trade sanctions and embargoes administered by the countries in which we operate, including the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and similar regulations in non-U.S. jurisdictions also pose a risk to us. We cannot provide products or\nservices to certain countries, companies or individuals subject to trade sanctions of the U.S. and other countries. Furthermore, the laws and regulations concerning import activity, export record keeping and reporting, export controls and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges.\nWe are subject to litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, products, employees and other matters, including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations. Some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses. Our insurance does not cover all of our potential losses, and we are subject to various self-insured retentions and deductibles under our insurance. A judgment may be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured or which exceed the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters.\nThe number and cost of our current and future asbestos claims could be substantially higher than we have estimated and the timing of payment of claims could be sooner than we have estimated.\nOne of our subsidiaries has been and continues to be named as a defendant in asbestos related product liability actions. The actual amounts expended on asbestos-related claims in any year may be impacted by the number of claims filed, the nature of the allegations asserted in the claims, the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, and the number of settlements. As of December 31, 2020, our subsidiary has a net liability of $0.3 million for the estimated indemnity cost associated with the resolution of its current open claims and future claims anticipated to be filed during the next five years.\nDue to a number of uncertainties, the actual costs of resolving these pending claims could be substantially higher than the current estimate. Among these are uncertainties as to the ultimate number and type of lawsuits filed, the amounts of claim costs, the impact of bankruptcies of other companies with asbestos suits or of our insurers, and potential legislative changes and uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case. In addition, future claims beyond the five-year forecast period are possible, but the accrual does not cover losses that may arise from such additional future claims. Therefore, any such future claims could result in a loss.\nSignificant costs are incurred in defending asbestos claims and these costs are recorded at the time incurred. Receipt of reimbursement from our insurers may be delayed for a variety of reasons. In particular, if our primary insurers claim that certain policy limits have been exhausted, we may be delayed in receiving reimbursement due to the transition from one set of insurers to another. Our excess insurers may also dispute the claims of exhaustion, or may rely on certain policy requirements to delay or deny claims. Furthermore, the various per occurrence and aggregate limits in different insurance policies may result in extended negotiations or the denial of reimbursement for particular claims. For more information on the cost sharing agreements related to this risk, refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies.\nOur products are used in operations that are subject to potential hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry and, as a result, we are exposed to potential liabilities that could affect our financial condition and reputation.\nOur products are used in potentially hazardous completion, production and drilling applications in the oil and natural gas industry where an accident or a failure of a product can potentially have catastrophic consequences. Risks inherent to these applications, such as equipment malfunctions; failures; explosions; blowouts or uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids; and natural disasters on land or in deepwater or shallow-water environments, can cause personal injury; loss of life; suspension of operations; damage to formations; damage to facilities; business interruption and damage to or destruction of property, surface water and drinking water resources, equipment and the environment. These risks can be caused or contributed to by failure of, defects in or misuse of our products. In addition, we provide certain services that could cause, contribute to or be implicated in these events. If our products or services fail to meet specifications or are involved in accidents or failures, we could face warranty, contract or other litigation claims, which could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, and pollution or other environmental damages. In addition, failure of our products to operate properly or to meet specifications may increase costs by requiring additional engineering resources and services, replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to a customer. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover all liabilities. Further, insurance may not be\ngenerally available in the future or, if available, insurance premiums may make such insurance commercially unjustifiable. Moreover, even if we are successful in defending a claim, it could be time-consuming and costly to defend.\nIn addition, the frequency and severity of such incidents could affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our products or services if they view our safety record as unacceptable, which could cause us to lose customers and revenues. In addition, these risks may be greater for us because we may acquire companies that have not allocated significant resources and management focus to quality or safety, requiring rehabilitative efforts during the integration process. We may incur liabilities for losses associated with these newly acquired companies before we are able to rehabilitate such companies\u2019 quality, safety and environmental programs.\nOur acquisitions and dispositions may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nWe continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions, including purchases or sales of assets, businesses, investments, or joint venture interests. These transactions are intended to (but may not) result in the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, the offering of new products or services, the generation of cash or income, or the reduction of risk. Acquisition transactions may use cash on hand or be financed by additional borrowings or by the issuance of our common stock. These transactions may also affect our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. These transactions also involve risks, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022any acquisitions we attempt will be completed on the terms announced, or at all;\n\u2022any acquisitions would result in an increase in income or provide an adequate return of capital or other anticipated benefits;\n\u2022any acquisitions would be successfully integrated into our operations and internal controls;\n\u2022the due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition would uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure, including under the FCPA, or that we will appropriately quantify the exposure from known risks;\n\u2022any disposition would not result in decreased earnings, revenue, or cash flow;\n\u2022use of cash for acquisitions would not adversely affect our cash available for capital expenditures and other uses; or\n\u2022any dispositions, investments, or acquisitions, including integration efforts, would not divert management resources.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases and related divestment and other efforts could increase our operating costs or reduce demand for our products.\nEnvironmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the U.S. and other countries have focused considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. In response to scientific studies suggesting that emissions of GHGs, including carbon dioxide and methane, are contributing to the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic conditions, the U.S. Congress has considered adopting comprehensive legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through measures to promote the use of renewable energy and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. The Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) has already begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the federal Clean Air Act. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and certain other GHGs endanger public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Accordingly, the EPA has begun adopting rules under the Clean Air Act that, among other things, cover reductions in GHG emissions from motor vehicles, permits for certain large stationary sources of GHGs, and monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified GHG emission sources, including oil and natural gas exploration and production operations. Additionally, in May 2016, the EPA issued final new source performance standards governing methane emissions that impose more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions at new and modified oil and natural gas production, processing, storage and transmission facilities. However, in August 2020 the EPA rescinded methane and volatile organic compound emissions standards for new and modified oil and gas transmission and storage infrastructure, as well as methane limits for new and modified oil and gas production and processing equipment. The EPA also relaxed requirements for oil and gas operators to monitor emissions leaks. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the U.S., including oil and natural gas systems.\nEfforts have also been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. In 2015, the U.S. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement, which requires member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years. Although the U.S. had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement in November 2020, the Biden Administration officially reentered the U.S. into the agreement in February 2021.\nThe adoption of additional legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs to comply with new emissions-reduction or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, hydrocarbons that certain of our customers produce and reduce revenues by other of our customers who provide services to those exploration and production customers. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the regulatory efforts described above, there have also been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisers, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. If these efforts are successful, our ability to access capital markets may be limited and our stock price may be negatively impacted.\nMembers of the investment community have recently increased their focus on sustainability practices, including practices related to GHGs and climate change, in the oil and natural gas industry. As a result, we and our customers have come under increasing pressure to improve our sustainability practices. Some of our customers have begun to screen their service providers, including us, for compliance with sustainability metrics. Additionally, members of the investment community have begun to screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance before investing in our stock. If we are unable to establish adequate sustainability practices, we may lose customers, our stock price may be negatively impacted, our reputation may be negatively affected, and it may be more difficult for us to compete effectively. Our efforts to improve our sustainability practices in response to these pressures may increase our costs, and we may be forced to implement technologies that are not economically viable in order to improve our sustainability performance and to perform services for certain customers. Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events.\nFinally, increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of lawsuits or investigations brought by public and private entities against oil and natural gas companies in connection with their greenhouse gas emissions. Should we be targeted by any such litigation or investigations, we may incur liability, which, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, could be imposed without regard to the causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.\nA natural disaster, catastrophe or other event could result in severe property damage, which could curtail our operations.\nAdverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, ice or snow may damage or destroy our facilities, interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers\u2019 operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue, which may or may not be insured. For example, certain of our facilities located in Oklahoma and Pennsylvania have experienced suspensions in operations due to tornado activity or extreme cold weather conditions.\nSome of our operations involve risks of, among other things, property damage, which could curtail our operations. Disruptions in operations or damage to a manufacturing plant could reduce our ability to produce products and satisfy customer demand. In particular, we have offices and manufacturing facilities in Houston, Texas, and in various places throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast region. These offices and facilities are particularly susceptible to severe tropical storms and hurricanes, which may disrupt our operations. Damage to one or more of our manufacturing facilities by severe weather or any other disaster, accident, catastrophe or event, could significantly interrupt our operations. Similar interruptions could result from damage to production or other facilities that provide supplies or other raw materials to our plants or other stoppages arising from factors beyond our control. These interruptions might involve significant damage to property, among other things, and repairs might take a significant amount of time. For example, in the third quarter 2017, we were impacted by idled facilities and operations directly related to Hurricane Harvey\u2019s widespread damage in Texas and Louisiana. As a result, our financial results were negatively impacted by foregone revenue and under-absorption of manufacturing costs, and, indirectly, due to supplier and logistical delays.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law and our rights plan could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe existence of some provisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law and our rights plan could delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022a classified board of directors, so that only approximately one-third of our directors are elected each year;\n\u2022authority of our board to fill vacancies and determine its size;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022limitations on the removal of directors; and\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings.\nIn addition, our amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders. Furthermore, if SCF\u2019s ownership is reduced to less than 15%, certain restrictions under Delaware law on business combinations with greater than 15% stockholders will begin to apply to us.\nFurther, in April 2020, our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan, implementing what is commonly known as a \u201cpoison pill.\u201d This poison pill significantly increases the costs that would be incurred by an unwanted third party acquirer if such party owns or commences a tender offer for 10% (or 20% in the case of a holder who or which is entitled to file and files a statement on Schedule 13G) or more of our outstanding common stock. The existence of this poison pill could delay, deter or prevent a takeover of us. The shareholder rights plan is scheduled to expire in April 2021.\nLESA, through SCF Partners (\u201cSCF\u201d), may significantly influence the outcome of stockholder voting and may exercise this voting power in a manner adverse to our other stockholders.\nAs of February 26, 2021, SCF held approximately 846 thousand shares of our common stock, equal to approximately 15% of the outstanding common stock at that date. LESA is the ultimate general partner of SCF and will exert significant influence over us, including over the outcome of most matters requiring a stockholder vote,\nsuch as the election of directors, adoption of amendments to our charter and bylaws and approval of transactions involving a change of control. LESA\u2019s interests may differ from our other stockholders, and SCF may vote its common stock in a manner that may adversely affect those stockholders.\nSCF is a party to a registration rights agreement with us, which requires us to effect the registration of its shares in certain circumstances. SCF exercised such rights in the past. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by SCF, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nCertain of our directors may have conflicts of interest because they are also directors or officers of SCF. The resolution of these conflicts of interest may not be in the best interests of our Company or our other stockholders.\nCertain of our directors, namely David C. Baldwin and Andrew L. Waite, are currently officers of LESA. In addition, our CEO, directly and through a trust for his children who are primary beneficiaries, holds an ownership interest in various SCF funds. These positions may create conflicts of interest because of the ownership interest these directors and Mr. Gaut maintain. Duties as directors or officers of LESA may conflict with such individuals\u2019 duties as one of our directors or officers regarding business dealings and other matters between SCF and us. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in the best interest of our Company or our other stockholders. Please read \u201cWe have renounced any interest in specified business opportunities, and SCF and its director nominees on our board of directors generally have no obligation to offer us those opportunities.\u201d\nWe have renounced any interest in specified business opportunities, and SCF and its director nominees on our board of directors generally have no obligation to offer us those opportunities.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, so long as we have a director or officer who is affiliated with SCF (an \u201cSCF Nominee\u201d) and for a continuous period of one year thereafter, we renounce any interest or expectancy in any business opportunity in which any member of the SCF group participates or desires or seeks to participate in and that involves any aspect of the energy equipment or services business or industry, other than (i) any business opportunity that is brought to the attention of an SCF Nominee solely in such person\u2019s capacity as a director or officer of our Company and with respect to which no other member of the SCF group independently receives notice or otherwise identifies such opportunity and (ii) any business opportunity that is identified by the SCF group solely through the disclosure of information by or on behalf of our Company. We refer to SCF and its other affiliates and its portfolio companies as the SCF group. We are not prohibited from pursuing any business opportunity with respect to which we have renounced any interest.\nSCF has investments in other oilfield service companies that may compete with us, and SCF and its affiliates, other than our Company, may invest in other such companies in the future. LESA, the ultimate general partner of SCF, has an internal policy that discourages it from investing in two or more portfolio companies with substantially overlapping industry segments and geographic areas. However, LESA\u2019s internal policy does not restrict the management or operation of its other individual portfolio companies from competing with us. Pursuant to LESA\u2019s policy, LESA may allocate any potential opportunities to the existing portfolio company where LESA determines, in its discretion, such opportunities are the most logical strategic and operational fit. As a result, LESA or its affiliates may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and may direct such opportunities to its other portfolio companies, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunities. Furthermore, LESA does not have a specific policy with regard to allocation of financial professionals and they are under no obligation to provide us with financial professionals.", "PERMNO": 13337, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "FET"}
