{"cik": "1510295", "company": "Marathon Petroleum Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our common stock. Some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate, while others relate to the ownership of our common stock.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nA substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth, the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend.\nOur operating results, cash flows, future rate of growth, the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products. Historically, refining and marketing margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile. Our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions, including the price of crude oil. The price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nworldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and refined products;\n\u2022\nthe cost of crude oil and other feedstocks to be manufactured into refined products;\n\u2022\nthe prices realized for refined products;\n\u2022\ntransportation infrastructure availability, local market conditions and operation levels of other refineries in our markets;\n\u2022\nutilization rates of refineries;\n\u2022\nnatural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of OPEC to agree to and maintain production controls;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, threatened or actual terrorist incidents, armed conflict, or other global political conditions;\n\u2022\nlocal weather conditions;\n\u2022\nseasonality of demand in our marketing area due to increased highway traffic in the spring and summer months;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and\n\u2022\nlocal, regional, national and worldwide economic conditions.\nSome of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. The longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain. We purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products. Price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. We also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers. Price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLower refining and marketing margins may reduce the amount of refined products we produce, which may reduce our revenues, income from operations and cash flows. Significant reductions in refining and marketing margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures, impair the carrying value of our assets (such as property, plant and equipment, inventory or goodwill), and decrease or eliminate our share repurchase activity and our base dividend.\nOur operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. Failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to business interruptions such as scheduled refinery turnarounds, unplanned maintenance or unplanned events such as explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents, power outages, severe weather, labor disputes, or other natural or man-made disasters, such as acts of terrorism. For example, pipelines or railroads provide a nearly-exclusive form of transportation of crude oil to, or refined products from, some of our refineries. In such instances, a prolonged interruption, material reduction or cessation of service of such a pipeline or railway, whether due to private party or governmental action or other reason, could materially and adversely affect the operations, profitability and cash flows of the impacted refinery.\nExplosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations may result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities.\nIn addition, we operate in and adjacent to environmentally sensitive waters where tanker, pipeline, rail car and refined product transportation and storage operations are closely regulated by federal, state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups. Our coastal refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks by tanker. In addition, our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks by rail car, truck and barge. Transportation and storage of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined products over and adjacent to water involves inherent risk and subjects us to the provisions of the OPA-90 and state laws in U.S. coastal and Great Lakes states and states bordering inland waterways on which we operate, as well as international laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. If we are unable to promptly and adequately contain any accident or discharge involving tankers, pipelines, rail cars or above ground storage tanks transporting or storing crude oil, other feedstocks or refined products, we may be subject to substantial liability. In addition, the service providers we have contracted to aid us in a discharge response may be unavailable due to weather conditions, governmental regulations or other local or global events. International, federal or state rulings could divert our response resources to other global events.\nWe do not insure against all potential losses, and, therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.\nWe maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many, but not all, potential liabilities arising from operating hazards. Uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards, including but not limited to, explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases, cybersecurity breaches or other incidents involving our assets or operations, could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Marine vessel charter agreements may not provide complete indemnity for oil spills, and any marine charterer\u2019s liability insurance we carry may not cover all losses. Historically, we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates.\nWe rely on the performance of our information technology systems, and the interruption or failure of any information technology system, including an interruption or failure due to a cybersecurity breach, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information technology systems, including our network infrastructure and cloud applications, for the effective operation of our business. We rely on such systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, including financial records and personally identifiable information such as employee, customer, investor and payroll data, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including our supply chain, pipeline operations, gathering and processing operations, retail sales, credit card payments and authorizations at our retail outlets, financial transactions, banking and numerous other processes and transactions. These information systems involve data network and telecommunications, Internet access and website functionality, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications, including those that are critical to the safe operation of our business. Our systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks and other events. We also face various other cybersecurity threats from criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusion, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance, including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable.\nTo protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack, we have implemented multiple layers of cybersecurity protections, infrastructure protection technologies, disaster recovery plans and employee training. While we have invested significant amounts in the protection of our technology systems and maintain what we believe are adequate security controls over personally identifiable customer, investor and employee data, there can be no guarantee such plans, to the extent they are in place, will be effective.\nCertain vendors have access to sensitive information, including personally identifiable customer, investor and employee data and a breakdown of their technology systems or infrastructure as a result of a cyber-attack or otherwise could result in unauthorized disclosure of such information. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or personally identifiable information, including by cyber-attacks or other security breach, could cause loss of data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under federal and state laws, reduce our customers\u2019 willingness to do business with us, disrupt the services we provide to customers and subject us to litigation and investigations, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. State and federal cybersecurity legislation could also impose new requirements, which could increase our cost of doing business.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business.\nWe compete with a broad range of refining and marketing companies, including certain multinational oil companies. Competitors with integrated operations with exploration and production resources and broader access to resources may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions and to bear the risks inherent in the refining industry. For example, competitors that engage in exploration and production of crude oil may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.\nWe also face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline, diesel fuel and merchandise. Our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers, and other well-recognized national or regional retail outlets, often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices. Several non-traditional retailers such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business. These non-traditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow. Because of their diversity, integration of operations, experienced management and greater financial resources, these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market. In addition, these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the pump and in the store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales. These activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts, adversely affecting our profit margins.\nAdditionally, the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe development, availability and marketing of alternative and competing fuels in the retail market could adversely impact our business. We compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel needs of our consumers. Increased competition from these alternatives as a result of governmental regulations, technological advances and consumer demand could have an impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability.\nWe are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and refined products.\nWe utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries. In addition to our own operational risks discussed above, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations or third-party actions. A prolonged disruption of the ability of the trucks, pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.\nWe conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partners. Our joint venture partners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint-venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur losses to our business as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions.\nWe currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future. A failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions. To the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective, we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred.\nWe have significant debt obligations; therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile, a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us, or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally.\nAt December 31, 2018, our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations were $27.98 billion, including $13.86 billion of obligations of MPLX and $5.01 billion of obligations of ANDX. We may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future.\nOur indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other purposes.\nA decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity, including unsecured credit extended by third-party suppliers, or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and/or limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit. Our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn\nentirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any changes in our credit capacity or credit profile could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to $750 million depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables. In periods of lower prices, we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility.\nHistoric or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate.\nWe currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. Our operations, including those of MPLX and ANDX, and those of our predecessors and Andeavor\u2019s predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. While an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us, in class-action litigation, large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages. Attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims, including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages. We are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. If we are not able to successfully defend such litigation, it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. In addition to substantial liability, plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nApproximately 4,780 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of these employees, approximately 1,465 employees at our Galveston Bay, Mandan and Martinez refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements which were set to expire on January 31, 2019. The parties continue their negotiations toward a new agreement, and are working under rolling extensions. Approximately 425 employees at our Martinez Chemical Plant, our Los Angeles refinery and our Galveston Bay refinery are covered by collective bargaining agreements expiring over the next several months. Approximately 410 hourly employees at Speedway are represented under collective bargaining agreements. The majority of these employees work at certain retail locations in New York and New Jersey under agreements which expire on March 14, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. The remaining Speedway represented employees are drivers in Minnesota under an agreement which expires in 2021. Approximately 300 employees at our St. Paul Park and Gallup refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire in 2020. Approximately 1,620 employees at our Anacortes, Canton, Catlettsburg, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake City refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are due to expire in 2022. The remaining 560 hourly represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2024. These contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements. Any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, California requires refinery owners to pay prevailing wages to contract craft workers and restricts refiners\u2019 ability to hire qualified employees to a limited pool of applicants. Legislation or changes in regulations could result in labor shortages higher labor costs, and an increased risk that contract employees become joint employees, which could trigger bargaining issues, employment discrimination liability issues as well as wage and benefit consequences, especially during critical maintenance and construction periods.\nTwo of our subsidiaries act as general partners of publicly traded master limited partnerships, which may involve a greater exposure to certain legal liabilities than existed under our historic business operations.\nOne of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of MPLX, a publicly traded MLP. Another of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of ANDX, a publicly traded MLP. We acquired control of ANDX\u2019s general partner through the Andeavor acquisition. Our control of the general partners of MPLX and ANDX may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest related to MPLX and ANDX. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf foreign investment in us or MPLX exceeds certain levels, MPLX could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Shipping Act of 1916 and Merchant Marine Act of 1920, which we refer to collectively as the Maritime Laws, generally require that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be owned by U.S. citizens. Among other requirements to establish citizenship, entities that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by U.S. citizens. If we fail to maintain compliance with the Maritime Laws, MPLX would be prohibited from operating vessels in the U.S. inland waters. Such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of Marathon Oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and separation and distribution agreement we entered into with Marathon Oil that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough the Spinoff occurred in mid-2011, certain liabilities of Marathon Oil could become our obligations. For example, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \u201cCode\u201d) and related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Marathon Oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the Spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire Marathon Oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. In connection with the Spinoff, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Marathon Oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Marathon Oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and Marathon Oil. However, if Marathon Oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes. Other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities.\nAlso pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, following the Spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, whether accruing before, on or after the Spinoff. We also agreed to be responsible for, and indemnify Marathon Oil with respect to, all taxes arising as a result of the Spinoff (or certain internal restructuring transactions) failing to qualify as transactions under Sections 368(a) and 355 of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the Spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement. In addition, we agreed to indemnify Marathon Oil for specified tax-related liabilities associated with our 2005 acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from Ashland Inc. Our indemnification obligations to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries, officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap. If we are required to indemnify Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. At this time, we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts.\nAlso, in connection with the Spinoff, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with Marathon Oil that provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions that were required to effect the Spinoff, certain conditions to the Spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and Marathon Oil with respect to and resulting from the Spinoff. Among other things, the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Spinoff, as well as certain obligations of Marathon Oil assumed by us. Our obligations to indemnify Marathon Oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities. Marathon Oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by Marathon Oil, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Marathon Oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, that Marathon Oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that Marathon Oil\u2019s insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the Spinoff. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Marathon Oil or its insurers any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. The tax liabilities and underlying liabilities in the event Marathon Oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nSignificant acquisitions in the future will involve the integration of new assets or businesses and present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nSignificant future transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses will present potential risks, which may include, among others:\n\u2022\nInaccurate assumptions about future synergies, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs;\n\u2022\nAn inability to successfully integrate assets or businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nA decrease in our liquidity resulting from using a portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to finance transactions;\n\u2022\nA significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance transactions;\n\u2022\nThe assumption of unknown environmental and other liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n\u2022\nThe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022\nThe incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges.\nA significant decrease or delay in oil and natural gas production in MPLX\u2019s or ANDX\u2019s areas of operation, whether due to sustained declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices, natural declines in well production, or otherwise, may adversely affect MPLX\u2019s or ANDX\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, and could reduce their ability to make distributions to us.\nA significant portion of MPLX\u2019s operations are dependent upon production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells owned by its producer customers, which will naturally decline over time, which means that MPLX\u2019s cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time. To maintain or increase throughput levels and the utilization rate of MPLX\u2019s facilities, MPLX must continually obtain new oil, natural gas and NGL supplies, which depends in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities. Similarly, ANDX\u2019s operations are dependent in part on the production of crude oil in the Bakken region and the production of natural gas and NGLs in the Green River, Uinta and Williston basins.\nWe have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of MPLX\u2019s or ANDX\u2019s operations, the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline. In addition, we have no control over producers or their production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, prevailing and projected energy prices, drilling costs per Mcf or barrel, demand for hydrocarbons, operational challenges, access to downstream markets, the level of reserves, geological considerations, governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital. Because of these factors, even if new oil or natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by MPLX or ANDX assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. If MPLX and ANDX are not able to obtain new supplies of oil, natural gas or NGLs to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on their pipelines and the utilization rates of their facilities would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations and financial condition and could reduce their ability to make distributions to us.\nDecreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity, production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves. The prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs depend upon factors beyond our control, including global and local demand, production levels, changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications, imports and exports, seasonality and weather conditions, economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations. Sustained periods of low prices could result in producers also significantly curtailing or limiting their oil and gas drilling operations which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs to MPLX\u2019s and ANDX\u2019s facilities and adversely affect their revenues and cash available for distribution to us. This impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of MPLX\u2019s commodity-based contracts, which are more directly impacted by changes in natural gas and NGL prices than its fee-based contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a Btu equivalent basis than NGL products. In addition, the purchase and resale of natural gas and NGLs in the ordinary course exposes our Midstream operations to volatility in natural gas or NGL prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales and the potential difference in the price associated with each transaction, and direct exposure may also occur naturally as a result of production processes. Also, the significant volatility in natural gas, NGL and oil prices could adversely impact MPLX\u2019s or ANDX\u2019s unit price, thereby increasing its distribution yield and cost of capital. Such impacts could adversely impact MPLX\u2019s and ANDX\u2019s ability to execute its long-term organic growth projects, satisfy obligations to its customers and make distributions to unitholders at intended levels, and may also result in non-cash impairments of long-lived assets or goodwill or other-than-temporary non-cash impairments of our equity method investments.\nSignificant stockholders may attempt to effect changes at our company or acquire control over our company, which could impact the pursuit of business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our company. Campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies. As a result, stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our assets are located, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe do not own all of the land on which certain of our assets are located, particularly our midstream assets, but rather obtain the rights to construct and operate such assets on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Therefore, we are subject to the possibility of more burdensome terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if our leases, rights-of-way or other property rights lapse or terminate or it is determined that we do not have valid leases, rights-of-way or other property rights. Our loss of these rights, including loss through our inability to renew leases, right-of-way agreements or permits on satisfactory terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE ANDEAVOR ACQUISITION\nThe Andeavor acquisition may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to MPC\u2019s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share, which may negatively affect the market price of shares of MPC common stock.\nThe Andeavor acquisition may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to MPC\u2019s earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share. Earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share in the future are based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. In addition, future events and conditions could decrease or delay any accretion, result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected, including:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in energy market conditions;\n\u2022\ncommodity prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;\n\u2022\nproduction levels;\n\u2022\noperating results;\n\u2022\ncompetitive conditions;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations affecting the energy business;\n\u2022\ncapital expenditure obligations;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected integration costs;\n\u2022\nlower than expected synergies; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nAny dilution of, or decrease or delay of any accretion to, MPC\u2019s earnings per share or cash flow from operations per share could cause the price of MPC\u2019s common stock to decline.\nMPC has incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in connection with the Andeavor acquisition, which may be in excess of those anticipated by MPC.\nMPC has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the Andeavor acquisition. MPC expects to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial.\nMPC will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. Although MPC expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow MPC to offset integration-related costs\nover time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. See the risk factor below entitled \u201cThe integration of Andeavor into MPC may not be as successful as anticipated.\u201d\nThe costs described above, as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses, could materially and adversely affect MPC\u2019s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe integration of Andeavor into MPC may not be as successful as anticipated.\nThe Andeavor acquisition involves numerous operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, tax and other risks; potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; and uncertainties related to design, operation and integration of Andeavor\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Difficulties in integrating Andeavor into MPC may result in legacy Andeavor assets performing differently than expected, in operational challenges or in the failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among other factors:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully integrate the businesses of Andeavor into MPC in a manner that permits MPC to achieve the full revenue and cost savings anticipated from the merger;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing the larger, more complex, integrated business;\n\u2022\nnot realizing anticipated operating synergies or incurring unexpected costs to realize such synergies;\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees;\n\u2022\nintegrating relationships with customers, vendors and business partners;\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating Andeavor\u2019s operations into MPC; and\n\u2022\nthe disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nMPC\u2019s results may suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the Andeavor acquisition.\nMPC\u2019s success depends, in part, on its ability to manage its expansion following the Andeavor acquisition, which poses numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate the operations and business of Andeavor into its existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers, vendors and business partners.\nMPC may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Andeavor acquisition.\nThe success of the Andeavor acquisition depends, in part, on MPC\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining MPC\u2019s and Andeavor\u2019s businesses, including the annual gross, run-rate, commercial and corporate synergies that MPC expects to realize within the first three years after the combination. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Andeavor acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, may require more non-recurring costs and expenditures to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects. Some of the assumptions that MPC has made, such as with respect to anticipated: operating synergies or the costs associated with realizing such synergies; significant long-term cash flow generation; the benefit from a substantial increase in scale and geographic diversity; complementary growth platforms for both midstream and retail businesses; positioning for potentially significant benefits from the International Maritime Organization change in specifications for marine bunker fuel; the expansion in opportunities for logistics growth in crude oil production basins and regions; further optimization of crude supply; and the continuation of MPC\u2019s investment grade credit profile, may not be realized. The integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. There could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the Andeavor acquisition that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence.\nWe have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.\nWe accounted for the Andeavor and other acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets and liabilities of the acquired business be recorded to our balance sheet at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recognized as goodwill.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our balance sheet reflected $20.2 billion and $3.4 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets, respectively. These amounts include the preliminary estimates of goodwill and other intangible assets of $16.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, recognized in connection with the Andeavor acquisition. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material non-cash charges relating to such impairment. Our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nMeeting the requirements of evolving environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVarious laws and regulations are expected to impose increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our operations, which may reduce our refining and marketing margin. Laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following:\n\u2022\nthe emission or discharge of materials into the environment,\n\u2022\nsolid and hazardous waste management,\n\u2022\npollution prevention,\n\u2022\ngreenhouse gas emissions,\n\u2022\nclimate change,\n\u2022\ncharacteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels,\n\u2022\npublic and employee safety and health,\n\u2022\ninherently safer technology, and\n\u2022\nfacility security.\nThe specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas, crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes. We may be required to make expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe EPA\u2019s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (\u201cNAAQS\u201d) are among the regulations that impact our operations. In October 2015, the EPA reduced the primary (health) ozone NAAQS to 70 ppb from the prior ozone level of 75 ppb. On November 6, 2017, the EPA finalized ozone attainment/unclassifiable designations under the new standard. In actions dated April 30, 2018, and July 25, 2018, the EPA finalized nonattainment designations for certain areas under the lower primary ozone standard. In some areas, these nonattainment designations could result in increased costs associated with, or result in cancellation or delay of, capital projects at our facilities. States will also be required to adopt SIPs for nonattainment areas. These SIPs may include NOx and/or VOC reductions that could result in increased costs to our facilities. We cannot predict the various SIP requirements at this time. The EPA announced that it plans to review the NAAQS level for particulate matter (\u201cPM\u201d). A reduction in the PM NAAQS and subsequent designation of nonattainment could also result in increased costs associated with, or result in cancellation or delay of, capital projects at our facilities.\nThe EISA established increases in fuel mileage standards. The Department of Transportation\u2019s National Highway Safety Administration and the EPA work in conjunction to establish CAFE standards and greenhouse gas emission standards for light-duty vehicles that become more stringent over time. In addition, pursuant to a waiver granted by the EPA, California and other states have enacted laws that require vehicle emission reductions. Increases in fuel mileage standards and requirements for zero emission vehicles may reduce demand for refined product.\nThe EISA also expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) program administered by the EPA. Governmental regulations encouraging the use of new or alternative fuels could pose a competitive threat to our operations. The EISA required the total\nvolume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the U.S. to reach 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. The RFS presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries, and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. Gasoline consumption has been lower than forecasted by the EPA, which has led to concerns that the renewable fuel volumes may not be met. On November 30, 2018, EPA finalized RFS volume requirements for the year 2019, and the biomass-based diesel volume requirement for year 2020. The EPA used its cellulosic waiver authority to reduce the volumes for 2019 from the statutory amounts to the following: 19.92 billion gallons total renewable fuel; 4.92 billion gallons advanced biofuel; and 418 million gallons cellulosic biofuel. The EPA set the biomass-based diesel volume requirement for 2020 at 2.43 billion gallons, which is significantly greater than the statutory floor of 1.0 billion gallons.\nTax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been, which may further reduce refined product margins. The tax incentives and subsidies are causing uncertainties because they have expired and been reinstituted retroactively. The biodiesel credit, for example, expired at the end of 2016 and was retroactively reinstated in early 2018. It is not certain whether the credit will be reinstituted beyond 2018.\nOn March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm, while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. Since 2014, we have made approximately $490 million in capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards. For 2019, we expect an additional $260 million of capital expenditures to comply with these standards.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could delay or impede producer\u2019s gas production or result in reduced volumes available for our midstream assets to gather, process and fractionate. While we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, we do provide gathering, processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by our customers as a result of such operations. If federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations and increase producers\u2019 costs of compliance.\nClimate change and greenhouse gas emission regulation could affect our operations, energy consumption patterns and regulatory obligations, any of which could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) and other emissions are in various phases of consideration, promulgation or implementation. These include actions to develop international, federal, regional or statewide programs, which could require reductions in our greenhouse gas or other emissions, establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for our refined products. Requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.\nFor example, in California, the state legislature adopted SB 32 in 2016. SB 32 set a cap on emissions of 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 but did not establish a particular mechanism to achieve that target. The legislature also adopted a companion bill, AB 197, that most significantly directs the CARB to prioritize direct emission reductions on large stationary sources. In 2017, the state legislature adopted AB 398 which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40% reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in SB 32. In 2009, CARB adopted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (\u201cLCFS\u201d). The LCFS was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 20% reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030. Compliance is demonstrated by blending lower carbon intensity biofuels into gasoline and diesel or by purchasing credits. Compliance with each of the cap and trade and LCFS programs is demonstrated through a market-based credit system. Other states are proposing, or have already promulgated, low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. If we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers, sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase, we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits, or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRegional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex, subject to change and considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility, legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy. Increasing concerns about climate change have also resulted in a number of international and national measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Additional stricter measures can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition.\nInternational climate change-related efforts, such as the 2015 United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement, may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations. Though the United States has announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, withdrawal\nit is not possible until November 2019 at the earliest. If the United States declines to withdraw, the extent of such regulation and the cost associated with compliance cannot be predicted.\nWe could also face increased climate-related litigation with respect to our operations or products. Governmental and other entities in California, New York, Maryland and Rhode Island have filed lawsuits against coal, gas, oil and petroleum companies, including the Company. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. There remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, as well as their potential effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nRegulatory and other requirements concerning the transportation of crude oil and other commodities by rail may cause increases in transportation costs or limit the amount of crude oil that we can transport by rail.\nWe rely on a variety of systems to transport crude oil, including rail. Rail transportation is regulated by federal, state and local authorities. New regulations or changes in existing regulations could result in increased compliance expenditures. For example, in 2015 the U.S. Department of Transportation issued new standards and regulations applicable to crude-by-rail transportation (Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains). These or other regulations that require the reduction of volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail, change the design or standards for rail cars used to transport the crude oil we purchase, change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil, or require any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering North American crude oil by rail could increase the time required to move crude oil from production areas to our refineries, increase the cost of rail transportation and decrease the efficiency of shipments of crude oil by rail within our operations. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSevere weather events and other climate conditions may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations.\nWe have mature systems in place to manage potential acute physical risks, such as floods, hurricane-force winds, wildfires and snowstorms, and potential chronic physical risks, such as higher ocean levels. If any such events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. Specifically, where appropriate, we are hardening and modernizing assets against weather damage and ensuring we have resiliency measures in place, such as storm-specific readiness plans. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to protect our assets and operations from such physical risks and employ the evolving technologies and processes available to mitigate such risks. To the extent such severe weather events or other climate conditions increase in frequency and severity, we may be required to modify operations and incur costs that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPlans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. Such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies.\nOur anticipated growth and planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. A portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets. However, policy decisions relating to the production, refining, transportation and marketing of carbon-based fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups. One of the ways we may grow our business is through the construction of new pipelines or the expansion of existing ones. The construction of a new pipeline or the expansion of an existing pipeline, by adding horsepower or pump stations or by adding additional pipelines along existing pipelines, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, and legal uncertainties, most of which are beyond our control. The approval process for storage and transportation projects has become increasingly challenging, due in part to state and local concerns related to pipelines, negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry, and concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions downstream of pipeline operations. In addition, government disruptions, such as a U.S. federal government shutdown, may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business. We have experienced construction delays related to these factors as a result of the U.S. federal government\u2019s recent shutdown. Our expansion or construction projects may not be completed on schedule (or at all) or at the budgeted cost. In addition, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if we build a new pipeline, the construction will occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project. Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results, thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows.\nLarge capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date, negatively impacting project returns. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nDelays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndenial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits;\n\u2022\nunplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;\n\u2022\nshortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;\n\u2022\nmarket-related increases in a project\u2019s debt or equity financing costs; and\n\u2022\nnonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.\nAny one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. If we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing margins.\nThe profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. A portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, production companies and trading companies, including suppliers from Canada, the Middle East and various other international locations. The market for crude oil and other feedstocks is largely a world market. We are, therefore, subject to the attendant political, geographic and economic risks of such a market. If one or more major supply sources were temporarily or permanently eliminated, we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our operations, sales of refined products and refining and marketing margins could be adversely affected, materially and adversely impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks arising from our non-U.S. operations and generally to worldwide political and economic developments.\nWe have expanded the scope of our non-U.S. operations through the Andeavor acquisition, particularly in Mexico, South America and Asia. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by disruptions in any of these markets, including economic instability, restrictions on the transfer of funds, duties and tariffs, transportation delays, import and export controls, changes in governmental policies, labor unrest, security issues involving key personnel and changing regulatory and political environments. In addition, if trade relationships deteriorate with these countries, if existing trade agreements are modified or terminated, new economic sanctions relevant to such jurisdictions are passed or if taxes, border adjustments or tariffs make trading with these countries more costly, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are required to comply with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. Our compliance policies and programs mandate compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws but may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance. Our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents. Actual or alleged violations of\nthese laws could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant legal expenses, and could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMore broadly, political and economic factors in global markets could impact crude oil and other feedstock supplies and could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways. Hostilities in the Middle East or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products, NGLs and natural gas. Additionally, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult and/or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. Additionally, tax policy, legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability. For example, the U.S. government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products, NGLs, natural gas or the conduct of business in or with certain foreign countries. In addition, foreign countries could restrict imports, investments or commercial transactions.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, payroll, franchise, withholding and property taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities, and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties.\nTerrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets in general, including the nation\u2019s refining, pipeline and terminal infrastructure, may be future targets of terrorist organizations. The threat of terrorist attacks has subjected our operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attacks on our facilities, those of our customers and, in some cases, those of other pipelines, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATING TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nProvisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company, dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity.\nThe existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u2022\nproviding that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board;\n\u2022\nproviding for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nproviding that only our board of directors may fill board vacancies;\n\u2022\nlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nestablishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\nproviding that our directors may only be removed for cause;\n\u2022\nauthorizing a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us; and\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal, and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nFinally, to facilitate compliance with the Maritime Laws, our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by non-U.S. citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares. We may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by non-U.S. citizens to exceed 23 percent. Our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock. These limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to non-U.S. citizens due to the limitations on ownership by non-U.S. citizens. Any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12872, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "MPC"}
