{"cik": "948072", "company": "BIRNER DENTAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe Company is heavily dependent upon the recruitment and retention of dentists and other personnel.\nThe profitability and operations of the Company\u2019s Offices heavily depend on the availability and successful recruitment and retention of dentists, dental assistants, dental hygienists, specialists, and other personnel. The Company\u2019s results of operations were adversely impacted in 2016 by the loss of dentists and other personnel and challenges presented in recruiting and replacing such personnel. The Company may not be able to recruit or retain dentists and other personnel for its Offices, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Dental Service Model.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness creates risks, and its Credit Facility contains financial and other covenants that may limit its flexibility.\nOn March 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Guaranty Bank and Trust Company, which was subsequently amended, most recently on March 30, 2017 (as amended, the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company. The Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants. As amended by the March 2017 amendment, the Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain (i) a funded debt-to-EBITDA ratio of no more than 2.5 to 1.00 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2017 and thereafter, (ii) net worth of at least $1.0 million (increased by 25% of any net income after taxes of the Company in 2017 and thereafter), and (iii) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.00 for the quarter ending December 31, 2017 and each quarter thereafter, and to generate at least $870,000 of EBITDA in each of the first three quarters of 2017. During 2016, dividends and stock repurchases were prohibited under the Credit Facility, and, as a result of the March 2017 amendment to the Credit Facility, dividends and stock repurchases are not currently permitted under the Credit Facility. In addition, capital expenditures may not exceed $180,000 per quarter. This indebtedness and these restrictions could limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain future financing, make capital expenditures, pay dividends, withstand economic downturns or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, any of which could place the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors that have less debt and are not subject to such restrictions. The March 2017 amendment to the Credit Facility also included a forbearance by the bank regarding covenant defaults by the Company with respect to the then-existing funded debt-to-EBITDA ratio of no more than 3.15 to 1.00 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.35 to 1.00 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and EBITDA of at least $650,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The forbearance remains in effect provided that the Company complies with the amended Credit Agreement covenants. There can be no assurances that the bank will not change the terms of the Credit Facility or cease to forbear or continue to extend credit to the Company. Any such actions or failure by the Company to maintain compliance with the Credit Facility in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company may need additional capital and there is no guarantee additional financing would be available.\nImplementation of the Company\u2019s expansion strategy has required significant capital resources. Such resources, which have included available cash and bank borrowings, have been used to establish additional de novo Offices and maintain and upgrade the Company\u2019s management information systems, and for the effective integration, operation and expansion of the Offices. The Company historically has primarily used cash and promissory notes as consideration in acquisitions of dental practices. If the Company\u2019s capital requirements exceed cash flow generated from operations and borrowings available under the Company\u2019s existing bank credit facility or any successor credit facility, the Company may need to issue additional equity securities or incur additional debt. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, dilution to the Company\u2019s existing shareholders may result. Additional debt or non-Common Stock equity financings could be required to the extent that the Common Stock fails to maintain a market value sufficient to warrant its use for future financing needs. If additional funds are raised through the incurrence of debt, such debt instruments will likely contain restrictive financial, maintenance and security covenants. The Company may not be able to obtain additional required capital on satisfactory terms, if at all. The failure to raise the funds necessary to finance the Company\u2019s operations or the Company\u2019s other capital requirements could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to pursue its strategy and on its business, financial condition and operating results. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s business could be negatively affected as a result of a potential proxy contest for the election of directors and proposal to certain amend certain aspects of the Company\u2019s governing documents at its 2017 annual meeting and other activist shareholder activities.\nOn March 9, 2017, a group of shareholders submitted a notice of the group\u2019s intention to nominate certain directors and submit certain proposals at the Company\u2019s 2017 annual meeting of shareholders. If the group does not withdraw its nominations and proposals or the Company is are unable to reach an agreement with the group relating to the 2017 annual meeting, a proxy contest is likely to occur. A proxy contest would require the Company\u2019 to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation and other expenses and require significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors. In addition, the potential of a proxy contest, or other activist shareholder activities, could interfere with the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business strategy, create uncertainties as to the Company\u2019s future direction, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified dentists, adversely affect the Company\u2019s relationships with dentists, other employees and patients and result in the loss of potential business opportunities, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operating results. In addition, under certain theoretical circumstances, if the shareholder group is successful in its proposals to change certain provisions of the Company\u2019s governing documents and having certain of its nominees approved, the shareholder group\u2019s nominees could constitute more than one-half of the Board. Such a change in the composition of the Board would result in a change of control under our equity incentive plan, which would result in the acceleration of our outstanding equity awards, and under certain contracts with third parties, including our Credit Facility, if the Company is unable to secure appropriate waivers or amendments to or approvals under any such contracts. A change of control as defined in the Credit Facility that is not approved by the bank constitutes an event of default under the Credit Facility. The Company\u2019s business and financial condition could be impaired and the market price of its common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by these events, risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company\u2019s operations place significant demands on management.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively depends upon its ability to hire, train, and assimilate additional management and other employees, and its ability to expand, improve and effectively utilize its operating, management, marketing and financial systems. Any failure by the Company to effectively anticipate, implement and manage the changes required to sustain the Company may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Expansion Program.\u201d\nThe success of the Company depends on the continued services of two members of the Company\u2019s senior management, its Chief Executive Officer, Fred Birner and its Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Dennis Genty. The Company believes its future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense and the Company competes for qualified personnel with numerous other employers, some of which have greater financial and other resources than the Company. The loss of the services of one or more members of the Company\u2019s senior management or the failure to add or retain qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends is restricted by its credit facility and several other factors.\nThe Company paid quarterly cash dividends from 2004 through the first quarter of 2016. During the remainder of 2016, dividends were prohibited under the Credit Facility and, as a result of the March 2017 amendment to the Credit Facility, dividends are not currently permitted under the Credit Facility. If permitted in the future, the payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and various factors may prevent the Company from paying dividends or may require the Company to reduce the dividends. Such factors include the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations, capital requirements and liquidity, the existence of a stock repurchase program, any loan agreement restrictions or other requirements of or actions by lenders, state corporate law restrictions, and other factors the Company\u2019s Board of Directors may consider relevant. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to pay dividends in the future.\nThe Company operates in a competitive market, which may reduce gross profit margins and market share.\nThe dental service organization segment of the dental services industry is highly competitive and is expected to become increasingly more competitive. Several dental service organizations operate in the Company\u2019s markets. A number of companies with dental service organization businesses similar to that of the Company currently operate in other parts of the country and may enter the Company\u2019s existing markets in the future. If the Company seeks to expand its operations into new markets, it is likely to face competition from other dental service organizations that already have established a strong business presence in such locations. The Company\u2019s competitors may have a more successful financial track record and greater resources, a better reputation of existing affiliated practices, more management expertise or otherwise enjoy competitive advantages, which may make it difficult for the Company to compete against them or to acquire additional Offices on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Competition.\u201d\nThe business of providing general dental and specialty dental services is highly competitive in the markets in which the Company operates. Competition for providing dental services may include practitioners who have more established practices and reputations. The Company competes against established practices in the retention and recruitment of general dentists, specialists, dental hygienists and other personnel. If the availability of such dentists, specialists, dental hygienists and other personnel declines in the Company\u2019s markets, it may become more difficult to attract qualified dentists, specialists, dental hygienists and other personnel. Competition has intensified in recent years, and the loss of dentists and other personnel and challenges presented in recruiting replacement personnel adversely affected the Company\u2019s results of operations in 2016. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to compete effectively against other existing practices or against new single or multi-specialty dental practices that enter its markets, or to compete against such practices in the recruitment and retention of qualified dentists, specialists, dental hygienists and other personnel. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Competition.\u201d\nThe Company is exposed to uncertainty and risks associated with de novo Office development.\nThe Company utilizes internal and external resources to identify locations in suitable markets for the development of de novo Offices. Identifying locations in suitable geographic markets and negotiating leases can be a lengthy and costly process. Furthermore, the Company will need to provide each de novo Office with the appropriate equipment, furnishings, materials and supplies and other capital resources. Additionally, de novo Offices must be staffed with one or more dentists. Because a de novo Office may be staffed with a dentist with no previous patient base, significant advertising and marketing expenditures may be required to attract patients. The Company\u2019s de novo Offices typically take a period of time after opening before they generate positive net income. The Company\u2019s two most recently opened de novo Offices, which opened during the third quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, had a net loss of $(737,000) for the year ended December 31, 2016. There can be no assurance that a de novo Office will become profitable. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Expansion Program.\u201d\nGeneral economic conditions and other factors outside of the Company\u2019s control may affect the Company\u2019s stock price and results of operations.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results of the Company or its competitors, developments in the industry or changes in general economic conditions. A recessionary economic cycle, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws or other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the Company\u2019s services and in particular, discretionary or elective dental services, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, worsening economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s collection of accounts receivable.\nThe Company\u2019s Offices are concentrated in Colorado.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s affiliated dental Offices are located in Colorado. The Offices in Colorado generated 68%, 68% and 66% of the Company\u2019s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Adverse changes or conditions affecting the Colorado market, such as health care reform, changes in laws and regulations, governmental investigations, competition and general economic conditions may have a particularly significant impact on the business of our affiliated dentists and our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s current concentration in the Colorado market as well as the Company\u2019s strategy of focused expansion in areas in and around the Company\u2019s existing markets increases the risk that adverse economic or regulatory developments in this market may have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company is not the owner of the P.C.s and is heavily dependent on its affiliated dentists and management agreements.\nThe Company receives management fees for services provided to the P.C.s under the Management Agreements. The Company owns most of the non-dental operating assets of the Offices but does not employ or contract with dentists, dental hygienists or dental assistants, or control the provision of dental care in the Offices, which exercise sole decision-making authority with respect to all clinical matters. The Company\u2019s revenue is dependent on the revenue generated by the P.C.s. Therefore, effective and continued performance of dentists providing services for the P.C.s is essential to the Company\u2019s long-term success. Under each Management Agreement, the Company pays substantially all of the operating and non-operating expenses associated with the provision of dental services except for the salaries and benefits of the dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants. Any material loss of revenue by the P.C.s would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results, and any termination of a Management Agreement (which is permitted in the event of a material default or bankruptcy by either party) could have such an effect. In the event of a breach of a Management Agreement by a P.C., there can be no assurance that the legal remedies available to the Company will be adequate to compensate the Company for its damages resulting from such breach. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Affiliation Model.\u201d Furthermore, state regulatory authorities may review the Management Agreements for legal and regulatory compliance. If a Management Agreement with a P.C. was deemed by a regulatory or judicial authority to be in violation of any law or regulation, the Company\u2019s relationship with the applicable Office may terminate, the shares in the P.C. may need to be transferred, the Management Agreement may require material amendments with uncertain consequences or the Company might be required to restructure its business model.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and other laws and regulations that could give rise to substantial liabilities or otherwise adversely affect its cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nThe practice of dentistry is regulated at both the state and federal levels. There can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which the Company or the P.C.s operate will not change significantly in the future. In addition, state and federal laws regulate health maintenance organizations and other managed care organizations for which dentists may be providers. In general, regulation of health care companies is increasing. In connection with its operations in existing markets and expansion into new markets, the Company may become subject to additional laws, regulations and interpretations or enforcement actions. The laws regulating health care are broad and subject to varying interpretations, and there is currently a lack of case law construing such statutes and regulations. The ability of the Company to operate profitably will depend in part upon the ability of the Company to operate in compliance with applicable health care regulations.\nThe laws of many states, including Colorado and New Mexico, permit a dentist to conduct a dental practice only as an individual, a member of a partnership or an employee of a professional corporation, limited liability company or limited liability partnership. These laws typically prohibit, either by specific provision or as a matter of general policy, non-dental entities, such as the Company, from practicing dentistry, from employing dentists and, in certain circumstances, dental hygienists or dental assistants, or from otherwise exercising control over the provision of dental services.\nMany states, including Colorado, limit the ability of a person other than a licensed dentist to own or control dental equipment or offices used in a dental practice. In addition, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and many other states impose limits on the tasks that may be delegated by dentists to dental hygienists and dental assistants. Some states, including Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico, regulate the content of advertisements of dental services. Some states require entities designated as \u201cclinics\u201d to be licensed, and may define clinics to include dental practices that are owned or controlled in whole or in part by non-dentists. These laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by the courts and by regulatory authorities with broad discretion.\nMany states, including Colorado and New Mexico, also prohibit \u201cfee-splitting\u201d by dentists with any party except other dentists in the same professional corporation or practice entity. In most cases, these laws have been construed as applying to the practice of paying a portion of a fee to another person for referring a patient or otherwise generating business, and not to prohibit payment of reasonable compensation for facilities and services (other than the generation of referrals), even if the payment is based on a percentage of the practice\u2019s revenues, but some courts have found that the percentage allocation of fees to a practice management company to be impermissible \u201cfee splitting.\u201d\nRegulatory uncertainties could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nMany states have fraud and abuse laws, which apply to referrals for items or services reimbursable by any third-party payor, not just by Medicare and Medicaid. A number of states, including Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico, prohibit the submitting of false claims for dental services.\nIn addition, there are certain regulatory risks associated with the Company\u2019s role in negotiating and administering managed care contracts. The application of state insurance laws to third-party payor arrangements, other than fee-for-service arrangements, is an unsettled area of law with little guidance available. Specifically, in some states, regulators may determine that the P.C.s are engaged in the business of insurance, particularly if they contract on a financial-risk basis directly with self-insured employers or other entities that are not licensed to engage in the business of insurance. If the P.C.s are determined to be engaged in the business of insurance, the Company may be required to change the method of payment from third-party payors and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nFederal laws generally regulate reimbursement and billing practices under Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal fraud and abuse statute prohibits, among other things, the payment, offer, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind to induce or in exchange for (i) the referral of a person for services reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid, or (ii) the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item, good, facility or service which is reimbursable under Medicare or Medicaid. In January 2016, the Company started the process of credentialing some of its Offices for Medicaid. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had 24 Offices credentialed for Medicaid in Colorado and 2 Offices credentialed for Medicaid in New Mexico. Revenue from Medicaid accounted for 1.1% of the Company\u2019s revenue in 2016. The Company expects revenue from Medicaid to increase in 2017. As a result, these laws and regulations impact the Company to a greater degree currently than in previous years.\nHealth care providers, including the Company, are required to comply with the electronic data security and privacy requirements of HIPAA. HIPAA delegates enforcement authority to the CMS Office for Civil Rights. Many HIPAA provisions apply directly to business associates of covered entities, and state attorneys general may pursue civil actions under HIPAA. Violations of HIPAA could result in civil penalties of up to $1,500,000 per type of violation in each calendar year and criminal penalties of up to $250,000 per violation and/or up to ten years in prison per violation. As of December 31, 2016, the Company believes that it was in material compliance with all requirements of HIPAA and there has been no material impact on the Company due to the implementation of these regulations.\nAlthough the Company believes that its operations as currently conducted are in compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s contractual arrangements will not be successfully challenged as violating applicable fraud and abuse, self-referral, false claims, fee-splitting, insurance, facility licensure or certificate-of-need laws or that the enforceability of such arrangements will not be limited as a result of such laws. In addition, there can be no assurance that the business structure under which the Company operates, or the advertising strategy the Company employs, will not be deemed to constitute the unlicensed practice of dentistry, or the operation of an unlicensed clinic or health care facility or a violation of a state dental practice act. The Company has not sought judicial or regulatory interpretations with respect to the manner in which it conducts its business. There can be no assurance that a review of the business of the Company and the P.C.s by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in a determination that could materially and adversely affect their operations or that the regulatory environment will not change so as to restrict the Company\u2019s existing or future operations. In the event that any legislative measures, regulatory provisions or rulings or judicial decisions restrict or prohibit the Company from carrying on its business or from expanding its operations to certain jurisdictions, structural and organizational modifications of the Company\u2019s organization and arrangements may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company, or the Company may be required to cease operations or change the way it conducts business. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d\nThe health care industry\u2019s cost-containment initiatives may reduce per patient profit margins.\nThe health care industry, including the dental services market, is experiencing a trend toward cost containment, as payors seek to impose lower reimbursement rates upon providers. The Company believes that this trend will continue and will increasingly affect the provision of dental services. This may result in a reduction in per-patient and per-procedure revenue from historical levels. Significant reductions in payments to dentists or other changes in reimbursement by payors for dental services may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf federal or state regulations change to require licensure, the Company\u2019s business model may be adversely affected.\nFederal and state laws regulate insurance companies and certain other managed care organizations. Many states, including Colorado, also regulate the establishment and operation of networks of health care providers. In most states, these laws do not apply to discounted-fee-for-service arrangements. These laws also do not generally apply to networks that are paid on a capitated basis, unless the entity with which the network provider is contracting is not a licensed health insurer or other managed care organization. There are exceptions to these rules in some states. For example, certain states require a license for a capitated arrangement with any party unless the risk-bearing entity is a professional corporation that employs the professionals. The Company believes its current activities do not constitute the provision of insurance in Arizona, Colorado or New Mexico, and thus, it is in compliance with the insurance laws of these states with respect to the operation of its Offices. There can be no assurance that these laws will not be changed or that interpretations of these laws by the regulatory authorities in those states, or in the states in which the Company expands, will not require licensure or a restructuring of some or all of the Company\u2019s operations. In the event that the Company is required to become licensed under these laws, the licensure process can be lengthy and time consuming and, unless the regulatory authority permits the Company to continue to operate while the licensure process is progressing, the Company could experience a material adverse change in its business while the licensure process is pending. In addition, many of the licensing requirements mandate strict financial and other requirements, which the Company may not immediately be able to meet. Further, once licensed, the Company would be subject to continuing oversight by and reporting to the respective regulatory agency. The regulatory framework of certain jurisdictions may limit the Company\u2019s expansion into, or ability to continue operations within, such jurisdictions if the Company is unable to modify its operational structure to conform to such regulatory framework. Any limitation on the Company\u2019s ability to expand could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company may see increased costs or lower revenue arising from the ACA or other health care reforms.\nThe ACA and its implementing regulations are far-reaching and significantly change the health care industry. Federal and state agencies are expected to continue to implement provisions of the ACA. There are both potentially positive and negative impacts of the ACA on the business of the Company. The Company continues to evaluate the net impact of the ACA on its business but thus far has not seen any direct material impact. Given the complexity and the number of changes expected as a result of the ACA, as well as the implementation timetable and delays for many of them, the ultimate impact of the ACA on the Company is uncertain. In addition, with the change in the Presidential administration, legislation has been introduced to repeal and/or replace the ACA. Even if the ACA is not amended, repealed or replaced, the new administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the ACA. The Company is unable to predict the impact from any future changes to the ACA or its implementation. The ACA or other health care reform measures could have a material adverse effect on the Company through the imposition of increased costs or reduced revenue, including by reduction of Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates to the extent such programs become a material part of the Company\u2019s business in the future. Federal and state governments may propose other health care initiatives and revisions to the health care and health insurance systems. It is uncertain what legislative programs, if any will be adopted in the future, or what action Congress or state legislatures may take regarding other health care reform proposals or legislation. In addition, changes in the health care industry, such as the growth of accountable care organizations, managed care organizations and provider networks, may result in lower payments for the services of the Company\u2019s managed practices.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from capitated payment arrangements, which have terms that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2016, the Company derived approximately 7.4% of its revenue from capitated managed dental care contracts, and 8.6% of its revenue from associated co-payments. Under a capitated managed dental care contract, the dental practice provides dental services to the members of the plan and receives a fixed monthly capitation payment for each plan member covered for a specific schedule of services regardless of the quantity or cost of services to the participating dental practice which is obligated to provide them, and may receive a co-pay for each service provided. This arrangement shifts the risk of utilization of such services to the dental group that provides the dental services. Because the Company assumes responsibility under its Management Agreements for all aspects of the operation of the dental practices other than the practice of dentistry and thus bears all costs of the provision of dental services at the Offices other than compensation and benefits of dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants, the risk of over-utilization of dental services at the Offices under capitated managed dental care plans is effectively shifted to the Company. In contrast, under traditional indemnity insurance arrangements, the insurance company reimburses reasonable charges that are billed for the dental services provided.\nRisks associated with capitated managed dental care contracts include principally (i) the risk that the capitation payments and any associated co-payments do not adequately cover the costs of providing the dental services, (ii) the risk that one or more of the P.C.s may be terminated as an approved provider by managed dental care plans with which they contract, (iii) the risk that the Company will be unable to negotiate future capitation arrangements on satisfactory terms with managed care dental plans, and (iv) the risk that large subscriber groups will terminate their relationship with such managed dental care plans, which would reduce patient volume and capitation and co-payment revenue. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to negotiate future capitation arrangements on behalf of P.C.s on satisfactory terms or at all, or that the fees offered in current capitation arrangements will not be reduced to levels unsatisfactory to the Company. Moreover, to the extent that costs incurred by the Company\u2019s affiliated dental practices in providing services to patients covered by capitated managed dental care contracts exceed the revenue under such contracts, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Payor Mix.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s failure to effectively evaluate and integrate acquisitions may have negative effects on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has completed 45 dental practice acquisitions, eight of which have been consolidated into existing Offices and one practice that was closed during 2004. The success of future acquisitions will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nAbility to Identify Suitable Dental Practices. Identifying appropriate acquisition candidates and negotiating and consummating acquisitions can be a lengthy and costly process. Furthermore, the Company may compete for acquisition opportunities with companies that have greater resources than the Company. There can be no assurance that suitable acquisition candidates will be identified or that acquisitions will be consummated on terms favorable to the Company, on a timely basis or at all. If a planned acquisition fails to occur or is delayed, the Company\u2019s financial results may be materially lower than expectations, resulting in a decline, perhaps substantial, in the market price of its Common Stock. In addition, increasing consolidation in the dental management services industry may result in an increase in purchase prices required to be paid by the Company to acquire dental practices.\n\u00b7\nAbility to Integrate Dental Practices. The integration of acquired dental practices into the Company is a difficult, costly and time consuming process that, among other things, requires the Company to attract and retain competent and experienced management and administrative personnel and to implement and integrate reporting and tracking systems, management information systems and other operating systems. In addition, such integration may require the expansion of accounting controls and procedures and the evaluation of certain personnel functions. There can be no assurance that substantial unanticipated problems, costs or delays associated with such integration efforts or with such acquired practices will not occur. There also can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully integrate acquired practices in a timely manner or at all, or that any acquired practices will have a positive impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe substantial value of its intangible assets may impair the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2016, intangible assets on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet were approximately $6.7 million, representing 36.0% of the Company\u2019s total assets at that date. If the Company completes additional acquisitions, the Company expects the amount allocable to intangible assets on its consolidated balance sheets will increase, which will increase the Company\u2019s amortization expense. In the event of any sale or liquidation of the Company or a portion of its assets, the value of the Company\u2019s intangible assets may not be realized. In addition, the Company evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred indicating that any portion of the remaining balance of the amount allocable to the Company\u2019s intangible assets may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that the amount allocable to the Company\u2019s intangible assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company may be required to reduce the carrying value of such assets. Any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nProfessional liability may produce unforeseen expenses and lower operating results.\nIn recent years, dentists have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging malpractice. Some of these lawsuits involve large claims and significant defense costs. Any suits involving the Company or dentists at the Offices, if successful, could result in substantial damage awards that may exceed the limits of the Company\u2019s insurance coverage. The Company provides business services; it does not engage in the practice of dentistry or control the practice of dentistry by the dentists or their compliance with regulatory requirements directly applicable to providers. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will not become subject to litigation in the future as a result of the dental services provided at the Offices. The Company maintains professional liability insurance for itself and provides for professional liability insurance covering dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants at the Offices. While the Company believes it has adequate liability insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that the coverage will be adequate to cover losses or that coverage will continue to be available upon terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, certain types of risks and liabilities, including penalties and fines imposed by governmental agencies, are not covered by insurance. Malpractice insurance, moreover, can be expensive and varies from state to state. Successful malpractice claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Insurance.\u201d\nNon-competition covenants and other arrangements with the Company\u2019s affiliated dentists may not be enforceable.\nThe Management Agreements require the P.C.s to enter into employment agreements with dentists which include non-competition provisions typically for three years after termination of employment within a specified geographic area, usually a specified number of miles from the relevant Office, and restrict solicitation of employees and patients. Covenants not to compete are generally not favored by courts. In Colorado, covenants not to compete are prohibited by statute with certain exceptions. Permitted covenants not to compete are enforceable in Colorado only to the extent their terms are reasonable in both duration and geographic scope and meet other statutory and common law requirements. In 2015, New Mexico adopted a new statute that limits the enforcement of non-competition provisions against health care practitioners, but allows the recovery of relocation expenses and signing bonuses, authorizes the enforcement of non-solicitation provisions and allows the recovery of reasonable liquidated damages. Arizona courts have enforced covenants not to compete if their terms are found to be reasonable and meet other statutory and common law requirements. It is thus uncertain whether a court will enforce a covenant not to compete in the states in which the Company operates in a given situation. In addition, there is little judicial authority regarding whether a dental service organization agreement will be viewed as the type of protectable business interest that would permit it to enforce such a covenant or to require a P.C. to enforce such covenants against dentists formerly employed by the P.C. Since the intangible value of a Management Agreement depends primarily on the ability of the P.C. to preserve its business, which could be harmed if employed dentists went into competition with the P.C., a determination that the covenants not to compete contained in the employment agreements between the P.C. and its employed dentists are unenforceable could have a material adverse impact on the Company. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Affiliation Model- Employment Agreements.\u201d In addition, the Company is a party to various agreements with managing dentists who own the P.C.s, which restrict the dentists\u2019 ability to transfer the shares in the P.C.s. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Affiliation Model - Relationship with Professional Corporations.\u201d There can be no assurance that these agreements will be enforceable in a given situation. A determination that these agreements are not enforceable could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nSeasonality could affect revenue during the latter part of the fiscal year.\nThe Company\u2019s past financial results have fluctuated somewhat due to seasonal variations in the dental service industry, with revenue typically lower in the fourth calendar quarter. The Company expects this seasonal fluctuation to continue in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s inability or failure to protect its intellectual property could have a negative impact on its operating results.\nThe Company owns one trademark registration (PERFECT TEETH\u2122) that it currently uses and considers to be material to the successful operation of its business. If the Company is unable to protect or preserve the value of this trademark, or other proprietary rights for any reason, its brand and reputation could be impaired or diluted and the Company may see a decline in revenues.\nEvents or rumors relating to the Company\u2019s brand names could significantly impact its business.\nRecognition of the Company\u2019s PERFECT TEETH\u2122 brand name and the association of the brand with quality, comprehensive dental care is an integral part of its business. Any events or rumors that cause patients to no longer associate the brand with quality, comprehensive dental care may materially adversely affect the value of the brand name and demand for dental services at the Offices.\nInterruptions in the Company\u2019s information systems could limit its ability to operate its business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent on information systems for operational processes, financial information and insurance billing operations. The Company\u2019s information systems could be vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, cyber attacks, human error, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events. A significant or prolonged interruption to the Company\u2019s information systems could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces risks related to unauthorized disclosure of confidential patient information.\nThe Company routinely has access to confidential health and financial information of patients in connection with the operation of its business. The Company has installed privacy protection systems on its network in an attempt to prevent unauthorized access to information in its database. However, the Company\u2019s technology may fail to adequately secure the confidential health and financial information and personally identifiable information of patients that the Company maintains in its databases. In such circumstances, the Company may be held liable to patients and regulators, which could result in fines, litigation or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if the Company is not held liable, any resulting negative publicity could harm its business and distract the attention of management.\nIf the Company fails to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls, the Company\u2019s ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would adversely affect its operating results, financial condition and stock price.\nEnsuring that the Company has adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Failure by the Company to maintain effective internal financial and accounting controls would cause its financial reporting to be unreliable, could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows, and could cause the trading price of its Common Stock to fall dramatically.\nThe OTCQX Market has certain financial, reporting and corporate governance standards, and failure to comply with the standards may result in the Company\u2019s Common Stock being removed from the OTCQX Market.\nThe Company\u2019s Common Stock is thinly-held and trades with low volume. If the Company is unable to maintain the financial, reporting and corporate governance standards of the OTCQX Market, the Company may be removed from the OTCQX Market. If the Company\u2019s stock is removed from the OTCQX Market, the price of the Common Stock may decrease, liquidity of the Common Stock could be further reduced, and the Company\u2019s ability to secure additional financing through the issuance and sale of equity could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 85804, "SIC": 8000, "TIC": "BDMS"}
