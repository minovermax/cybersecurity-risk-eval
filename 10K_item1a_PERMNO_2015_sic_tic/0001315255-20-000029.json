{"cik": "1315255", "company": "GTT Communications, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. Below are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or telecommunications and/or technology companies in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur business could suffer delays and problems due to the actions of network providers on whom we are partially dependent.\nMost of our clients are connected to our network by means of communications lines that are provided as services by local telephone companies and others. We may experience problems with the installation, maintenance, and pricing of these lines and other communications links, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our plans to add additional clients to our network using such services. We attempt to mitigate this risk by using many different providers so that we have alternatives for linking a client to our network. Competition among the providers tends to improve installation intervals, maintenance, and pricing.\nOur network may be the target of potential cyber-attacks and other security breaches that could have significant negative consequences.\nOur business depends on our ability to limit and mitigate interruptions or degradation to our network availability. Our network, including our routers, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, DDoS, and other security breaches. Cyber-attacks have increased in frequency, scope, and potential harm in recent years. An attack on or security breach of our network could result in interruption or cessation of services, our inability to meet our service level commitments, and potentially compromise client data transmitted over our network. If cyber-thieves gain improper access to our network, they may be able to access, steal, publish, delete, misappropriate, or modify confidential client data, and additional harm to clients could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to such confidential client data. We cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented, thereby resulting in compromised client data or network failures or interruptions that could impact our network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operational results. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against such threats, and may experience litigation, a reduction in revenues, and a diminution in goodwill, caused by a breach. Although our client contracts limit our liability, affected clients and third parties may seek to recover damages from us under various legal theories.\nWe are required to maintain, repair, upgrade, and replace our network and facilities and our network could suffer serious disruption if certain locations experience serious damage.\nOur business requires that we maintain, upgrade, repair, and periodically replace parts of our network facilities. This requires, and will continue to require, management time and the expenditure of capital on a regular basis. In the event that we fail to maintain, upgrade, or replace essential portions of our network facilities, it could lead to a material degradation in the level of service that we provide, which would adversely affect our business.\nThere are certain locations through which a large amount of our Internet traffic passes. Examples are facilities in which we exchange traffic with other carriers, the facilities through which our subsea cable traffic passes, and certain of our network hub sites. If any of these facilities were destroyed or seriously damaged, a significant amount of our network traffic could be disrupted. Because of the large volume of traffic passing through these facilities, our ability (and the ability of carriers with whom we exchange traffic) to quickly restore service would be challenged. Our subsea cables may require repairs for damage caused by natural disasters, fishing vessels, or intentional damage by activist groups. These repairs may take significant time and our ability to re-route traffic to other cable systems or procure services on competitors' subsea cables may affect our ability to service these clients.\nIn the event of such damage to any of our owned infrastructure, we will be required to incur expenses to repair such damage. There could be parts of our network or the networks of other carriers that could not be quickly restored or that would experience substantially reduced service for a significant time. If such a disruption occurs, we may lose clients or have difficulty attracting new clients, resulting in an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and cash flows.\nWe may have difficulty and experience disruptions as we add features and upgrade our network.\nWe are constantly upgrading our network and implementing new features and services. This process involves reconfiguring our network and making changes to our operating systems. In doing so we may experience disruptions that affect our clients, our revenue, and our ability to grow. We may require additional resources to accomplish this work in a timely manner. That could cause us to incur unexpected expenses or delay portions of this effort to the detriment of our ability to provide service to our clients.\nWe may make purchase commitments to vendors for longer terms or in excess of the volumes committed by our underlying clients, or we may occasionally have certain sales commitments to clients that extend beyond our commitments from our underlying suppliers.\nWe attempt to match our purchase of network capacity from our suppliers and service commitments from our clients. However, from time to time, we may contract for obligations to our suppliers that exceed the duration of the related client contracts or that are for capacity in excess of the amount for which we have client commitments. This could arise:\n\u2022\nbased upon the terms and conditions available from our suppliers;\n\u2022\nfrom an expectation that we will be able to utilize the excess capacity;\n\u2022\nas a result of a breach of a client\u2019s commitment to us; and\n\u2022\nto support fixed elements of our network.\nUnder any of these circumstances, we may incur the cost of the network capacity from our supplier without having corresponding revenue from clients, which could result in a material and adverse impact on our operating results.\nConversely, from time to time, our client may contract for services that extend beyond the duration of the underlying vendor commitment. This may cause us to seek a renewal of services for a shorter period than we typically seek, or a shortened service period at higher prices. Our financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to purchase extended service from a supplier at a cost sufficiently low to maintain margins for the remaining term of our commitment to a client. While we have not historically encountered material price increases from suppliers with respect to continuation or renewal of services after expiration of initial contract terms, we cannot be certain that we would be able to obtain similar terms and conditions from suppliers going forward.\nOur connections to the Internet require us to establish and maintain peering relationships with other providers, which we may not be able to maintain.\nThe Internet is composed of various network providers who operate their own networks that interconnect at public and private interconnection points. Our network is one such network. In order to obtain Internet connectivity for our network, we must establish and maintain relationships with other providers, including many providers that are clients, and incur the necessary capital costs to locate our equipment and connect our network at these various interconnection points.\nBy entering into what are known as settlement-free peering arrangements, providers agree to exchange traffic between their respective networks without charging each other. Our ability to avoid the higher costs of acquiring paid dedicated network capacity (transit\nor paid peering) and to maintain high network performance is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain peering relationships and to increase the capacity of these peering connections. The terms and conditions of our peering relationships may also be subject to adverse changes, which we may not be able to control. If we are not able to maintain or increase our peering relationships in all of our markets on favorable terms, we may not be able to provide our clients with high performance or affordable or reliable services, which could cause us to lose existing and potential clients, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur core network infrastructure equipment is provided by a concentrated number of vendors.\nWe purchase the majority of the routers and transmission equipment used in our core IP network from a concentrated number of vendors. If these vendors fail to provide equipment on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, including in the event that these vendors fail to enhance, maintain, upgrade, or improve their products, hardware, or software we purchase from them when and how we need, we may be delayed or unable to provide services as and when requested by our clients. Any disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies, and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThese vendors may also be subject to litigation with respect to the technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can result in the diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to obtain non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements for the technology on which we depend. There can be no assurance that such non-infringing technology or licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all.\nIf the information systems that we depend on to support our clients, network operations, sales, billing, and financial reporting do not perform as expected, our operations and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on complex information systems to operate our network and support our other business functions. Our ability to track sales leads, close sales opportunities, provision services, bill our clients for our services, and prepare our financial statements depends upon the effective integration of our various information systems. If our information systems, individually or collectively, fail or do not perform as expected, our ability to process and provision orders, to make timely payments to vendors, to ensure that we collect amounts owed to us, and to prepare our financial statements would be adversely affected. Such failures or delays could result in increased capital expenditures, client and vendor dissatisfaction, loss of business or the inability to add new clients or additional services, and the inability to prepare accurate and timely financial statements, all of which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business depends on agreements with carrier neutral data center operators, which we could fail to obtain or maintain.\nOur business depends upon access to clients in carrier neutral data centers, which are facilities in which many large users of the Internet house the computer servers that deliver content and applications to users by means of the Internet and provide access to multiple Internet access networks. Most carrier neutral data centers allow any carrier to operate within the facility (for a standard fee). We expect to enter into additional agreements with carrier neutral data center operators as part of our growth plan. Current government regulations do not require carrier neutral data center operators to allow all carriers access on terms that are reasonable or nondiscriminatory. We have been successful in obtaining agreements with these operators in the past and have generally found that the operators want to have us located in their facilities because we offer low-cost, high-capacity Internet service to their clients. Any deterioration in our existing relationships with these operators could harm our sales and marketing efforts and could substantially reduce our potential client base.\nWe may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our network.\nAlthough we believe our liability for third-party information stored on or transmitted through our networks is limited, the liability of private network operators is impacted both by changing technology and evolving legal principles. As a private network provider, we could be exposed to legal claims relating to third-party content stored or transmitted on our networks. Such claims could involve, among others, allegations of defamation, invasion of privacy, copyright infringement, or aiding and abetting restricted activities such as online gambling or pornography. If we decide to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to these risks or if we are required to defend ourselves against these kinds of claims, our operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected.\nHistorically, we have generated net losses and used more cash than we have generated from operations, and we may continue to do so.\nWe have historically generated net losses and such losses may continue in the future. These net losses primarily have been driven by acquisition-related expenses, depreciation, amortization, interest expense, and share-based compensation. We cannot assure you that we will generate net income in the future.\nWe have also consistently consumed our entire positive cash flow generated from operating activities with our investing activities. Our investing activities have consisted principally of the acquisition of businesses and client contracts as well as additions to property and equipment. We have funded the excess of cash used in investing activities over cash provided by operating activities with proceeds from equity and debt issuances.\nWe intend to continue to invest in expanding our business and pursuing acquisitions that we believe provide an attractive return on our capital. These investments may continue to exceed the amount of cash flow available from operations after debt service requirements. To the extent that our investments exceed our cash flow from operations, we plan to rely on potential future debt or equity issuances, which could increase interest expense or dilute the interest of stockholders, as well as cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain or continue to have access to sufficient capital on reasonable terms, or at all, to successfully grow our business.\nOur revenue is relatively concentrated among a small number of clients, and the loss of any of these clients could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRevenues from our top five clients accounted for less than 10% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. We currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of clients for a significant percentage of our revenue. Many of these clients are also competitors for some or all of our service offerings. Our client contracts typically have terms of one to three years. Our clients may elect not to renew these contracts. Furthermore, our client contracts are terminable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract. We may face increased competition and pricing pressure as our client contracts become subject to renewal. Our clients may negotiate renewal of their contracts at lower rates, for fewer services, or for shorter terms. Many of our clients are in the telecommunications industry, which is undergoing consolidation. To the extent that two or more of our clients combine, they may be able to use their greater size to negotiate lower prices from us and may purchase fewer services from us, especially if their networks overlap. If we are unable to successfully renew our client contracts on commercially acceptable terms, or if our client contracts are terminated, our business could suffer.\nWe are also subject to credit risk associated with the concentration of our accounts receivable from our key clients. If one or more of these clients were to become bankrupt, insolvent, or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us, we may incur significant write-offs of accounts receivable or incur impairment charges.\nFuture acquisitions are a component of our strategic plan, and will include integration and other risks that could harm our business.\nAlthough we currently have no plans to make significant acquisitions, we may acquire complementary businesses and assets in the future. This exposes us to the risk that when we evaluate a potential acquisition target we over-estimate the target\u2019s value and, as a result, pay too much for it. Difficulties with integration could cause material client disruption and dissatisfaction, which could in turn increase churn and reduce new sales. Additionally, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses in a manner that permits us to realize the cost synergies we anticipate, and any future acquisitions may cause disruption of our ongoing business and divert management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations. Our actual cost synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities, and efficiency and operational benefits resulting from any acquisition may be lower and may take longer to realize than we currently expect.\nWe are growing rapidly and may not maintain or efficiently manage our growth.\nWe have rapidly grown our company through acquisitions of companies and assets and the acquisition of new clients through our own sales efforts. In order to become consistently profitable and consistently cash flow positive, we need to both retain existing clients and continue to add a large number of new clients. Clients can be reluctant to switch providers of bandwidth services because it can involve substantial expense and technical difficulty. That can make it harder for us to add new clients through our own sales efforts. Our expansion may place strains on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth will be particularly dependent upon our ability to:\n\u2022\nexpand, develop, and retain an effective sales force and other qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nmaintain the quality of our operations and our service offerings;\n\u2022\nattract clients to switch from their current providers to us in spite of the costs associated with switching providers;\n\u2022\nmaintain and enhance our system of internal controls to ensure timely and accurate reporting; and\n\u2022\nexpand our operational information systems in order to support our growth, including integrating new clients without disruption.\nWe expect that economies of scale will allow us to increase revenue while incurring incremental costs that are proportionately lower than those applicable to our existing businesses. If the increased costs required to support our revenue growth turn out to be greater than anticipated, we may be unable to improve our profitability and/or cash flows even if our revenue growth goals are achieved.\nWe are highly dependent on our management team and other key employees.\nWe expect that our continued success will largely depend upon the efforts and abilities of members of our management team and other key employees. Our success also depends upon our ability to identify, attract, develop, and retain qualified employees. If we lose members of our management team or other key employees, or if we are unable to recruit qualified employees in the future, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and our cash flows.\nThe international operations of our business expose us to risks that could materially and adversely affect the business.\nWe have operations and investments outside of the United States, as well as rights to subsea cable capacity extending to other countries, that expose us to risks inherent in international operations. These include:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, social, and political conditions;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\ntax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those in the US;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rates may fluctuate, which could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our international assets and investments;\n\u2022\nforeign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls, or other restrictions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of compliance with foreign laws and regulations that impose restrictions on our investments and operations, with penalties for noncompliance, including loss of licenses and monetary fines;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining licenses or interconnection arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all; and\n\u2022\nchanges in US laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment.\nIn addition, on June 23, 2016, the citizens of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). In March 2017, the British government formally triggered a negotiation process to leave the European Union. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom officially withdrew from the European Union, beginning a transition period during which the British government will negotiate agreements with the European Union and other governments regarding various matters, including trade and immigration. The consequences for the economies of the European Union and the United Kingdom are unknown and unpredictable, and could lead to economic and legal uncertainty, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and increasingly divergent laws, regulations and licensing requirements applicable to us as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. Our operations in the United Kingdom and Europe, as well as our North American operations, could be impacted by the global economic uncertainty caused by Brexit. If we are unable to manage any of these risks effectively, our business could be adversely affected.\nSome of our client agreements contain service level obligations that could subject us to liability or the loss of revenue.\nSome of our contracts with clients contain service level guarantees (including network availability) and service delivery date targets, which, if not met, enable clients to claim credits and, under certain conditions, terminate their agreements. Our failure to meet our service level guarantees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Lost revenue from failure to meet service level guarantees was de minimis for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019. While we typically have carve-outs for force majeure events, many events, such as fiber cuts, equipment failure, and third-party vendors being unable to meet their underlying commitments with us, could impact our ability to meet our service level agreements, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nOur international operations expose us to currency risk.\nWe conduct a portion of our business using foreign currencies, predominately the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. Fluctuation of the US Dollar could adversely affect our consolidated revenue. Since we tend to incur costs in the same currency in which those operations realize revenue, the effect on operating income and operating cash flow is largely mitigated. However, a large portion of our financing cash flow is denominated in US Dollars, and if the US Dollar fluctuates significantly, future revenues, operating income, and operating cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur future tax liabilities are not predictable or controllable. If we become subject to increased levels of taxation, our financial condition and operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe provide telecommunication and other services in multiple jurisdictions primarily across the United States and Europe and are, therefore, subject to multiple sets of complex and varying tax laws and rules. We cannot predict the amount of future tax liabilities to which we may become subject. Any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of our operations or due to legislative or regulatory changes would be adverse to us. In addition, we may become subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. It is possible that certain tax positions taken by us could result in tax liabilities for us. While we believe that our current provisions for taxes are reasonable and appropriate, we cannot assure you that these items would be settled for the amounts accrued or that we will not identify additional exposures in the future.\nWe cannot assure you whether, when, or in what amounts we will be able to use our net operating losses, or when they will be depleted.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $212.6 million of US federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) net of limitations under Section 382 and $873.1 million of foreign NOLs. Under certain circumstances, these NOLs can be used to offset our future federal and certain state taxable income.\nIf we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and related Treasury regulations, our ability to use the NOLs could be substantially limited. This limit could impact the timing of the usage of the NOLs, thus accelerating cash tax payments or causing NOLs to expire prior to their use, which could affect the ultimate realization of the NOLs. Furthermore, transactions that we enter into, as well as transactions by existing or future 5% stockholders that we do not participate in, could cause us to incur an \u201cownership change,\u201d which could prevent us from fully utilizing our NOLs to reduce our federal income taxes. These limitations could cause us not to pursue otherwise favorable acquisitions and other transactions involving our capital stock, or could reduce the net benefits to be realized from any such transactions.\nIn 2019, our Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan to protect our NOLs during the effective period of the rights plan. The rights plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d that could adversely affect us by imposing substantial ownership dilution on any stockholder who acquires 5% or more of our common stock. However, there is no assurance that the rights plan will prevent all transfers that could result in such an \u201cownership change.\" In addition, the rights plan could adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging potential investors who may be interested in acquiring our Company or a large block of our common stock, and the restriction on large new stockholders in the Company could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our stockholders.\nWe issue projected results and estimates for future periods from time to time, and such projections and estimates are subject to inherent uncertainties and may prove to be inaccurate.\nFinancial information, results of operations, and other projections that we may issue from time to time are based upon our assumptions and estimates. While we believe these assumptions and estimates to be reasonable when they are developed, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. You should understand that certain unpredictable factors could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations and those differences may be material. No independent expert participates in the preparation of these estimates. These estimates should not be regarded as a representation by us as to our results of operations during such periods as there can be no assurance that any of these estimates will be realized. In light of the foregoing, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these estimates. These estimates constitute forward-looking statements.\nIf we do not comply with laws regarding corruption and bribery, we may become subject to monetary or criminal penalties.\nThe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. We are subject to similar laws in other countries. We currently take precautions to comply with these laws. However, these precautions may not protect us against liability, particularly as a result of actions that may be taken in the future by agents and other intermediaries through whom we have exposure under these laws even though we may have limited or no ability to control such persons. Our competitors include foreign entities that are not subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or laws of similar stringency, and hence we may be at a competitive disadvantage.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nConsolidation among companies in the telecommunications industry could further strengthen our competitors and adversely impact our business.\nThe telecommunications industry is very competitive and continues to undergo significant consolidation. There are many reasons for consolidation in our industry, including the desire for companies to acquire clients or assets in regions where they currently have no or insufficient presence. The consolidation within the industry may cause clients to disconnect services, to move them to their own networks, or to consolidate buying with other providers. Additionally, consolidation in the industry could further strengthen our competitors, give them greater financial resources and geographic reach, and allow them to put additional pressure on prices for our services. Furthermore, consolidation can reduce the number of suppliers available to contract with, resulting in decreased flexibility and cost savings opportunity.\nThe sector in which we operate is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe face significant competition from incumbent carriers, Internet service providers, and facilities-based network operators. Relative to us, many of these providers have significantly greater financial, technological, and personnel resources, more well-established brand names, superior marketing capabilities, greater network reach, larger client bases, and more diverse strategic plans and service offerings. Most of these competitors are also our clients and suppliers. Intense competition from these traditional and new communications companies has led to declining prices and margins for many communications services, and we expect this trend to continue as competition intensifies in the future. Our competitors may also introduce new technologies or services that could make our services less attractive to potential clients. Our total addressable market is flat to declining largely driven by SD-WAN and other cheaper networking infrastructure.\nCertain of our services are subject to regulation that could change or otherwise impact us in an adverse manner.\nCommunications services are subject to domestic and international regulation at the federal, state, and local levels. These regulations affect our business and our existing and potential competitors. In the United States, both the FCC and the state PUCs or similar regulatory authorities typically require us to file periodic reports, pay various regulatory fees and assessments, and to comply with their regulations. Such compliance can be costly and burdensome and may affect the way we conduct our business. Delays in receiving required regulatory approvals (including approvals relating to acquisitions or financing activities or for interconnection agreements with other carriers), the enactment of new and adverse international or domestic legislation or regulations (including those pertaining to broadband initiatives and net-neutrality), or the denial, modification, or termination by a regulator of any approval or authorization, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur communications services and communications networks in Europe and elsewhere are also subject to regulatory oversight by national communications regulators, such as the United Kingdom\u2019s Office of Communications (\u201cOfcom\u201d). In addition, in April 2016, the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018. GDPR extends the scope of European privacy laws to any entity which processes personal data about European Union residents in connection with the offer of goods or services or the monitoring of behavior. GDPR imposes numerous new requirements for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, including: more stringent requirements relating to data subject consent; what information must be shared with data subjects regarding how their personal information is used; the obligation to notify regulators and affected individuals of personal data breaches; extensive new internal privacy governance obligations; and obligations to honor expanded rights of individuals in relation to their personal information (e.g., the right to access, correct and delete their data). Complying with GDPR and other emerging and changing privacy requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. Noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability, and could affect our ability to retain and attract clients.\nLocal governments also exercise legal authority that may have an adverse effect on our business because of our need to obtain rights-of-way for certain portions of our network. While local governments may not prohibit persons from providing telecommunications services nor treat telecommunications service providers in a discriminatory manner, they can affect the timing and costs associated with our use of public rights-of-way. Further, the current regulatory landscape is subject to change through judicial review of current legislation and rulemaking by the FCC, Ofcom, and other domestic, foreign, and international rulemaking bodies. These rulemaking bodies regularly consider changes to their regulatory framework and fee obligations. Changes in current regulation may make it more difficult to obtain the approvals necessary to operate our business, significantly increase the regulatory fees to which we are subject, or have other adverse effects on our future operations in the United States and Europe.\nWe are subject to various forms of regulation from the Federal Communications Commission and state regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate, which limit our pricing flexibility and cost structure for regulated voice and high-speed Internet products.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had operating authority from each of the 48 states and the District of Columbia in which we conducted operations, and we are subject to various forms of regulation from the regulatory commissions in each of these areas as well as from the FCC. The FCC has primary jurisdiction over interstate services including the rates that we pay other telecommunications companies to use their network and other issues related to interstate service. Future revenues, costs, and capital investment in our acquired businesses could be adversely affected by material changes to or decisions regarding applicability of government requirements. Federal and state communications laws and regulations may be amended in the future, and other laws and regulations may affect our business. In addition, certain laws and regulations applicable to us and our competitors may be, and have been, challenged in the courts and could be changed at any time. We cannot predict future developments or changes to the regulatory environment or the impact such developments or changes would have. In addition, these regulations could create significant compliance costs for us.\nOur growth and financial health are subject to a number of economic risks.\nA downturn in the world economy, especially the economies of North America and Europe, would negatively impact our growth. We would be particularly impacted by a decline in the development of new applications and businesses that make use of the Internet, which depend on numerous factors beyond our control. Our revenue growth is predicated on growing use of the Internet that makes up for the declining prices of Internet service. An economic downturn could impact the Internet business more significantly than other businesses that are less dependent on new applications and growth in the use of those applications because of the retrenchment by consumers and businesses that typically occur in an economic downturn.\nUnfavorable general global economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nUnfavorable general global economic conditions could negatively affect our business. Although it is difficult to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the affordability of, and client demand for, our services, and could cause clients to delay or forgo purchases of our services. One or more of these circumstances could cause our revenue to decline. Also, our clients may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to purchase our services or make timely payments to us. The current economic conditions, including federal fiscal and monetary policy actions, may lead to inflationary conditions in our cost base, particularly in our lease and personnel related expenses. This could harm our margins and profitability if we are unable to increase prices or reduce costs sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation in our cost base. For these reasons, among others, if challenging economic conditions persist or worsen, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nTerrorist activity throughout the world, military action to counter terrorism, or natural disasters could adversely impact our business.\nThe continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on business, financial, and general economic conditions internationally. Effects from these events and any future terrorist activity, including cyber terrorism, may, in turn, increase our costs due to the need to provide enhanced security, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. These circumstances may also damage or destroy our Internet infrastructure and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain clients, our ability to raise capital and the operation and maintenance of our network access points. We are also susceptible to other catastrophic events such as major natural disasters, extreme weather, fire, or similar events that could affect our headquarters, other offices, our network, infrastructure or equipment, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt agreements.\nWe have substantial indebtedness. Our substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to our debt;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which will reduce funds available for other business purposes, including the growth of our operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared with some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures, for strategic acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes.\nOur ability to satisfy our obligations, including our debt, depends upon our future operating performance and upon economic, financial, competitive, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow, and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds, to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy.\nDespite our leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The terms of our debt facilities restrict, but do not completely prohibit, us from doing so. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nWe may be subject to interest rate risk, and increasing interest rates may increase our interest expense.\nBorrowings under the credit agreement bear, and our future indebtedness may bear, interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. To mitigate the risk of rising interest rates, we may use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variable rate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements, without exchange of the underlying principal amounts. We may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively, which could adversely affect our business, earnings and financial condition. Additionally, if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large US financial institutions, announced replacement of US dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by US Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). We are not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be published or precisely how SOFR will be calculated and published. Any changes adopted by FCA or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR. If that were to occur, our interest payments could change. In addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in its current form. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our loan documents that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established.\nThe agreements governing our debt obligations impose restrictions on our business and could adversely affect our ability to undertake certain corporate actions.\nThe agreements governing our various debt obligations include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ngrant guarantees of indebtedness;\n\u2022\nconsummate acquisitions;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, mergers and acquisitions, or other corporate opportunities.\nIn addition, the credit agreement requires us to comply with specified financial ratios, including ratios regarding secured leverage. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. These restrictions limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs, or otherwise constrain our activities or business plans. They also may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions, or engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nA breach of any of the covenants contained in our debt obligations, including our credit agreement, the indenture governing our notes or any future agreements related to indebtedness, or our inability to comply with the financial ratios in our credit agreement could result in an event of default, which would allow our lenders, noteholders or the trustee under the indenture to declare all borrowings or notes, as applicable, outstanding to be due and payable.\nIn addition, an event of default under our credit agreement would also allow our lenders to terminate the ability to borrow under our revolving line of credit facility (\"Revolver\"). If the amounts outstanding under our debt obligations or other future indebtedness were to be accelerated, we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed. In such a situation, we could be forced to file for bankruptcy or seek other protections from creditors.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. However, our ability to generate cash depends upon many factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future, which, in turn, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and we may not have available to us future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In these circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Without this financing, we could be forced to sell assets or secure additional financing to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances. However, we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all and, in addition, the terms of the indenture governing our notes limit our ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale. We may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations, including our obligations under our notes.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we would be in default under the terms of our credit agreement and indenture governing our notes, permitting acceleration of the amounts due under the credit agreement and the notes and eliminating our ability to draw on the Revolver. If the amounts outstanding under the credit facilities, the notes, or future indebtedness were to be accelerated, we could be forced to file for bankruptcy.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and the Securities Markets\nBecause we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying any dividends on shares of our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made by our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial conditions, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Accordingly, realization of a gain on stockholders\u2019 investments will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders purchased their shares.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to influence corporate matters, and could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and make it more difficult for a stockholder to elect directors of its choosing.\nAs of February 28, 2020, our executive officers, directors, and affiliated entities together beneficially owned approximately 47% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, four additional investors each held more than 5% of our common stock, representing approximately 24% of our common stock in aggregate. As a result, our management and these other stockholders have the ability to exert significant control over matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of these stockholders might conflict with your interests as a holder of our securities, and it may cause us to pursue transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions may involve significant risks to you as a security\nholder. The large concentration of ownership in a small group of stockholders might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur operations or expansion efforts may require substantial additional financial, operational, and managerial resources. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity as of December 31, 2019 to fund our working capital and other operating requirements, we may raise additional funds for acquisitions or to expand our operations. If we obtain additional funding in the future, we may seek debt financing or obtain additional equity capital. Additional capital may not be available to us, or may only be available on terms that adversely affect our existing stockholders, or that restrict our operations. For example, if we raise additional funds through issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our existing indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could impact our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, or lines of credit, in the future as well as impact our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all, which could affect our strategic operations and our financial performance and force modifications to our operations.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Sale of our Infrastructure Division\nWhile a proposed sale of our Infrastructure Division is pending, we may be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial position and/or cash flows or result in a loss of employees, clients, members, providers, or suppliers.\nIn November 2019, we announced that we are exploring the sale of our Infrastructure Division, which includes our pan-European fiber network, subsea transatlantic fiber, and data center infrastructure that we acquired as part of our Interoute and Hibernia acquisitions. At this time we have not agreed with any party regarding a sale transaction and we have no obligation to complete a sale transaction.\nUndertaking this sale process may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us and also divert management\u2019s attention and our resources from ongoing business and operations. Moreover, if we were to enter into an agreement to sell our Infrastructure Division, it is likely that the purchase and sale agreement would include certain restrictions on the conduct of our Infrastructure Division\u2019s business prior to the completion of the transaction, requiring us to conduct the business in the ordinary course and subject to certain specified limitations absent the purchaser\u2019s prior written consent. These and other contractual restrictions in the purchase and sale agreement could delay or prevent us from responding, or limit our ability to respond, effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future business opportunities that may arise during such period, even if our management believes they may be advisable.\nIn addition, our clients, suppliers, and employees may experience uncertainties about the effects of the proposed sale. It is possible that some clients, suppliers, and other parties with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change, or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the proposed sale. Similarly, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the proposed sale, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact our stock and/or bond prices, operating results, financial position and/or cash flows.\nFailure to complete the sale of our Infrastructure Division could negatively impact our stock and/or bond prices, operating results, financial position, and/or cash flows.\nIf the proposed sale of our Infrastructure Division is not completed for any reason, our financial position, operating results, and/or cash flows and our stock and/or bond prices may be materially and adversely affected, and we will not have realized any of the potential benefits of having completed the transaction. In particular, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock and bond prices, and from our clients, vendors, regulators, and employees.", "PERMNO": 13993, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "GTT"}
