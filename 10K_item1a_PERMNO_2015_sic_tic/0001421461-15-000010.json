{"cik": "1421461", "company": "Intrepid Potash, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur potash sales are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nHistorically, the market for potash has been cyclical, and the prices and demand for potash have fluctuated. Periods of high demand, increasing profits, and high-capacity utilization tend to lead to new plant investment and increased production. This growth continues until the market is over-saturated, leading to decreased prices and lower-capacity utilization until the cycle repeats. Also, individual potash producers have, at times, independently suspended production in response to market outlook. As a result of these various factors, the prices and demand for potash can be volatile. This volatility could reduce profit margins and negatively affect our results of operations. We sell the majority of our potash into the spot market in the U.S. In addition, there is no active hedge market for potash as compared to many other commodities. As a result, we do not have protection from this price and demand volatility.\nChanges in fertilizer application rates could exacerbate the cyclical nature of the prices and demand for our products.\nFarmers attempt to apply the optimum amounts of fertilizer to maximize their economic returns. A farmer\u2019s decision about the application rate for each fertilizer, or the decision to forgo the application of a fertilizer, particularly potash and Trio\u00ae, varies from year to year depending on a number of factors. These factors include crop prices, weather patterns, fertilizer and other crop input costs, and the level of crop nutrients remaining in the soil following the previous harvest. Farmers are more likely to increase application rates of fertilizers when crop prices are relatively high, fertilizer and other crop input costs are relatively low, or the level of crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively low. Conversely, farmers are likely to reduce application of fertilizers when farm economics are weak or declining or the level of crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively high. This variability in application rates can impact the cyclical nature of the prices and demand for our products. In addition, farmers may buy and apply potash or Trio\u00ae in excess of current crop needs, which results in a build-up of potassium in the soil that can be used by crops in subsequent crop years. If this occurs, demand for our products could be delayed to future periods.\nAggressive pricing or operating strategies by other potash producers could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nThe potash industry is concentrated, with a relatively small number of producers accounting for the majority of global production. Many of these producers have significantly larger operations and more resources than we do and mine potash from reserves that are thicker, higher-grade, and less geologically complex than our reserves. These larger producers may have greater leverage in pricing negotiations with customers and transportation providers. They may also be able to mine their potash at a lower cost due to economies of scale or other competitive advantages. In addition, they may decide to pursue aggressive or new pricing or operating strategies that disrupt the global and U.S. potash markets. These disruptions could cause lower prices or demand for our product, which would adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nAdverse conditions in the global economy and disruptions in the financial markets could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal economic volatility and uncertainty can create uncertainty for farmers and customers in the geographic areas where we sell our products. If farmers reduce, delay, or forgo their potash and Trio\u00ae purchases due to this uncertainty, our results of operations would be adversely affected. Moreover, volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could limit our customers\u2019 ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products, which would decrease our sales volume. Changes in governmental banking, monetary, and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective. It is difficult to determine the extent of economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they could negatively affect our customers and business. In addition, if we are required to raise additional capital or obtain additional credit during an economic downturn, we could be unable to do so on favorable terms or at all.\nIf we are required to write down the value of our inventories, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market. In periods when the market prices for our products fall below our cost to produce them and the lower prices are not expected to be temporary, we are required to write down the value of our inventories. Any write-down would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, possibly materially.\nMining is a complex process that frequently experiences production disruptions. Because of the nature of our operations, we could be more vulnerable to these disruptions than our competitors, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe process of mining is complex. Production delays can occur due to equipment failures, unusual or unexpected geological conditions, environmental hazards, acts of nature, and other unexpected events or problems. In addition, we must transport mined ore for long distances to remove it from the mines for processing, which creates a higher probability of incidents. Many of our facilities have had long service lives and may require more maintenance or be more likely to fail than newer facilities or equipment. For example, the shafts at our West mine were constructed in 1931, are located in an area of known subsidence, and require frequent maintenance due to water inflow, wooden structures, and salt build-up. Additionally, at our East mine, the mining of langbeinite ore, which is harder and more abrasive than sylvite ore, has caused greater wear on our equipment, thereby increasing the expense and frequency of maintenance and repairs. Operational difficulties can also arise from our milling processes. For example, the mill at our East mine experiences build-ups of complex salts, an undesirable by-product of langbeinite production that we must remove. In addition, the mixed ore body, which contains sulfates, can cause changes in brine chemistry that may impact potash production. Furthermore, production at our facilities is dependent upon the maintenance and geotechnical structural integrity of our tailings and storage ponds. The amounts that we are required to spend on maintenance and repairs may be significant. Production delays and stoppages, and higher-than-expected maintenance and repair expense, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nMining is a hazardous process, and accidents occurring in the course of our operating activities could result in significant costs or production delays.\nThe process of mining is hazardous and involves various risks and hazards that can result in serious accidents. If unforeseen accidents or events occur, or if our safety procedures are not effective, we could be subject to liabilities arising out of personal injuries or death, our operations could be interrupted, or we could be required to shut down or abandon affected facilities. Accidents could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or repair damaged facilities.\nExisting or expanded oil and gas development near our mines could result in methane gas leaking from an oil and gas well into our mines. We test our mines daily for methane gas. However, unlike coal mines, our mines are not constructed or equipped to deal with methane gas. Any intrusion of methane gas into our mines could cause an explosion resulting in loss of life or significant property damage or could require the suspension of all mining operations until the completion of extensive modifications and re-equipping of the mine. The costs of modifying our mines and equipment could make it uneconomical to\nreopen our mines. You can find more information about the co-development of potash and oil and gas resources in the Designated Potash Area under the risk factor below entitled \u201cExisting and further oil and gas development in the Designated Potash Area could impair our potash reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\"\nThe grade of ore that we mine could vary from our projections due to the complex geology and mineralogy of potash reserves, which could adversely affect our potash production and our results of operations.\nPotash ore bodies have complex geology. Our potash production is affected by the potassium content and other mineralogy of the ore. Our projections of ore grade may not be accurate. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore grade, including many factors beyond our control. An unexpected reduction in the grade of our ore reserves would decrease our potash production because we would need to process more ore to produce the same amount of saleable-grade product. As a result, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf the assumptions underlying our reserve estimates are inaccurate, the quantities and value of our reserves, and in turn our financial condition and results of operations, could be adversely affected.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating our potash and langbeinite reserves. As a result, our reserve estimates necessarily depend upon a number of assumptions, including the following:\n\u2022\ngeologic and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and may differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine or operate\n\u2022\nfuture potash prices, operating costs, capital expenditures, royalties, severance and excise taxes, and development and reclamation costs\n\u2022\nfuture mining technology improvements\n\u2022\nthe effects of governmental regulation\n\u2022\nvariations in mineralogy\nIn addition, because reserves are only estimates built on various assumptions, they cannot be audited for the purpose of verifying exactness. It is only after extraction that reserve estimates can be compared to actual values to adjust estimates of the remaining reserves. If any of the assumptions that we make in connection with our reserve estimates are incorrect, the amounts of potash and langbeinite that we are able to economically recover from our mines could be significantly lower than our reserve estimates. In turn, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe seasonal demand for our products, and the resulting variations in our cash flows from quarter to quarter, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and working capital requirements.\nThe fertilizer business is seasonal. We typically experience increased sales during the North American spring and fall application seasons. The degree of seasonality can change significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns. We and our customers generally build inventories during low-demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during high-demand periods, resulting in increased working capital requirements just before the start of these seasons. If we are unable to accurately predict the timing of demand for our products due to variations in seasonality from year to year, our results of operations and working capital requirements could be adversely affected.\nChanges in laws and regulations affecting our business, or changes in enforcement practices, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our operations, objectives, or reporting practices in ways that adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, or new interpretations of or enforcement practices with respect to existing laws and regulations, could similarly impact our business.\nFor example, we are subject to significant regulation under MSHA and OSHA. High-profile mining accidents could prompt governmental authorities to enact new laws and regulations that apply to our operations or to more strictly enforce existing laws and regulations.\nPhysical effects of climate change, and climate change legislation, could have a negative effect on our operations and results of operations.\nThe potential physical effects of climate change could have an adverse effect on us and our customers. These effects could include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels. These changes could have an adverse effect on our costs, production, or sales. These changes could also have an adverse effect on our customers, which in turn could reduce the demand or price for our products.\nIn addition, federal and state legislators and regulators regularly consider ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to mitigate climate change. Any new rules could have a significant impact on our operations and products and could result in substantial additional costs for us.\nOur business depends on skilled and experienced workers, and our inability to find and retain quality workers could have an adverse effect on our development and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled managers, engineers, and other workers. At times, we may not be able to find or retain qualified workers. In particular, the labor market around Carlsbad, New Mexico, is very competitive and employee turnover is generally high. In that market, we compete for experienced workers with several other employers, including natural resource facilities, oil fields, and other potash facilities. In addition, there is high demand globally for technical mining talent. If we are not able to attract and retain quality workers, the development of our business could suffer or we could be required to raise wages to keep our employees, hire less qualified workers, or incur higher training costs. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in the prices of energy and other important materials used in our business, or disruptions to their supply, could adversely impact our sales, results of operations, or financial condition.\nNatural gas, electricity, steel, water, chemicals, diesel, and gasoline are key materials that we purchase and use in the production of our products. The prices of these commodities are volatile.\nOur sales and profitability are impacted by the price and availability of these materials. A significant increase in the price of these materials that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our products, or an extended interruption in the supply of these materials to our production facilities, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, high natural gas or other fuel costs could increase crop input costs for farmers, which could cause our sales to decline.\nAny decline in U.S. agricultural production or any limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could adversely affect the markets for our products and our results of operations.\nThe U.S. agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors, including weather patterns, field conditions, current and projected grain inventories and prices, the domestic and international demand for U.S. agricultural products, and U.S. and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products. State and federal governmental policies, including farm and ethanol subsidies and commodity support programs, may also influence the number of acres planted, the mix of crops planted, and the use of fertilizers. In addition, there are various city, county, and state initiatives to regulate the use and application of fertilizers due to various environmental concerns. If U.S. agricultural production or fertilizer use decreased significantly due to one or more of these factors, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA decline in oil and gas drilling or a reduction in the use of potash in drilling fluids could increase our operating costs and decrease our average net realized sales price of potash.\nA significant portion of our revenue comes from the sale of potassium chloride for use in oil and gas drilling fluids. A decline in oil and gas drilling could reduce our sales into this industrial market. In addition, alternative products that have some of the same clay-inhibiting properties as potash are commercially available. These alternative products could temporarily or permanently replace some of our sales into the industrial market. If a significant amount of our sales into the industrial market shifted to the agricultural market due to any of these factors, our average net realized sales price of potash could decline.\nIncreased costs could affect our per-ton profitability.\nA substantial portion of our operating costs is comprised of fixed costs that do not vary based on production levels. These fixed costs include labor and benefits, base energy usage, property taxes, insurance, maintenance expenditures, and depreciation. Any increase in fixed costs or decrease in production generally increases our per-ton costs and correspondingly decreases our per-ton operating margin. As a result, a significant increase in costs at any of our facilities could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows, particularly during periods of decreasing potash prices.\nA shortage of railcars or trucks for transporting our products, increased transit times, or interruptions in railcar or truck transportation could result in customer dissatisfaction, loss of sales, higher transportation or equipment costs, or disruptions in production.\nWe rely heavily upon truck and rail transportation to deliver our products to our customers. In addition, the cost of transportation is an important component of the price of our products. A shortage of trucks or railcars for carrying product or increased transit times due to accidents, highway or railway disruptions, congestion, high demand, labor disputes, adverse weather, natural disasters, changes to transportation systems, or other events could prevent us from making timely delivery to our customers or lead to higher transportation costs. As a result, we could experience customer dissatisfaction or a loss of sales.\nSimilarly, disruption within the transportation systems could negatively affect our ability to obtain the supplies and equipment necessary to produce our products. We may also have difficulty obtaining access to ships to deliver our products to overseas customers.\nWe rely on our management personnel for the development and execution of our business strategy, and the loss of one or more members of our management team could harm our business.\nOur management personnel have significant relevant industry and company-specific experience. Our senior management team has developed and implemented first-of-their-kind processes and other innovative ideas that are largely responsible for the success of our business. If we are unable to retain these individuals, our operations could be disrupted and we may be unable to achieve our business strategies and grow effectively. We do not currently maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on any of our management personnel.\nWeakening of the Canadian dollar and Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar could lead to lower domestic potash prices, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Fluctuations in these currencies could cause our results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe U.S. imports the majority of its potash from Canada and Russia. If the Canadian dollar and the Russian ruble strengthen in comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign suppliers realize a smaller margin in their local currencies unless they increase their nominal U.S. dollar prices. Strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Russian ruble therefore tends to support higher U.S. potash prices as Canadian and Russian potash producers attempt to maintain their margins. However, if the Canadian dollar and Russian ruble weaken in comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign competitors may choose to lower prices proportionally to increase sales volumes while again maintaining a margin in their local currency. These activities could cause our sales prices and results of operations to decrease or fluctuate significantly.\nExisting and further oil and gas development in the Designated Potash Area could impair our potash reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior regulates the development of federal mineral resources -both potash and oil and gas -on federal lands in the Designated Potash Area. This 497,000-acre region outside of Carlsbad, New Mexico, includes all of our New Mexico operations and facilities. In December 2012, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an updated order that provides guidance to the BLM and industry on the co-development of these resources.\nIt is possible that oil and gas drilling in this area could limit our ability to mine valuable potash reserves or mineralized deposits because of setbacks from oil and gas wells and the establishment of unminable buffer areas around oil or gas wells. It is also possible that the BLM could determine that the size of these unminable buffer areas should be larger than they are currently, which could impact our ability to mine our potash reserves. We review applications for permits to drill oil and gas wells as they are publicly disclosed by the BLM and the State of New Mexico. When appropriate, we protest applications for drilling permits that we believe should not be drilled consistent with the operative federal and state rules and that could impair our ability to mine our potash reserves or put at risk the safety of our potash miners. We may not prevail in these protests or be able to prevent wells from being drilled in the vicinity of our potash reserves. If, notwithstanding our protests and appeals, a sufficient number of wells are drilled through or near our potash reserves, our potash reserves could be significantly impaired, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain the required permits, governmental approvals, and leases necessary for our operations, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe hold numerous environmental, mining, safety, and other permits and governmental approvals authorizing the operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a governmental agency to deny or delay a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could prevent or limit us from continuing our operations at the affected facility, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny expansion of our existing operations would also require us to secure the necessary environmental and other permits and approvals. We may not be able to obtain these permits and approvals in a timely manner or at all. In addition, the federal government must consider and study a project\u2019s likely environmental impacts. Based on the federal government\u2019s conclusion, it could require an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement as a condition of approving a project or permit, which could result in significant time delays and costs. Furthermore, many of our operations take place on land that is leased from federal and state governmental authorities. Expansion of our existing operations could require securing additional federal and state leases. We may not be able to obtain these leases in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our existing leases generally require us to commence mining operations within a specified time frame and to continue mining in order to retain the lease. The loss of a lease could adversely affect our ability to mine the associated reserves.\nAlso, our existing leases require us to make royalty payments based on the revenue generated by the potash we produce from the leased land. The royalty rates are subject to change whenever we renew our leases, which could lead to significant increases in these rates. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 18% of our state and federal lease acres at our New Mexico facilities (including leases at the HB and North mines) and 2% of our state and federal lease acres at our Utah operations will be up for renewal within the next five years. Increases in royalty rates would reduce our profit margins and, if the increases were significant, would adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe execution of strategic projects could require more time and costs than we expect, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we invest time and money into strategic projects. The completion of these projects could require significantly more time and costs than we expect. In some cases, the construction or commissioning processes could force us to slow or shut down normal operations at the affected facility for a period of time, which would cause lower production volumes and higher production costs per ton. In addition, our management team and other employees may be required to spend a significant amount of time addressing strategic projects, which could mean that our normal operations receive less time and attention.\nWe are considering various potential opportunities for revenue and strategic growth, including solution mining the Amax/Horizon mine or reopening the idled North mine. These potential projects are at an early stage, and we may not proceed with any of them. Even if we proceed with one or more future strategic projects, they may not succeed despite substantial investments, they may cost significantly more than we expect, or we may encounter additional risks that we did not initially expect.\nOur Trio\u00ae sales could be affected by market entrants or the introduction of langbeinite alternatives.\nLangbeinite is produced by Intrepid and one other company from the only known langbeinite reserves in the world, which is located near Carlsbad, New Mexico. Additional competition in the market for langbeinite and comparable products exists and could increase in the future. Other companies could seek to create and market chemically similar alternatives to langbeinite. The market for langbeinite and our Trio\u00ae sales could be affected by the success of these and other products that are competitive with langbeinite, which could adversely affect the viability of our Trio\u00ae business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are less diversified than nearly all of our competitors, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dedicated exclusively to the production and marketing of potash and langbeinite, whereas nearly all of our competitors are diversified, primarily into nitrogen- or phosphate-based fertilizer businesses or other chemical or industrial businesses. Because we are focused exclusively on potash and langbeinite, and because we sell our products primarily within the U.S., we could be impacted more acutely by factors affecting our industry or the regions in which we operate than we would if our business was more diversified and our sales more global. A decrease in the demand for potash and langbeinite would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, if global potash production increases beyond potash demand, the price at which we sell our potash and our sales volume would likely fall, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition more than our diversified competitors.\nInflows of water into our potash mines from heavy rainfall or groundwater could result in increased costs and production downtime and could require us to abandon a mine, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nMajor weather events such as heavy rainfall can result in water inflows into our mines. The potential effects of climate change may increase the possibility of heavy rainfall that results in water inflows into our mines. Additionally, the presence of water-bearing strata in many underground mines carries the risk of water inflows into the mines. If we experience water inflows at our mines, our employees could be injured and our equipment and mine shafts could be seriously damaged. We could be forced to shut down the affected mine temporarily, potentially resulting in significant production delays, and spend substantial funds to repair or replace damaged equipment. Inflows may also destabilize the mine shafts over time, resulting in safety hazards for employees and potentially leading to the permanent abandonment of a mine.\nHeavy precipitation or low evaporation rates at our solar solution mines could impact our potash production at those facilities, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nOur HB, Moab and Wendover facilities use solar evaporation ponds to form potash crystals from brines. Weather conditions could negatively impact potash production at these facilities. For example, heavy rainfall in September and October, just after the evaporation season ends, can reduce the amount of potash we produce in that year or the following year by causing the potash crystals to dissolve and consume pond capacity. Similarly, lower-than-average temperatures or higher-than-average seasonal rainfall would reduce evaporation rates and therefore impact production. The potential effects of climate change may increase the possibility of adverse weather conditions. If we experience heavy rainfall or low evaporation rates at any of our solar solution mines, we would have less potash available for sale, and our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. As we increase the level of production associated with our use of solar ponds, our production risks related to rainfall and evaporation rates increase.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability and require us to incur additional costs.\nWe are subject to many environmental, safety, and health laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to mine safety, mine land reclamation, remediation of hazardous substance releases, and discharges into the soil, air, and water.\nOur operations, as well as those of our predecessors, have involved the use and handling of regulated substances, hydrocarbons, potash, salt, related potash and salt by-products, and process tailings. These operations resulted, or may have resulted, in soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination. At some locations, salt-processing waste, building materials (including asbestos-containing material), and ordinary trash may have been disposed or buried in areas that have since been closed and covered with soil and other materials.\nWe could incur significant liabilities under environmental remediation laws such as CERCLA with regard to our current or former facilities, adjacent or nearby third party facilities, or off-site disposal locations. Under CERCLA and similar state laws, under some circumstances, liability may be imposed without regard to fault or legality of conduct and one party may be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site. Liability under these laws involves inherent uncertainties.\nWe are also subject to federal and state environmental laws that regulate discharges of pollutants and contaminants into the environment, such as the U.S. Clean Water Act and the U.S. Clean Air Act. For example, our water disposal processes rely on dikes and reclamation ponds that could breach or leak, resulting in a possible prohibited release into the environment. Moreover, although the North and East mines in New Mexico and the Moab mine in Utah are designated as zero discharge facilities under the applicable water quality laws and regulations, these mines could experience some water discharges during significant rainfall events.\nWe expect that we will be required to continue to invest in environmental controls at our facilities and that these expenses could be significant. In addition, violations of environmental, health, and safety laws could subject us to civil and, in some cases, criminal sanctions. We could also be required to invest in additional equipment, facilities, or employees, or could incur significant liabilities, due to any of the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in the interpretation of environmental laws\n\u2022\nmodifications to current environmental laws\n\u2022\nthe issuance of more stringent environmental laws\n\u2022\nmalfunctioning process or pollution control equipment\nMining and processing of potash also generates residual materials that must be managed both during the operation of the facility and upon facility closure. For example, potash tailings, consisting primarily of salt, iron, and clay, are stored in surface disposal sites and require management. At least one of our New Mexico facilities, the HB mine, may have issues regarding lead in the tailings pile as a result of operations conducted by previous owners. During the life of the tailings management areas, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs to manage potash residual materials in accordance with environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements.\nAs a potash producer, we currently are exempt from certain State of New Mexico mining laws related to reclamation obligations. If this exemption were to be eliminated or restricted, we could be required to incur significant expenses related to reclamation at our New Mexico facilities.\nFor more information about environmental, health, and safety matters affecting our business, see \u201cBusiness-Environmental, Health and Safety Matters.\u201d\nCurrent and future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business.\nWe have outstanding $150 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes (\u201cthe Notes\u201d). We also have an unsecured credit facility that allows us to borrow up to an additional $250 million, subject to the operation of financial covenants, as described below.\nCurrent and future indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit could limit our ability to borrow additional money or sell additional shares of common stock to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements\n\u2022\nit could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business\n\u2022\nwe could become more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage\n\u2022\nit could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy\n\u2022\nit could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes\n\u2022\nit could adversely affect our business and financial condition if we are unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, as needed\nOur debt agreements contain financial and other restrictive covenants. These covenants could limit our ability to engage in activities that are in our long-term best interests or limit our ability to access the full amount of the credit facility. In addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness.\nThe Notes and credit facility contain two financial covenants. First, our leverage ratio, or the ratio of our total funded indebtedness to our adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other expenses, as defined in the Notes and credit facility), for the prior four fiscal quarters may not exceed 3.5 to 1. Second, our fixed charge coverage ratio, or the ratio of our adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges for the prior four fiscal quarters may not fall below 1.3 to 1. Although we are currently in compliance with each of these financial covenants, they also may operate to limit the amount available to us under the credit facility. For example, as of December 31, 2014, $211 million was available to us under the credit facility as a result of lower levels of adjusted EBITDA over the prior four fiscal quarters. Based on current market conditions, we expect that the amount available to us under the credit facility will continue to be limited during 2015.\nThe credit facility is scheduled to expire in 2018 and the Notes are due in 2020, 2023, and 2025. In the future, we may be unable to obtain new financing or financing on acceptable terms.\nThe mining business is capital intensive, and our inability to fund necessary or desirable capital expenditures could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability.\nThe mining business is capital intensive. We may find it necessary or desirable to make significant capital expenditures in the future to sustain or expand our existing operations. If costs associated with capital expenditures increase or if our earnings decrease significantly, we could have difficulty funding any necessary or desirable capital expenditures at an acceptable rate or at all. This could limit the expansion of our production or make it difficult for us to sustain our existing operations at optimal levels. Increased costs for capital expenditures could also have an adverse effect on the profitability of our existing operations and returns from our most recent strategic projects.\nMarket upheavals due to global pandemics, military actions, terrorist attacks, or economic repercussions from those events could reduce our sales or increase our costs.\nGlobal pandemics, actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, or military or trade disruptions affecting the areas where we or our competitors do business could disrupt the global market for potash. As a result, our competitors may increase their sales efforts in our geographic markets and pricing of potash could suffer. If this occurs, we could lose sales to our competitors or be forced to lower our prices. In addition, due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives, local, state, and federal governments could implement new regulations impacting the production, transportation, sale, or use of potash. These new regulations could result in lower sales or higher costs.\nA significant disruption to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on a variety of information technology and automated operating systems to manage or support our operations. The proper functioning of these systems is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. In addition, these systems could require modifications or upgrades as of a result of technological changes or growth in our business. These changes could be costly and disruptive to our operations, and could impose substantial demands on management time. Our systems, and those of third party providers, also could be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, viruses or malware, physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized access, and cyber-attacks. Although we take steps to secure our systems and electronic information, these security measures may not be adequate. Any significant disruption to our systems could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business may be adversely affected by union activities.\nHourly employees at our Wendover facility are represented by a labor union. These employees represent approximately 3.6% of our workforce. Our current collective bargaining agreement with the union expires on May 31, 2017. Although we believe that our relations with our unionized employees are good, we may not be successful in negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement as a result of general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, political, and other factors beyond our control. Any new agreement could result in a significant increase in our labor costs.
