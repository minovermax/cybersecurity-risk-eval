{"cik": "826154", "company": "ORRSTOWN FINANCIAL SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to Credit\nThe Company may be required to make further increases in the provisions for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future, which could materially adversely affect it.\nThere is no precise method of predicting loan losses and the required level of reserves, and related provision for loan losses, can fluctuate from year to year, based on charge-offs and/or recoveries, loan volume, credit administration practices, and local and national economic conditions, among other factors. For 2015, we recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $603,000. The Company recorded net charge-offs of $576,000 in 2015 compared to net charge-offs of $2,318,000 in 2014. Risk elements, including nonperforming loans, troubled debt restructurings still accruing, loans greater than 90 days past due still accruing, and other real estate owned totaled $18,084,000 at December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s evaluation of, among other factors, the status of specific impaired loans, trends in historical loss experience, delinquency, credit concentrations and economic conditions within our market area. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase the provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that differ from those of management. If loan charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, there could be a need to record additional provisions to increase our allowance for loan losses. Furthermore, growth in the loan portfolio would generally lead to an increase in the provision for loan losses. Generally, increases in our allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and stockholders\u2019 equity, and may have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe allowance for loan losses was 1.74% of total loans and 78% of nonaccrual and restructured loans still accruing at December 31, 2015, compared to 2.09% of total loans and 95% of nonaccrual and restructured loans still accruing at December 31, 2014. Material additions to the allowance could materially decrease our net income. In addition, at December 31, 2015, the top 25 lending relationships individually had commitments of approximately $356,300,000, and an aggregate total outstanding loan balance of $298,427,000, or 38% of the loan portfolio. The deterioration of one or more of these loans could result in a significant increase in the nonperforming loans and the provisions for loan losses, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nCommercial real estate lending may expose us to a greater risk of loss and impact our earnings and profitability.\nOur business strategy involves making loans secured by commercial real estate. These types of loans generally have higher risk-adjusted returns and shorter maturities than other loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate properties are generally for larger amounts and may involve a greater degree of risk than other loans. Payments on loans secured by these properties are often dependent on the income produced by the underlying properties which, in turn, depends on the successful operation and management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans is subject to conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. Because of the current challenging economic environment, these loans represent higher risk, could result in an increase in our total net-charge offs and could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. While we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.\nAlmost 10% of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and industrial loans. The credit risk related to these types of loans is greater than the risk related to residential loans.\nOur commercial and industrial loan portfolio grew by $24.6 million, or approximately 50%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $73.6 million at December 31, 2015. Commercial and industrial loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a greater degree of risk of nonpayment or late payment than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans.\nCommercial and industrial loans include advances to local and regional businesses for general commercial purposes and include permanent and short-term working capital, machinery and equipment financing, and may be either in the form of lines of credit or term loans. Although commercial and industrial loans may be unsecured to our highest rated borrowers, the majority of these loans are secured by the borrower\u2019s accounts receivable, inventory and machinery and equipment. In a significant number of these loans, the collateral also includes the business real estate or the business owner\u2019s personal real estate or assets. Commercial and industrial loans present credit exposure to the Company, as they are more susceptible to risk of loss during a downturn in the economy, as borrowers may have greater difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and the value of the collateral may decline. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk through its underwriting standards, including evaluating the credit worthiness of the borrower and to the extent available, credit ratings on the business. Additionally, monitoring of the loans through annual renewals and meetings with the borrowers are typical. However, these procedures cannot eliminate the risk of loss associated with commercial and industrial lending.\nOur commercial and industrial lending operations are located primarily in South Central Pennsylvania and in Washington County, Maryland. Our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay these loans depend largely on economic conditions in these and surrounding areas. A deterioration in the economic conditions in these market areas could materially adversely affect our operations and increase loan delinquencies, increase problem assets and foreclosures, increase claims and lawsuits, decrease the demand for our products and services and decrease the value of collateral securing loans.\nRisks Related to Interest Rates and Investments\nChanges in interest rates could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating income, net income and liquidity depend to a great extent on our net interest margin, i.e., the difference between the interest yields we receive on loans, securities and other interest earning assets and the interest rates we pay on interest-bearing deposits, borrowings and other liabilities. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities, including the FRB. If the rate of interest we pay on our interest-bearing deposits, borrowings and other liabilities increases more than the rate of interest we receive on loans, securities and other interest earning assets, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings, and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Our earnings and liquidity could also be materially adversely affected if the rates on our loans, securities and other investments fall more quickly than those on our deposits, borrowings and other liabilities. Our operations are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding our exposure to changes in the interest rate environment.\nAdditionally, based on an analysis of the interest rate sensitivity of the Company\u2019s assets, an increase in the general level of interest rates will negatively affect the market value of the investment portfolio because of the relatively long duration of certain securities included in the investment portfolio.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect: (1) the ability to originate loans; (2) the value of interest-earning assets, which would negatively impact stockholders\u2019 equity, and the ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets; (3) the ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and (4) the ability of borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans.\nRisks Related to Competition and to Our Business Strategy\nDifficult economic and market conditions have adversely affected the financial services industry and may continue to materially and adversely affect the Company.\nWe are operating in a volatile economic environment, including generally uncertain global, national and local conditions. Additional concerns from some of the countries in the European Union, Russian Federation, China and elsewhere have also strained the financial markets both abroad and domestically. Although there has been some improvement in the overall global macroeconomic conditions in 2015, financial institutions continue to be affected by conditions in the real estate market and the constrained financial markets. In recent years, declines in the housing market, increases in unemployment and under-employment have negatively impacted the credit performance of loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including the Bank. While the Company saw continued improvement in 2015, a worsening of\neconomic conditions, or a prolonged inconsistent recovery, may further impact the Bank\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u2022\nLoan delinquencies could increase further;\n\u2022\nProblem assets and foreclosures could increase further;\n\u2022\nDemand for our products and services could decline;\n\u2022\nCollateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, could decline further in value, in turn reducing a customer\u2019s borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans.\nAs these conditions or similar ones continue to exist or worsen, we may experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our business is concentrated in South Central Pennsylvania and Washington County, Maryland, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected by economic conditions and real estate values in these market areas.\nOur operations and the properties securing our loans are primarily located in South Central Pennsylvania and in Washington County, Maryland. Our operating results depend largely on economic conditions and real estate valuations in these and surrounding areas. A deterioration in the economic conditions in these market areas could materially adversely affect our operations and increase loan delinquencies, increase problem assets and foreclosures, increase claims and lawsuits, decrease the demand for our products and services and decrease the value of collateral securing loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with nonperforming loans and collateral coverage.\nCompetition from other banks and financial institutions in originating loans, attracting deposits and providing various financial services may adversely affect profitability and liquidity.\nWe experience substantial competition in originating loans, both commercial and consumer loans, in our market area. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Some of our competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources, and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce our net income and liquidity by decreasing the number and size of loans that we originate and the interest rates we are able to charge on these loans.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, we face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Some of our competitors enjoy advantages, including more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do, which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could materially adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, we may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase our cost of funds.\nThe Company\u2019s business strategy includes the continuation of moderate growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nIn 2015, loans grew $76,767,000, or 10.9% from $704,946,000 at January 1, 2015, to $781,713,000 at December 31, 2015, due to organic growth through increases in consumer, commercial and commercial real estate loans. Over the long term, we expect to continue to experience growth in loans and total assets, the level of our deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets requires us to successfully execute our business strategies, which include continuing to grow our loan portfolio. Our ability to successfully grow will also depend on the continued availability of loan opportunities that meet underwriting standards. In addition, since our asset quality metrics have returned closer to historical levels, we may consider the acquisition of other financial institutions and branches within or outside of our market area to the extent permitted by our regulators, the success of which will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to integrate the acquired institutions or branches into the current operations of the Company, our ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by customers of the acquired institution or branch locations, our ability to control the incremental increase in non-interest expense arising from any acquisition and our ability to retain and integrate the appropriate personnel of the acquired institution or branches. We believe we have the resources and internal systems in place to successfully achieve and manage our future growth. If we do not manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to achieve our business plan, and our business and prospects could be harmed.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by technological advances.\nTechnological advances impact our business. The banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving customer services, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our current and prospective customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations.\nThe Company may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain skilled people. We have experienced turnover among our senior officers. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and hire sufficiently skilled people to fill open and newly created positions or to retain current or future employees. An inability to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills to fill open positions, or the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel, could have a material adverse impact on our business due to the loss of their skills, knowledge of our markets, years of industry experience or the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nAn interruption or breach in security with respect to our information system, or our outsourced service providers, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation and have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nInformation systems are critical to our business. We use various technological systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits and loans. We rely on software, communication, and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the internet. We have established policies and procedures in place to prevent or limit the effect of system failures, interruptions and security breaches, but we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from security breaches.\nWe rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nIf information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and we could be exposed to claims from customers. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.\nA failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of us. We continue to devote a significant amount of effort and resources to continually strengthening our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and banking regulations.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance and Legal Matters\nGovernmental regulation and regulatory actions against us may impair our operations or restrict our growth.\nThe Company is subject to regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The requirements and limitations imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit our shareholders. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is within our control. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied or enforced. The Company cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation, regulation or the application thereof. Compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. Bank regulations can hinder our ability to compete with financial services companies that are not regulated in the same manner or are subject to less regulation.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and stock price.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions, including several provisions that will profoundly affect how community banks and bank holding companies will be regulated in the future. Among other things, these provisions relax rules regarding interstate branching, allow financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, change the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage and impose new capital requirements on bank holding companies. Many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented over time and most will be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators.\nThe Company may be required to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While the Company cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nMarket developments significantly depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. As a result, the Company may be required to pay significantly higher premiums or additional special assessments or taxes that could adversely affect earnings. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that are required to be paid for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, the Company may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the levels currently imposed. Any future increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect the results of operations.\nChanges in assessment rates of the Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax, a tax calculated on the outstanding equity of the Bank, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe Government of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has yet to agree on a budget for the fiscal year 2015-2016, and forecast revenues generated are not sufficient to meet forecast expenditures. One tax subject to continue deliberation, which the Bank is currently subject to, is the Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax. This tax is currently assessed at 0.89% of eligible capital. As part of the budget negotiation, the assessment rate has been discussed as one which may be increased to cover the deficiency in the Commonwealth's budget. If this assessment rate on the Pennsylvania Bank Shares tax is increased, including possible retroactive assessments, it may materially adversely affect the results of operations.\nThe Company is required to make a number of judgments in applying accounting policies and different estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies could result in a decrease in capital and/or other material changes to the reports of financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, accounting for income taxes and the ability to recognize the deferred tax asset, and the fair value of certain financial instruments, in particular securities. While we have identified those accounting policies that are considered critical and have procedures in place to facilitate the associated judgments, different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in a decrease to net income and, possibly, capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes, including a significant proposal which would change the accounting for the determination of the allowance for loan losses from a probable loss to an expected loss model, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In\nsome cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Company\u2019s prior period financial statements.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules is uncertain.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules which became effective for the Company and Bank on January 1, 2016, established a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations, including community banks, which also incorporate provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, compared to the previously effective U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios, address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios and replace the current risk-weighting approach.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements to the Company and the Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, result in the need for additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares.\nPending litigation and legal proceedings and the impact of any finding of liability or damages could adversely impact the Company and its financial condition and results of operations.\nAs set forth in Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the allegations of Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's (\"SEPTA\") proposed second amended complaint disclosed the existence of a confidential, non-public, fact-finding inquiry regarding the Company being conducted by the SEC. In cooperating fully with the SEC in connection with the inquiry, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant additional noninterest expenses for professional services such as legal fees. See \u201cNoninterest Expenses\" in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations\" as discussed in Part II, Item 7. The SEC\u2019s inquiry is not an indication that the SEC believes the Company or anyone else has violated federal securities laws or regulations. Nor does it mean that the SEC has a negative opinion of any person, entity, or security. If the SEC determines that there were violations of federal securities laws, the SEC could bring enforcement actions and/or monetary fines against the Company or certain individual former or current employees or directors of the Company, or administrative proceedings against the Company or its former or current employees or directors.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nThe Company is a holding company dependent for liquidity on payments from the Bank, its sole subsidiary, which is subject to restrictions.\nThe Company is a holding company and depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from the Bank to fund dividend payments and stock repurchases, if permitted, and to fund all payments on obligations. The Bank is subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from it to us. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the Bank\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the Bank\u2019s creditors.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems, losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of other banks\u2019 difficulties or failure, which would increase the capital we need to support such growth.\nRisks Related to Owning our Stock\nIf the Company wants to, or is compelled to, raise additional capital in the future, that capital may not be available when it is needed and on terms favorable to current shareholders.\nFederal banking regulators require us and our banking subsidiary to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. These capital levels are determined and dictated by law, regulation and banking regulatory agencies. In addition, capital levels are also determined by our management and board of directors based on capital levels that, they believe, are necessary to support our business operations. At December 31, 2015, all four capital ratios for us and our banking subsidiary were above regulatory minimum levels to be deemed \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under current bank regulatory guidelines. To be \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d banking companies generally must maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, CET1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%. In addition, beginning January 1, 2016, the implementation of the capital conservation buffer included in the Basel III capital rules will begin at the 0.625% level and will be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019), resulting in additional capital that will be required of the Bank.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital on terms and time frames acceptable to us or to raise additional capital at all. Additionally, the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole as evidenced by recent turmoil in the domestic and worldwide credit markets. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities, we would likely dilute the ownership interests of current investors and the price at which we issue additional shares of stock could be less than the current market price of our common stock and, thus, could dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of our common stock. Furthermore, a capital raise through the issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock has been subject to volatility.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been subject to fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated variations in our operational results and cash flows, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, trading volume, large purchases or sales of our common stock, market conditions within the banking industry, the general state of the securities markets and the market for stocks of financial institutions, as well as general economic conditions.", "PERMNO": 92919, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ORRF"}
