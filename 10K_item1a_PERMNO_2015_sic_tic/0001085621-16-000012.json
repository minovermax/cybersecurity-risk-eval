{"cik": "1085621", "company": "Actua Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur businesses involve a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. You should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties we describe below and all of the other information in this Report before deciding to invest in our stock. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties about which we currently do not know or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our businesses, financial condition or operating results.\nWe face intense competition and may not be able to compete successfully.\nOur businesses compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive cloud-based technology markets and are subject to ever-changing technology, shifting customer needs and preferences and frequent introduction of products and services. We expect competition in those markets to intensify in the coming years. Our businesses\u2019 current and potential competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups, both horizontally and vertically focused, some of whom receive or could receive, significant financial and other support from private equity and/or venture capital firms. Established companies, on the one hand, have greater resources, more comprehensive and complementary product and service offerings, longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers than we do. Those companies can use their experience and resources to compete with our businesses in a variety of ways, including by making acquisitions, investing aggressively in research and development and sales and marketing, and offering more attractive commercial terms to customers, service providers and other strategic partners. Emerging start-ups, on the other hand, may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than our businesses can. If our businesses\u2019 competitors are collectively more successful than our businesses are in developing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining customers, our consolidated revenues and growth rates could decline.\nIf the market for cloud-based software develops more slowly than we expect or declines, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe market for cloud-based software is not as mature as the market for on-premise enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether cloud-based software will achieve and sustain high levels of customer demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud-based software solutions. Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to cloud computing. Other enterprises have not elected to move from traditional processes that are not cloud-based to automated cloud-based processes. It is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our businesses\u2019 products and services, the future growth rate and size of the cloud-based software market or the entry of competitive applications. The expansion of the cloud-based software market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with cloud-based software, as well as the ability of cloud-based software companies to address heightened security and privacy concerns. If other cloud-based software providers experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery or other similar problems, which is an increasing focus of the public and investors in recent years, the market for cloud-based applications as a whole, including our products and services, may be negatively affected. If cloud-based software does not achieve widespread adoption, or there is a reduction in demand for cloud-based software caused by a lack of\ncustomer acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, increasing security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise, it could result in decreased revenues and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in the way analysts, investors and other participants in public and/or private markets value cloud-based businesses, such as those we currently own and those we could acquire, could adversely affect our stock price.\nOver the past few years, public and private cloud-based businesses have been valued based on relatively high multiples of their historical and/or forecasted revenues, with less of a focus on their current levels of profitability. Given the emphasis placed on the revenue growth of cloud-based businesses, we intend to continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing to drive revenue growth at our businesses. Analysts, investors and other market participants have recently valued cloud-based businesses, (particularly those that are relatively small), which comprise our core group of assets, based on lower revenue multiples, which has had, and could continue to have, a negative effect on our stock price. Additionally, if analysts, investors and other market participants begin to value cloud-based businesses like ours based on profitability or another metric other than revenue, our stock price could be adversely affected, regardless of the performance of those businesses. Moreover, our strategy calls for us to acquire additional cloud-based businesses and technologies. To the extent that we acquire any cloud-based business or technology based on current valuation practices/metrics, and those practices/metrics change as contemplated above, our stock price could be adversely affected, regardless of the performance of the business or technology that we acquire.\nThird-party attempts to breach or an actual breach of our networks or data security, or the existence of any other security vulnerabilities, could damage our reputation or the reputation of our businesses and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nNetwork and data security is particularly important for cloud-based software businesses, such as ours, which use Internet-based computing, storage, and connectivity technology to deliver their software products and services. Customers using our businesses\u2019 products and services rely on the security of computer networks and infrastructure for achieving reliable service and the protection of their data. As part of our businesses\u2019 cloud-based offerings, our businesses receive sensitive data. Although we have adopted a number of measures to enhance our cybersecurity protection at Actua and each of our businesses, there can be no assurance that our or our business' information will not be subject to cyberattacks, computer break-ins, theft and other improper activity that could jeopardize the security of information handled by our businesses\u2019 products and services or cause interruptions in the operations of our businesses. In addition, third parties that use or have access to our businesses\u2019 sensitive business information could experience security breaches that could adversely impact our reputation and customer relationships.\nCyberattacks and other malicious Internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and cloud-based platform providers have been targeted; therefore, we devote significant resources and incur significant costs to protect against security threats. Nevertheless, our security measures or those of third parties that use or have access to our businesses\u2019 sensitive business information may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our IT systems. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information, such as user names, passwords or other information, in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data or IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, we may not be able to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data. Because we do not control our customers and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities could cause us and our businesses to incur significant additional costs to alleviate problems caused by any such actual or perceived vulnerabilities. Those costs could reduce our operating margins and expose us and our businesses to litigation, loss of customers, reputation damage and other business harm that could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial condition.\nOur businesses could face material liability related to the disclosure or theft of personal information they store or have stored on their behalf.\nIf the personal information any of our businesses\u2019 clients, particularly FolioDyanmix\u2019s, were inappropriately disclosed, whether inadvertently or otherwise, or if third parties were able to penetrate our businesses\u2019 network security or otherwise gain access to any client\u2019s name, address, portfolio holdings, credit card information or other financial information, our companies could be subject to claims for misuses of personal information or violations of privacy laws or regulations, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. In addition, third parties that use or have access to our businesses\u2019 sensitive business information could experience security breaches that could adversely impact our reputation and customer relationships and could, in certain circumstances, expose us to liability and penalties for violations of privacy laws and regulations.\nInterruption of our businesses\u2019 operations, infrastructures or systems upon which they rely, including interruptions related to cyberattacks, could prevent them from delivering their products and services to their customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause our businesses are primarily conducted over the Internet, they depend on their abilities to protect computer equipment and the information stored in computer equipment, offices and hosting facilities against damage from earthquake, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyberattacks, terrorism unauthorized intrusion, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other events. There can be no assurance that our businesses\u2019 disaster preparedness or cybersecurity measures will prevent significant interruption of their operations. In addition, our businesses engage third-party facility providers for their hosting facilities and related infrastructure that is essential for their subscription services. Service to our businesses\u2019 customers could be interrupted in the event of a natural disaster, by a hosting provider decision to close a facility or terminate operations, by cyberattacks, by terriorism or by other unanticipated problems. Similarly, our businesses use third-party telecommunications providers for Internet and other telecommunication services. Any of those third-party providers may fail to perform their obligations adequately, and any third-party systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled for varying periods of time, causing business interruption, system damage, or inability to process funds on behalf of customers. An interruption of operations, infrastructures or systems could reduce our businesses\u2019 revenues, cause them to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions, cause other liability to customers, or cause regulatory intervention or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nOur businesses may become liable for damages to their customers for breaches of warranties and lose customers if they have errors, defects or disruptions in their service or if they provide poor service, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nOur businesses deliver cloud-based software and services. Errors or defects in the software applications underlying those services, failures of the hosting infrastructures of our businesses, or errors in the delivery of products and services may make our businesses\u2019 products and services unavailable to their customers, may cause disruptions in the operations of those customers and may cause those customers to suffer other harm. Because customers use our businesses\u2019 services to manage important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our cloud-based solutions could adversely impact the businesses of our customers. If there are any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our businesses\u2019 services, customers could elect not to renew or delay or withhold payment, we could lose future sales, or customers could make warranty claims against our businesses, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable, or costly litigation or the payment of damages. As a result, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nFolioDynamix could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage as a result of operational errors, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\nFolioDynamix faces operational risk related to improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in its operating systems, business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in its internal control processes; these operational errors could be magnified by market volatility. FolioDynamix relies on its employees and systems to process large volumes of transactions. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems, human error or improper action by employees, we could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business\nClaims that we or our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party may require us to incur significant costs, enter into royalty or licensing agreements or develop or license substitute technology.\nOur businesses may be subject to claims that the technologies in their products and services infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party. In addition, the vendors providing our businesses with technology for use in their technology could become subject to similar infringement claims. Although we believe that our businesses\u2019 software and services do not infringe any intellectual property or other proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that such software and services do not, or that they will not in the future, infringe intellectual property or other proprietary rights held by others. Any claims of infringement could cause our businesses to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is without merit, and could\ndistract management from their business. Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from the claim could require our businesses to pay substantial amounts, or obtain a license to continue to use the software and services that are the subject of the claim, and/or otherwise restrict or prohibit our businesses\u2019 use of the technology. There can be no assurance that our businesses would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms from the third party asserting any particular claim, or that they would be able to successfully develop alternative technology on a timely basis, or that they would be able to obtain a license from another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit them to continue offering, and their customers to continue using, the products and services. In addition, our businesses generally provide in their customer agreements for certain products and services that they will indemnify their customers against third-party infringement claims relating to technology they provide to those customers, which could obligate our businesses to pay damages if the products and services were found to be infringing. Infringement claims asserted against our businesses, our vendors or our businesses\u2019 customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our products have been developed using open source software. If we fail to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses, our business could be negatively affected.\nSome of our products include software covered by open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts; there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our products. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the relevant portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and services. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software; these usage risks could negatively affect our business.\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our products; the inability to maintain licenses for this software could result in increased cost, which could have a negative effect on our business.\nOur products incorporate certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software and development tools from third parties; however, if we had to find alternatives to our existing third-party licenses, it could increase our costs and have a negative effect on our business.\nOur business strategy, which calls for the ownership and operation of a concentrated group of vertically-focused, majority-owned cloud-based businesses, may subject us to additional risks.\nIn recent years, we have disposed of our interests in a number of businesses, including Procurian, Inc. (\u201cProcurian\u201d), which historically accounted for a significant amount of our revenue and earnings. We have opted to focus our human and financial capital on a smaller number of majority-owned businesses and currently operate four majority-owned businesses, each of which offers cloud-based software and services to serve the needs of a particular vertical industry. Because we have reduced the extent to which our holdings are diversified, we have concentrated the risk on our four majority-owned businesses. As a vertically-focused company, we also face concentrated risk relative to four industries. Unlike horizontally-focused companies with which we complete, our success is in part dependent upon the wellbeing of the four industries that our businesses serve. As a result, the occurrence of a material adverse event or existence of a material adverse condition at any one of our four majority-owned businesses or a downturn in one of the vertical markets that they serve could have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, it could negatively affect our results of operations and our financial condition in a material way.\nOur businesses may not be able to attract customers due to a variety of reasons, including increased competition, the unwillingness of potential customers to shift to cloud-based processes or spend money on non-core products and services, especially during periods of economic uncertainty, customer insolvency and the unavailability of credit for customers. If our businesses are unable to attract new customers, our results of operations and our financial condition could be negatively affected in a material way.\nPotential customers may be unwilling to implement the business changes attendant to the use of some of our cloud-based software and services.\nThe use of our cloud-based software and services often requires customers to implement changes to their existing business\nprocess or to adapt new business processes with which they are unfamiliar. Some of our potential customers may continue to rely on existing internal solutions or other non-cloud-based solutions rather than implement the business changes called for by our solutions.\nThe development of in-house capabilities by our customers may have a negative effect on our financial performance.\nSome of our businesses\u2019 customers have developed or may develop capabilities in-house for portions of solutions that are similar to those that our businesses offer. Those customers may choose not to purchase our products and services and may compete with us directly, which could have a negative effect on our financial performance.\nIf our customers, including certain significant customers, do not renew their contracts for our products or if they do not renew them on terms that are favorable to us, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe try to enter into multi-year contracts with our customers; however, GovDelivery\u2019s federal government contracts are generally limited to one-year terms and our other businesses face competitive pressure to agree to terms of not more than one year. As our customer contracts approach the end of their terms, we seek to renew the agreements. Historically, renewals have represented a significant portion of our total revenue and, accordingly, our historical growth rates have been dependent upon high renewal rates. Because of this characteristic of our business, if our customers, particularly our significant customers, choose not to renew their contracts on beneficial terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our products and services, the availability of alternative products and services offered by our competitors and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels.\nIf our businesses\u2019 research and development efforts are not successful, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nIn order to remain competitive and drive organic revenue growth, our businesses deploy a significant amount of capital, both financial and human, towards research and development efforts aimed at developing innovative new products that they believe will be attractive to their existing and potential customers. If our businesses are unable to develop innovative and competitive products that customers are interested in purchasing, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nIf we are unable to develop and upsell additional or enhanced products and services to our existing customers, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur future success depends in part on our businesses\u2019 ability to develop and sell additional or enhanced products and services to their existing current customers. The rate at which our businesses\u2019 customers purchase additional or enhanced products and services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, their satisfaction with the products and services that they have already purchased and our ability to cross sell products offered by companies that our businesses acquire as tuck-in acquisitions. If our businesses\u2019 efforts to upsell to existing customers are not successful, our results of operations may be negatively affected.\nThe loss of or reduction in business from one or more significant customers could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nMost of our businesses have significant individual customer relationships. Notably, Bolt has relationships with sizeable insurance carriers, FolioDynamix has relationships with large financial institutions (one of which ceased being a customer of FolioDynamix in 2015) and GovDelivery has relationships with significant government entities. A substantial portion of each of these businesses\u2019 revenues is tied to a relatively small number of customers. For example, FolioDynamix\u2019s five largest customers in terms of revenue generation represented approximately 57% of its revenue in 2015. If our businesses are unable to retain one or more significant customers, or if their customers collectively reduce by a significant amount the products or services that they purchase from our businesses, or if our businesses fail to secure additional significant customers, we could fail to achieve our internal financial forecasts and related revenue and earnings guidance, and our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nSome of our businesses incur significant expenses in connection with long selling cycles and/or implementation cycles, which may take time to recover or will not be recovered if they are unsuccessful in securing new customer contracts.\nOur businesses, particularly Bolt, FolioDynamix and GovDelivery, face long selling cycles and/or implementation cycles in connection with securing new contracts from large enterprise customers, and they may incur significant expenses during the selling\ncycle and/or implementation cycles. Our businesses may not succeed in securing contractual relationships with prospective clients, in which case they would receive no revenues or reimbursement for those expenses and, even if they do secure new clients, they may incur significant implementation costs that take time to recover. The incurrence of such costs and the delay or inability to recover them could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs more of our businesses\u2019 sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, we face less predictability, great pricing pressure and increased implementation and customization challenges, all of which could materially harm our business and our operating results.\nAs our businesses target more of their sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we face less predictability in completing some of our sales. A potential customer\u2019s decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision such that we would need to provide greater education regarding the use and benefits of our service. Additionally, large customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, sales opportunities with large enterprise customers are difficult to forecast and may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers. This increases the cost and time required to complete sales. As a result of these risks, our business and operating results could be materially negatively impacted.\nSome of our businesses\u2019 long selling and implementation cycles make it difficult for us to prepare internal financial forecasts.\nLong and varying selling and implementation cycles for our businesses, particularly Bolt, may make it difficult for us to accurately predict whether and when prospective customers will enter into contracts to purchase products or services and when our businesses will recognize revenue from those contracts. As a result, it is difficult for us to create precise internal financial forecasts, our actual results may vary from our internal financial forecasts, and our operating results in future reporting periods may be significantly below the expectations of the public market, securities analysts or investors.\nBecause we recognize subscription revenue from our customers over the terms of their agreements, downturns or upturns in bookings may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe recognize subscription revenue over the terms of our businesses\u2019 customer agreements, with some of our agreements being multi-year contracts. As a result, most of our quarterly subscription revenue results from agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a shortfall in demand for our software and related services in any quarter may not significantly reduce our revenue for that quarter, but could negatively affect revenue in future quarters. We may not be able to adjust our cost structure to compensate for this potential shortfall in revenue. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales of subscriptions to our businesses\u2019 software and related services may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase revenue through additional sales in any period, as subscription and related revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable terms.\nOur focus on vertical cloud solutions may make it more difficult for us to obtain customers and compete with providers of horizontal cloud solutions.\nWe serve vertical markets where we believe our cloud-based solutions can create unique and compelling value for customers. Although our focus on vertical markets is an important factor that differentiates us from our competitors, the narrow focus of our offerings could make it more difficult for us to compete with providers of horizontal cloud solutions, which, due to their focus on multiple markets, may be larger, better-capitalized and better known.\nIf our businesses do not execute the conversions of new clients onto their platforms in a timely and accurate manner, it could have a material adverse effect of our results of operations, financial condition or business.\nWhen FolioDynamix enters into an arrangement with a new client, it typically must convert such client\u2019s technology platform to the FolioDynamix technology platform. Similarly, some of Bolt\u2019s arrangements require extensive conversions. If we are not successful in executing these complex conversions in a timely and accurate manner, our businesses may lose customers or be required to devote more financial and human resources than they expected when they entered into certain arrangements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\nThe loss of key personnel, or our inability to attract additional key personnel, could result in significant business disruption and harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain exceptional key personnel. If our key personnel, particularly senior executives and individuals with vertical domain expertise, were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, or if we were unable to continue to hire exceptional personnel, our operations could be disrupted, and our operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed.\nGovDelivery depends heavily on contracts with the United States federal government. Those contracts could be materially reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the government\u2019s continuing assessment of priorities, changes in government priorities, budget cuts or changes in government personnel relating to the results of the elections or otherwise. Those matters and/or delays in the budget process could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nGovDelivery derives the majority of its revenue from U.S. federal government customers; we expect that the business will continue to derive most of its sales from work performed under U.S. government contracts, which are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may extend over many years. The programs in which GovDelivery participates must compete with other programs and policy imperatives for consideration during the budget and appropriation process. Concerns about increased deficit spending, along with continued economic challenges, continue to place pressure on U.S. and international government-customer budgets. While we believe that GovDelivery\u2019s programs are well aligned with the missions of our U.S. government customers, shifts in domestic spending, the affordability of GovDelivery\u2019s products and services, general economic conditions and developments, and other factors may affect a decision to fund, or the level of funding, for existing or proposed contracts between GovDelivery and its U.S. federal government customers. In addition, changes in personnel at either the legislative or executive branch of the U.S. federal government, whether relating to the results of elections, such as the upcoming 2016 presidential election, or otherwise, could lead to a change in approach, priorities or funding at the U.S. federal government level that could cause a material reduction, non-renewal or cancellation of one or more of GovDelivery\u2019s federal government contracts.\nWe and our businesses may be subject to government regulation that could disrupt and harm our businesses.\nThe cloud-based offerings of our businesses are subject to government regulation domestically and internationally in many areas, including regulation of the Internet regarding user privacy, telecommunications, data protection and on-line content. Regulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. The application of those laws and regulations to our businesses is often unclear, and sometimes the laws and regulations may conflict. Compliance with those laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue. Additionally, some of the vertical markets in which we operate are heavily regulated. For example, Bolt is subject to state regulation respect with to its insurance operations and FolioDynamix is subject to federal regulation covering the financial services industry, including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the \u201cAdvisers Act\u201d). Noncompliance by our businesses with applicable regulations could result in monetary penalties being imposed on our businesses or orders that our businesses cease performing a critical activity, such as selling their software and services or, in the case of Bolt, providing insurance services, and in the case of FolioDynamix, providing financial services.\nFolioDynamix\u2019s advisory services business is subject to extensive government regulation and compliance failures or regulatory action against FolioDynamix could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or business.\nThe financial services industry in which FolioDynamix operates is extensively regulated. FDx Advisors, a subsidiary of FolioDynamix, is registered as an \u201cinvestment advisor\u201d with the SEC under the Advisers Act and is regulated thereunder. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations and restrictions on investment advisers. The laws and regulations to which FolioDynamix is subject are complex and are subject to change in the future. If FolioDynamix fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could be subject to fines and sanctions, including a revocation of its registration as an investment adviser, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\nFolioDynamix is subject to liability for losses that result from a breach of its fiduciary duties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\nFolioDynamix\u2019s investment advisory services involve fiduciary obligations that require it to act in the best interests of its clients, and it may be sued and face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of its fiduciary duties. Because FolioDynamix provides investment advisory services, both directly and indirectly, with respect to substantial assets, it could face substantial liability to its clients if it is determined that it has breached its fiduciary duties. In certain circumstances, FolioDynamix may enter into client agreements jointly with advisors and retain third-party investment money managers on behalf of clients. As a result, it may be included as a defendant in lawsuits against financial advisors and third-party investment money managers that involve claims of\nbreaches of the duties of such persons, and may face liabilities for the improper actions and/or omissions of such advisors and third-party investment money managers. In addition, FolioDynamix may face claims based on the results of its investment advisory recommendations, even in the absence of a breach of its fiduciary duty. Such claims and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business.\nVelocityEHS provides its customers with cloud-based software to help them comply with federal employee health and safety regulations. If the federal government were to reduce the amount of, or otherwise significantly alter, regulations related to employee health and safety, it could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nVelocityEHS provides cloud-based software that helps employers comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) regulations related to employee health and safety. If the scope of OSHA\u2019s regulation of employee health and safety were to decline, or if OSHA were to reduce its enforcement efforts (whether as a result of changes in U.S. federal government personnel relating to the results of elections or otherwise), VelocityEHS\u2019s customers and potential customers would be less likely to purchase VelocityEHS\u2019s products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nCustomers of VelocityEHS could purchase fewer or no products or services once they meet an upcoming regulatory compliance deadline, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCustomers purchase some of VelocityEHS\u2019s products and services in order to comply with federal regulations associated with the Globally Harmonized System of the Classification and Labeling of Chemicals that require standardization of safety data sheets and related training (the \u201cGHS Standards\u201d). U.S. companies subject to the GHS standards must achieve full compliance by June 1, 2016. Customers have purchased and may purchase VelocityEHS\u2019s safety data sheet authoring and training services in order to achieve compliance with the GHS Standards. Once such compliance is achieved, these companies may purchase fewer or none of VelocityEHS\u2019s products and services. As a result, VelocityEHS\u2019s revenues associated with certain of its products and services could materially decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.\nRevenue from FolioDynamix\u2019s advisory service fees could materially decrease as a result of an economic downturn or negative market conditions.\nSome of the fees from FolioDynamix\u2019s advisory services business are based on the amount of assets under management and other advisory fees are based on the number of accounts managed. If the value of the assets under FolioDynamix\u2019s management and/or the number of accounts managed by FolioDynamix decreases significantly due to an economic downturn or negative market conditions, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nBolt derives a meaningful portion of its revenue from commissions, which are dependent on premium rates charged by a limited number of insurance companies that can be difficult to predict.\nIn addition to its cloud software business, Bolt is engaged in commercial and personal property and casualty insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, and programs businesses, and, as such, derives a meaningful portion of its revenue from commissions paid by a limited number of insurance companies. Commissions are based upon a percentage of premiums paid by customers for insurance products. The amount of such commissions is therefore highly dependent on premium rates charged by a limited number of insurance companies. Bolt does not determine insurance premiums. Premium rates are determined by insurance companies based on a fluctuating market. Historically, property and casualty premiums have been cyclical in nature and have varied widely based on market conditions.\nAs traditional risk-bearing commercial and personal property and casualty insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as Bolt, those insurance companies may seek to further reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to such insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may adversely affect Bolt\u2019s profitability and financial condition. Because Bolt does not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it may not be able to accurately forecast its commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline.\nBecause Bolt competes with certain of its customers and potential customers with respect to its provision of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products and services, such customers and potential customers may be unwilling to enter into contracts with Bolt, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBolt provides a cloud-based platform used by commercial and personal property and casualty insurance carriers, insurance agents and consumers. Some of Bolt\u2019s offerings may compete with offerings of insurance carriers that are existing customers or potential\ncustomers, and these insurance carriers could decide not to use the Bolt platform, which could affect Bolt\u2019s ability to execute on its strategy and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur businesses are experiencing relatively rapid growth in their operations. If we fail to effectively manage that growth, our businesses and operating results could be harmed.\nAs a general matter, our businesses have experienced and are expected to continue to experience relatively rapid growth in terms of headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our and our businesses\u2019 combined management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we and our businesses do not effectively manage that growth, the quality of our businesses\u2019 cloud-based software and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our brands and operating results. The potential expansion of some of our businesses into international markets would heighten those risks as a result of the particular challenges of supporting businesses in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute resolution systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures, including a potential need for access to additional data centers. To effectively manage growth, we and our businesses will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management processes. Those systems enhancements and improvements may require additional capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement those improvements could hurt our ability to manage the growth of our businesses and our financial position.\nIf we experience lower growth rates than we anticipate and we fail to lower our expenses accordingly, it could have a significant material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. Our cost structure, which currently provides for significant investment in sales and marketing, product development and personnel, is based on forecasted rates of growth. We may not be able to reduce our spending in a timely or appropriate manner if our revenue does not increase in accordance with our forecasts, which could have a significant material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nFluctuations in our quarterly results and our inability to meet financial guidance may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur investors are increasingly evaluating our company based on our quarterly performance against stated financial targets. If our operating results in one or more quarters do not meet our stated financial guidance or our securities analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations, the price of our stock could decrease.\nWe expect that our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly due to many factors, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, including economic downturns or uncertainty;\n\u2022\nthe timing of customer signings and implementations at our businesses;\n\u2022\nthe pace of development or a decline in growth of cloud-based software and services markets;\n\u2022\ncompetition for the products and services offered by our businesses.\n\u2022\nour acquisition of interests in new businesses;\n\u2022\nthe operating results, including growth rates, of our businesses;\n\u2022\nchanges in our estimated quarterly revenue, earnings, cash flow and other performance metrics; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the accounting methods that we use to account for our interests in businesses that may result from changes in our ownership percentages in those businesses.\nIf we are not able to consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur business strategy of owning and operating majority-owned, cloud-based technology software and services businesses in various vertical markets may, from time to time, require: (1) the ability to strategically acquire new businesses on favorable terms and (2) the ability to strategically consummate \u201ctuck-in\u201d acquisitions at our existing businesses on favorable terms. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates that fit our business strategies. Furthermore, even if we are able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, it may not be possible or prudent to acquire interests in certain of those companies because of the relatively robust valuations being ascribed to private cloud-based software businesses at the present time, or due to competition from other potential acquirers that may have greater resources, brand name recognition, industry contacts or flexibility of structure than we do. If we are unable to effectively acquire companies on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute on our strategy, and our business may be adversely impacted.\nAcquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our business growth strategies, our existing businesses have acquired, and may continue to acquire, other companies, businesses and technologies. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology involves numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, administrative systems, technologies, services and products of the acquired company or business and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular acquisition transaction, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of additional indebtedness and other expenses for our businesses. Accordingly, difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nEntering new vertical markets through acquisitions could adversely affect our operating results.\nOver the long term, we intend to acquire businesses in new vertical markets that we believe can be transformed through the adoption of cloud-based technologies. If the vertical markets that we ultimately enter are not receptive to cloud-based solutions or potential customers in such markets choose to adopt solutions provided by our competitors, including providers of horizontal-based solutions, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe may make acquisitions that do not meet our financial or strategic expectations, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face competition for potential acquisition targets and may need to pay purchase prices reflective of high valuations to acquire attractive cloud-based technology companies. Such acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of debt and could fail to meet our financial or strategic expectations and/or to justify such valuations, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur consummation of acquisitions could have negative accounting consequences.\nA significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If we consummate acquisitions that do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations. As of December 31 2015, Actua determined that the goodwill associated with the FolioDynamix business that was acquired in November of 2014 was partially impaired and recognized an impairment charge of 39.7 million.\nIf we are unable to remediate our existing material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Identification of one or more material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting results in a determination that internal control over financial reporting is not effective.\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, our management and independent registered public accounting firm identified control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting relating to, among other things, the control environment at Bolt that constitute material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address these material weaknesses. Both the material weaknesses and our remediation plan are detailed in \u201cItem 9A - Controls and Procedures\u201d in this Report. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing or implementing these measures or that these measures will significantly improve or remediate the material weaknesses, including those relating to Bolt\u2019s control environment, in a timely manner, or at\nall. If we fail to remediate the material weaknesses, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within the timeframes required by law or stock exchange regulations. There is no assurance that we have identified all of our material weaknesses, or that in the future, additional material weaknesses will not exist or otherwise be discovered. If our efforts to remediate the material weaknesses identified are not successful, or if other material weaknesses or other deficiencies occur, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position could be impaired, which could result in late filings of our annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of our consolidated financial statements, a decline in our stock price, sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities or suspension or delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ.\nThe operations and growth of Actua and/or our businesses could be impaired by the inability to raise capital or borrow money on favorable terms.\nThe operations and growth (both organic and acquisitions-based) of Actua and/or our businesses may require additional capital. If we or our businesses are unable to raise capital or obtain credit on favorable terms, the ability of our businesses to operate and grow may be impaired. This may require us to take other actions, such as borrowing money on terms that may be unfavorable, or divesting of assets prematurely to raise capital. If we need capital for our businesses and are unable to raise it, our businesses may need to limit or cease operations.\nExecution of our acquisitions strategy may result in a depletion of our cash.\nOur strategy may, from time to time, call for us to acquire new cloud-based software and services businesses and technologies. Acquiring a controlling equity stake in a cloud-based software or services company with the strong financial characteristics and growth potential necessitated by our strategy would likely require a significant amount of capital. Deploying large amounts of capital to acquire one or more companies could lead to a depletion of our available cash and could require us to borrow money, issue stock or otherwise raise additional capital, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all.\nOwnership in our consolidated businesses by such businesses\u2019 management teams could negatively impact our ability to execute our strategy if our interests are not aligned with management.\nOne aim of our business strategy is to maintain significant majority ownership positions in our most promising and mature businesses, ideally owning such businesses solely with those businesses\u2019 management teams. Because we believe that it is important that the key managers of our businesses own stakes in those businesses, when we acquire a new consolidated business we typically encourage its key managers to retain an equity interest in the surviving business. Additionally, each of our consolidated businesses maintains equity incentive plans for its employees. We seek to align our interests with management of our businesses through equity ownership and believe that, particularly when management holds the same security as us, such alignment is likely. The ownership of equity interests by company managers who have different financial and strategic goals or hold different securities than us, however, could have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business strategy.\nMinority stockholders of our consolidated businesses could attempt to limit our ability to control our businesses, which could have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business strategy.\nManagement of our consolidated businesses, and in the case of Bolt, other minority stockholders of Bolt, could have financial or business interests or objectives that are different from ours and could seek to limit our ability to control our actions with respect that business, particularly in connection with capital-raising activities or other significant transactions, which could have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business strategy.\nIf we cannot, or choose not to, extract cash from our businesses, it could have a negative impact on our liquidity position and operations.\nOne of our goals is to help our businesses achieve profitability so that we can access their cash flow. All of our businesses may not meet that goal; even if they do, in lieu of issuing dividends, we may choose to reinvest cash in our businesses\u2019 for operations, including for investment in product development, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and tuck-in acquisitions. It is our current intention to retain any earnings to fund growth in our businesses and to acquire new businesses and technologies. If we do not access cash from our businesses, it could have a negative impact on our future liquidity position and operations.\nOur accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis in our businesses could change materially in the near term, particularly in light of current stock market conditions.\nOur accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis, including goodwill, in our businesses have changed and could change in the near term, and the effect of those changes on our consolidated financial statements could be significant. As of December 31, 2014, the closing price of our common stock ($18.47 per share) exceeded the book value of our assets ($11.08 per share). As of December 31, 2015, the closing price of our common stock ($11.45 per share) exceeded the book value of our assets ($8.78 per share). Market multiples of companies in the SAAS industry have decreased significantly since December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that the goodwill associated with FolioDynamix was partially impaired and recognized a loss of $39.7 million. Because the relationship between our book value, the market price of our common stock and the fair value of our businesses factor into our impairment analysis, if there is a significant difference between our book value and market price in the future, our fair value accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis, including goodwill, in one or more of our businesses could result in additional impairments. It is possible that a significant write-down or write-off of our carrying basis in our businesses, including goodwill, may be required in the future, or that a significant loss will be recorded in the future upon the sale of one or more businesses, including due to declines in the price of our stock or decreases in the market multiples attributed to companies in the SAAS industry. The $39.7 million impairment associated with FolioDynamix or any future write-downs, or any write-offs of this type, which could increasingly occur during periods of market down turn, such as the current one, could cause a decline in the price of our stock.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nFinancial accounting standards may change or their interpretation may change. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change becomes effective. Changes to existing rules or the re-examining of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nNumerous external forces, including generally weak and/or uncertain economic and political conditions, could result in declines in our revenue and operating results.\nNumerous external forces beyond our control, including generally weak and/or uncertain economic and political conditions, could result in future declines in our revenue and operating results. Adverse or uncertain financial and political conditions could cause customers and potential customers of our businesses to forgo, delay or reduce the amount of cloud-based software and services that they purchase, extend our business sales cycles, create difficulties in collecting (or the inability to collect) accounts receivable, lead to slower adoption of new technologies, result in increased price competition and/or make it difficult or impossible for our businesses to obtain financing.\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile in the future.\nOur stock price has historically had a higher than average volatility. This volatility may continue in the future, particularly in light of the uncertainty that has characterized the global economy in recent years.\nThe following factors, among others, may add to the volatility in the price of our stock:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, including economic downturns or uncertainty;\n\u2022\nthe reluctance of potential customers to use cloud-based solutions or spend on non-core products and services;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of our businesses and other private and public cloud-based technology businesses;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends related to cloud-based technology businesses;\n\u2022\nchanges by securities analysts regarding their expectations of our performance;\n\u2022\nnew products or services offered by our businesses and their competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our businesses or their competitors of technological innovations;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, our businesses or our businesses\u2019 competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures;\n\u2022\nadditional sales or repurchases of our securities or the securities of our businesses; and\n\u2022\nadditions to or departures of our key personnel.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Any of these factors may decrease the price of our stock.\nWe have had a general history of operating losses and may experience operating losses in the future.\nHistorically we have had significant operating losses, excluding the effect of any non-operating gains, such as from the sale of interests in our businesses. Although some of our businesses are expected to generate positive operating cash flows in the near term, we can provide no assurance that any of our businesses, or our businesses as a collective group, will achieve and/or sustain profitability for any period of time.\nOur businesses have relatively limited operating histories and may never be profitable.\nOur businesses have relatively limited operating histories to aid in assessing future prospects. Further, some of our businesses have significant historical losses and may not be profitable in the relatively near future. Our businesses have incurred substantial costs to develop and market their products and expand operations and have incurred net losses; we intend to continue to spend substantial amounts on product development and sales and marketing for our business. The operating expenses of these businesses could increase in the foreseeable future as they continue to develop products, increase sales and marketing efforts and expand operations, and there can be no assurance that such increased expenses will ultimately result in increased revenues.\nWe may be unable to obtain maximum value in connection with the divestiture of businesses or other assets.\nFrom time to time, we may divest interests in our businesses or other assets to generate cash or for strategic reasons. The timing of such divestitures, particularly with respect to our businesses, may not be within our control. If we need to divest interests in our businesses quickly to satisfy immediate cash requirements or for other strategic reasons, we may sell our assets prior to canvassing the market or at a time when market conditions valuations are unfavorable. We also may not be able to identify buyers for certain of our assets, particularly given the difficulty that potential acquirers may currently face in obtaining financing. Furthermore, in connection with the sale of a private company, we may not receive the full amount of proceeds to which we would otherwise be entitled under that company\u2019s certificate of incorporation if additional payments to management and/or other stockholders are made to secure the approval and/or execution of the sale. In times of economic uncertainty, a greater percentage of consideration in acquisition transactions tends to consist of earn-outs, hold-backs, escrows and other contingent consideration, some of which may never be realized by a seller. We may be unable to sell any interests we may have in publicly-traded companies at then-quoted market prices, if at all, because low trading volumes of those companies may limit our ability to sell a significant amount of the companies\u2019 stock in the open market. Registration and other requirements under applicable securities laws may also adversely affect our ability to dispose of our interests on a timely basis. Based on the foregoing factors, when we divest of an interest in a business or another asset, such as a marketable security, we may not receive maximum value for that asset and the realizable value of our interest in such asset may ultimately be lower than the carrying value currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements and/or the expectations our investors or securities analysts.\nWe and our businesses may be subject to litigation proceedings that could disrupt and harm our businesses.\nWe and our businesses may be subject to legal claims involving stockholder, consumer, competition and other matters. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting one or more of our businesses from performing a critical activity, such as selling its software and services. If we or one of our businesses were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a litigation matter, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. Even if legal claims brought against us or our businesses are without merit, defending lawsuits could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert our or our businesses\u2019 management attention from other business concerns.\nWe have implemented certain anti-takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our amended certificate of incorporation and bylaws, including super majority voting requirements and the inability of our stockholders to call stockholder meetings or act by written consent, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our amended certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and also provides for a staggered board of directors. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders. The combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination.", "PERMNO": 87167, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "ACTA"}
