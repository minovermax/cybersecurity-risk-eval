{"cik": "1385818", "company": "AYTU BIOSCIENCE, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities includes a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the specific factors discussed below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the market price of our securities to decline and could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern and may do so again in the future.\nIn their report accompanying our audited financial statements, our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities or through bank financing. We believe our entry into the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which, if we meet the conditions, we can require Lincoln Park to purchase up to $10.0 million of our common stock, can provide us with available capital, provided we can meet those conditions, of which there can be no assurance. However, our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on our ability to obtain additional financing. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. If adequate financing is not available, we would be required to terminate or significantly curtail our operations, or enter into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain aspects of our products or product candidates, or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish. If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would be jeopardized and we may not be able to continue operations.\nWe have a limited operating history, have incurred losses, and can give no assurance of profitability.\nWe are a commercial-stage healthcare company with a limited operating history. Prior to implementing our commercial strategy in the fourth calendar quarter of 2015, we did not have a focus on profitability. As a result, we have not generated substantial revenue to date and are not profitable, and have incurred losses in each year since our inception. Our net loss for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $28.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively. We have not demonstrated the ability to be a profit-generating enterprise to date, and without significant financing, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate significant revenue is uncertain, and we may never achieve profitability. We have a very limited operating history on which investors can evaluate our potential for future success. Potential investors should evaluate us in light of the expenses, delays, uncertainties, and complications typically encountered by early-stage healthcare businesses, many of which will be beyond our control. These risks include the following:\n\u00b7 uncertain market acceptance of our products and product candidates;\n\u00b7 U.S. regulatory approval of our products and product candidates;\n\u00b7 foreign regulatory approval of our products and product candidates;\n\u00b7 lack of sufficient capital;\n\u00b7 unanticipated problems, delays, and expense relating to product development and implementation;\n\u00b7 lack of sufficient intellectual property;\n\u00b7 competition; and\n\u00b7 technological changes.\nAs a result of our limited operating history, and the increasingly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete, our historical financial data, which, prior to April 16, 2015, consists of allocations of expenses from Ampio, is of limited value in anticipating future operating expenses. Our planned expense levels will be based in part on our expectations concerning future operations, which is difficult to forecast accurately based on our limited operating history and the recentness of the acquisition of our products ProstaScint, Primsol and Natesto. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected budgetary shortfall.\nWe have not received any substantial revenues from the commercialization of our current products to date and might not receive significant revenues from the commercialization of our current products or our product candidates in the near term. Even though ProstaScint and Primsol are each an approved drug that we are marketing, we only acquired ProstaScint in May 2015 and Primsol in October 2015 and have limited experience on which to base the revenue we could expect to receive from their sales. We acquired Natesto in April 2016 and launched it in July 2016 and consequently have no meaningful experience on which to base expected revenue from Natesto. To obtain revenues from our products and product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with others, in a range of challenging activities, including expanding markets for our existing products and completing clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining positive results from those clinical trials, achieving marketing approval for those product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling our existing products and those products for which we, or our collaborators, may obtain marketing approval, satisfying any post-marketing requirements and obtaining reimbursement for our products from private insurance or government payors. We, and our collaborators, if any, may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, or one of our collaborators does, we may never generate revenues that are sufficient enough for us to achieve profitability.\nWe will need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product expansion and development efforts or other operations.\nWe are expending resources to expand the market for Natesto, ProstaScint and Primsol, none of which might be as successful as we anticipate or at all and all of which might take longer and be more expensive than we anticipate. We also are currently advancing our product candidates through clinical development. Developing product candidates is expensive, lengthy and risky, and we expect to incur research and development expenses in connection with our ongoing clinical development activities with the MiOXSYS System. We also will need additional capital to uplist our common stock to the NYSE MKT or the NASDAQ Capital Market. As of June 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were $8.1 million available to fund our operations offset by an aggregate $8.9 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the Natesto payable. In May 2016, we conducted a public offering of our common stock and warrants from which we received net proceeds of approximately $6.3 million. Our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we will require additional capital to continue the expansion of marketing efforts for Natesto, ProstaScint and Primsol and to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our current product candidate, the MiOXSYS System. Raising funds in the current economic environment, as well our lack of operating history, may present additional challenges. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations. We intend to rely on the purchase agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) we entered into with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC in July 2016 for our capital needs, including further commercialization of our currently approved products. If we were unable to access a portion or the full amount of the Purchase Agreement, in the absence of any other financing sources, it would have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nAny additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to expand any existing product or develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be unable to expand the market for Natesto, ProstaScint or Primsol and/or be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of our current product candidate, the MiOXSYS system, or any future product candidate or expand our operations generally or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to successfully expand the commercialization of Natesto, ProstaScint and Primsol and to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize, our current product candidate, the MiOXSYS System.\nThe expansion of marketing and commercialization activities for our existing products and the development of pharmaceutical products, medical diagnostics and medical devices is capital-intensive. We anticipate we may require additional financing to continue to fund our operations. Our future capital requirements will depend on, and could increase significantly as a result of, many factors including:\n\u00b7 the costs, progress and timing of our efforts to expand the marketing of Natesto, ProstaScint and Primsol;\n\u00b7 progress in, and the costs of, our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and other research and development programs;\n\u00b7 the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for commercial production;\n\u00b7 the scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs;\n\u00b7 the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements we obtain;\n\u00b7 the costs of establishing, expanding or contracting for sales and marketing capabilities for any existing products and if we obtain regulatory clearances to market our current product candidate, the MiOXSYS system;\n\u00b7 the extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under future collaboration agreements, if any; and\n\u00b7 the costs involved in filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights.\nIf funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our commercialization efforts or our technologies, research or development programs.\nWe may not be able to access the full amounts available under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, which could prevent us from accessing the capital we need to continue our operations that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe intend to rely on the purchase agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) we entered into with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (\u201cLincoln Park\u201d) in July 2016 for our near-term capital needs, including further commercialization of our currently approved products. After selling $500,000 of common stock on the day we executed the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we may now direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $10,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock over a 36-month period. On any trading day selected by us, we may sell shares of common stock to Lincoln Park in amounts up to 10,000 shares per regular sale (Regular Purchases), which may be increased to up to 20,000 shares depending on certain conditions as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, up to the aggregate commitment of $10,000,000. If the market price of our common stock is not below $7.00 per share on the purchase date, then the Regular Purchase amount may be increased to 15,000 shares. If the market price is not below $9.00 per share on the purchase date, then the Regular Purchase amount may be increased to 20,000 shares. Although there are no upper limits on the per share price Lincoln Park may pay to purchase our common stock, the Company may not sell more than $500,000 in shares of common stock to Lincoln Park per any individual Regular Purchase.\nIn addition to Regular Purchases, we may in our sole discretion direct Lincoln Park on each purchase date to make \u201caccelerated purchases\u201d on the following business day up to the lesser of (i) two times the number of shares purchased pursuant to such Regular Purchase or (ii) 30% of the trading volume on the accelerated purchase date at a purchase price equal to the lesser of (i) the closing sale price on the accelerated purchase date and (ii) 95% of the accelerated purchase date\u2019s volume weighted average price. We cannot submit an accelerated purchase notice if the stock price is below $3.00.\nThe purchase price of the shares related to the Purchase Agreement will be based on the prevailing market prices of the Company\u2019s shares of common stock, which shall be equal to the lesser of the lowest sale price of the common shares during the purchase date and the average of the three lowest closing sale prices of the common shares during the ten business days prior to the purchase date without any fixed discount.\nDepending on the prevailing market price of our common stock, we may not be able to sell shares to Lincoln Park for the maximum $10,000,000 over the term of the Purchase Agreement. Our inability to access a portion or the full amount of the Purchase Agreement, in the absence of any other financing sources, would have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nOur investment in Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation could decline in value.\nOn April 28, 2016, we purchased approximately $2.0 million worth of shares of common stock of Acerus Pharmaceutics Corporation as a condition to our licensing of Natesto. The per share purchase price was Cdn.$0.207. Acerus common stock is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cASP.\u201d On August 15, 2016, the closing price per share was Cdn.$0.09. During the time that we own these shares, there can be no assurance that the value of that stock will not decline and we could lose our entire investment in that stock.\nWe will incur increased costs associated with, and our management will need to devote substantial time and effort to, compliance with public company reporting and other requirements.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as private companies during the majority of fiscal 2015. In addition, the rules and regulations of the SEC and any national securities exchange to which we may be subject in the future impose numerous requirements on public companies, including requirements relating to our corporate governance practices, with which we will need to comply. Further, we will continue to be required to, among other things, file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. Based on currently available information and assumptions, we estimate that we will incur approximately $0.5 million in expenses on an annual basis as a direct result of the requirements of being a publicly traded company. Our management and other personnel will need to devote substantial time to gaining expertise regarding operations as a public company and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and our efforts and initiatives to comply with those requirements could be expensive.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended June 30, 2016, and concluded that such control was effective (see Part II, Item 9A).\nHowever, if in the future we were to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting were not effective, we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or their effect on our operations because there is presently no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy. As a consequence, we may not be able to complete any necessary remediation process in time to meet our deadline for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Also, there can be no assurance that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls in connection with evaluating our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The presence of material weaknesses could result in financial statement errors which, in turn, could require us to restate our operating results.\nIf we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or if our independent auditors are unwilling or unable to provide us, when required, with an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, investors may lose confidence in our operating results, our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. In addition, if we are unable to meet the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain listing on a securities exchange such as the NYSE MKT or NASDAQ.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nNatesto, ProstaScint and Primsol may prove to be difficult to effectively commercialize as planned.\nVarious commercial, regulatory, and manufacturing factors may impact our ability to maintain or grow revenues from sales of Natesto, ProstaScint and Primsol. Specifically, we may encounter difficulty by virtue of:\n\u00b7 our inability to secure continuing prescribing of any of these products by current or previous users of the product;\n\u00b7 our inability to effectively transfer and scale manufacturing as needed to maintain an adequate commercial supply of these products;\n\u00b7 reimbursement and medical policy changes that may adversely affect the pricing, profitability or commercial appeal of Natesto, ProstaScint or Primsol; and\n\u00b7 our inability to effectively identify and align with commercial partners outside the United States, or the inability of those selected partners to gain the required regulatory, reimbursement, and other approvals needed to enable commercial success of ProstaScint or Primsol.\nWe have limited experience selling our current products as they have been acquired from another company or are newly approved for sale. As a result, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates.\nDespite our management\u2019s extensive experience in launching and managing commercial-stage healthcare companies, we have limited marketing, sales and distribution experience with our current products. Our ability to achieve profitability depends on attracting and retaining customers for our current products, and building brand loyalty for Natesto, ProstaScint and Primsol. To successfully perform sales, marketing, distribution and customer support functions, we will face a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to attract and retain skilled support team, marketing staff and sales force necessary to increase the market for our approved products and to maintain market acceptance for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the ability of our sales and marketing team to identify and penetrate the potential customer base; and\n\u00b7 the difficulty of establishing brand recognition and loyalty for our products.\nIn addition, we may seek to enlist one or more third parties to assist with sales, distribution and customer support globally or in certain regions of the world. If we do seek to enter into these arrangements, we may not be successful in attracting desirable sales and distribution partners, or we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. If our sales and marketing efforts, or those of any third-party sales and distribution partners, are not successful, our currently approved products may not achieve increased market acceptance and our product candidates may not gain market acceptance, which would materially impact our business and operations.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, any of our current or future product candidates.\nWe may not be able to develop our current or any future product candidates. Our product candidates will require substantial additional clinical development, testing, and regulatory approval before we are permitted to commence commercialization. The clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and, if approved, market any product candidate. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must demonstrate through pre-clinical testing and clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in each target indication. This process can take many years and may include post-marketing studies and surveillance, which will require the expenditure of substantial resources. Of the large number of drugs in development in the U.S., only a small percentage successfully completes the FDA regulatory approval process and is commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to continue to fund our development and clinical programs, we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized.\nWe are not permitted to market a product in the U.S. until we receive approval of a New Drug Application, or an NDA, for that product from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a complex, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and the FDA may delay, limit or deny approval of any product candidate for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u00b7 we may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective to the satisfaction of the FDA;\n\u00b7 the results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA for marketing approval;\n\u00b7 the FDA may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the FDA may require that we conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the FDA may not approve the formulation, labeling or specifications of any product candidate;\n\u00b7 the clinical research organizations, or CROs, that we retain to conduct our clinical trials may take actions outside of our control that materially adversely impact our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the FDA may find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials insufficient to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks, such as the risk of drug abuse by patients or the public in general;\n\u00b7 the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the FDA may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7 if an NDA, if and when submitted, is reviewed by an advisory committee, the FDA may have difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting in a timely manner or the advisory committee may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend that the FDA require, as a condition of approval, additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions;\n\u00b7 the FDA may require development of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval or post-approval;\n\u00b7 the FDA may not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract; or\n\u00b7 the FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nThese same risks apply to applicable foreign regulatory agencies from which we may seek approval for any of our product candidates.\nAny of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully market any product candidate. Moreover, because a substantial portion of our business is or may be dependent upon our product candidates, any such setback in our pursuit of initial or additional regulatory approval would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nIf we fail to successfully acquire new products, we may lose market position.\nAcquiring new products is an important factor in our planned sales growth, including products that already have been developed and found market acceptance. If we fail to identify existing or emerging consumer markets and trends and to acquire new products, we will not develop a strong revenue source to help pay for our development activities as well as possible acquisitions. This failure would delay implementation of our business plan, which could have a negative adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nIf we do not secure collaborations with strategic partners to test, commercialize and manufacture product candidates, we may not be able to successfully develop products and generate meaningful revenues.\nWe may enter into collaborations with third parties to conduct clinical testing, as well as to commercialize and manufacture our products and product candidates. If we are able to identify and reach an agreement with one or more collaborators, our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. Collaboration agreements typically call for milestone payments that depend on successful demonstration of efficacy and safety, obtaining regulatory approvals, and clinical trial results. Collaboration revenues are not guaranteed, even when efficacy and safety are demonstrated. The current economic environment may result in potential collaborators electing to reduce their external spending, which may prevent us from developing our product candidates.\nEven if we succeed in securing collaborators, the collaborators may fail to develop or effectively commercialize our products or product candidates. Collaborations involving our product candidates pose a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 collaborators may not have sufficient resources or may decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints such as budget limitations, lack of human resources, or a change in strategic focus;\n\u00b7 collaborators may believe our intellectual property is not valid or is unenforceable or the product candidate infringes on the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u00b7 collaborators may dispute their responsibility to conduct development and commercialization activities pursuant to the applicable collaboration, including the payment of related costs or the division of any revenues;\n\u00b7 collaborators may decide to pursue a competitive product developed outside of the collaboration arrangement;\n\u00b7 collaborators may not be able to obtain, or believe they cannot obtain, the necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 collaborators may delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates in favor of developing or commercializing their own or another party\u2019s product candidate; or\n\u00b7 collaborators may decide to terminate or not to renew the collaboration for these or other reasons.\nAs a result, collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of our product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. For example, our former collaborator that licensed Zertane conducted clinical trials which we believe demonstrated efficacy in treating PE, but the collaborator undertook a merger that we believe altered its strategic focus and thereafter terminated the collaboration agreement. The Merger also created a potential conflict with a principal customer of the acquired company, which sells a product to treat premature ejaculation in certain European markets.\nCollaboration agreements are generally terminable without cause on short notice. Once a collaboration agreement is signed, it may not lead to commercialization of a product candidate. We also face competition in seeking out collaborators. If we are unable to secure collaborations that achieve the collaborator\u2019s objectives and meet our expectations, we may be unable to advance our products or product candidates and may not generate meaningful revenues.\nWe or our strategic partners may choose not to continue an existing product or choose not to develop a product candidate at any time during development, which would reduce or eliminate our potential return on investment for that product.\nAt any time and for any reason, we or our strategic partners may decide to discontinue the development or commercialization of a product or product candidate. If we terminate a program in which we have invested significant resources, we will reduce the return, or not receive any return, on our investment and we will have missed the opportunity to have allocated those resources to potentially more productive uses. If one of our strategic partners terminates a program, we will not receive any future milestone payments or royalties relating to that program under our agreement with that party.\nOur pre-commercial product candidates are expected to undergo clinical trials that are time-consuming and expensive, the outcomes of which are unpredictable, and for which there is a high risk of failure. If clinical trials of our product candidates fail to satisfactorily demonstrate safety and efficacy to the FDA and other regulators, we or our collaborators may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of these product candidates.\nPre-clinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and unpredictable processes that can be subject to extensive delays. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. It may take several years to complete the pre-clinical testing and clinical development necessary to commercialize a drug or biologic, and delays or failure can occur at any stage. Interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict final results, and success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after promising results in earlier trials and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. An unfavorable outcome in one or more trials would be a major set-back for that product candidate and for us. Due to our limited financial resources, an unfavorable outcome in one or more trials may require us to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more product development programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and financial condition and on the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with clinical testing and trials, we face a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 a product candidate is ineffective, inferior to existing approved medicines, unacceptably toxic, or has unacceptable side effects;\n\u00b7 patients may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to the product candidate being tested;\n\u00b7 the results may not confirm the positive results of earlier testing or trials; and\n\u00b7 the results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate.\nIf we do not successfully complete pre-clinical and clinical development, we will be unable to market and sell products derived from our product candidates and generate revenues. Even if we do successfully complete clinical trials, those results are not necessarily predictive of results of additional trials that may be needed before an NDA may be submitted to the FDA. Although there are a large number of drugs and biologics in development in the United States and other countries, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA, even fewer are approved for commercialization, and only a small number achieve widespread physician and consumer acceptance following regulatory approval. If our clinical trials are substantially delayed or fail to prove the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates in development, we may not receive regulatory approval of any of these product candidates and our business, prospects and financial condition will be materially harmed.\nDelays, suspensions and terminations in any clinical trial we undertake could result in increased costs to us and delay or prevent our ability to generate revenues.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to design, implement and complete. Should we undertake the development of a pharmaceutical product candidate, we would expect the necessary clinical trials to take up to 24 months to complete, but the completion of trials for any product candidates may be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:\n\u00b7 demonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7 validating test methods to support quality testing of the drug substance and drug product;\n\u00b7 obtaining sufficient quantities of the drug substance or device ports;\n\u00b7 manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate;\n\u00b7 obtaining approval of an IND from the FDA;\n\u00b7 obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective clinical trial site;\n\u00b7 determining dosing and clinical design and making related adjustments; and\n\u00b7 patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical trial sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed, suspended or terminated due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 lack of effectiveness of product candidates during clinical trials;\n\u00b7 adverse events, safety issues or side effects relating to the product candidates or their formulation or design;\n\u00b7 inability to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts to continue clinical trials or development programs, which are very expensive;\n\u00b7 the need to sequence clinical trials as opposed to conducting them concomitantly in order to conserve resources;\n\u00b7 our inability to enter into collaborations relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 failure by us or our collaborators to conduct clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 our inability or the inability of our collaborators to manufacture or obtain from third parties materials sufficient for use in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7 governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines, including mandated changes in the scope or design of clinical trials or requests for supplemental information with respect to clinical trial results;\n\u00b7 failure of our collaborators to advance our product candidates through clinical development;\n\u00b7 delays in patient enrollment, variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials, and lower-than anticipated retention rates for patients in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 difficulty in patient monitoring and data collection due to failure of patients to maintain contact after treatment;\n\u00b7 a regional disturbance where we or our collaborative partners are enrolling patients in our clinical trials, such as a pandemic, terrorist activities or war, or a natural disaster; and\n\u00b7 varying interpretations of our data, and regulatory commitments and requirements by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies.\nMany of these factors may also ultimately lead to denial of an NDA for a product candidate. If we experience delay, suspensions or terminations in a clinical trial, the commercial prospects for the related product candidate will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.\nIn addition, we may encounter delays or product candidate rejections based on new governmental regulations, future legislative or administrative actions, or changes in FDA policy or interpretation during the period of product development. If we obtain required regulatory approvals, such approvals may later be withdrawn. Delays or failures in obtaining regulatory approvals may result in:\n\u00b7 varying interpretations of data and commitments by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies; and\n\u00b7 diminishment of any competitive advantages that such product candidates may have or attain.\nFurthermore, if we fail to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements at any stage during this regulatory process, we may encounter or be subject to:\n\u00b7 diminishment of any competitive advantages that such product candidates may have or attain;\n\u00b7 delays or termination in clinical trials or commercialization;\n\u00b7 refusal by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies to review pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u00b7 product recalls or seizures;\n\u00b7 suspension of manufacturing;\n\u00b7 withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications; and\n\u00b7 fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecutions.\nThe medical device regulatory clearance or approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain, and the failure to obtain and maintain required clearances or approvals could prevent us from broadly commercializing the MiOXSYS System for clinical use.\nThe MiOXSYS System is subject to 510(k) clearance by the FDA prior to its marketing for commercial use in the United States, and to regulatory approvals beyond CE marking required by certain foreign governmental entities prior to its marketing outside the United States. In addition, any changes or modifications to a device that has received regulatory clearance or approval that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or would constitute a major change in its intended use, may require the submission of a new application for 510(k) clearance, pre-market approval, or foreign regulatory approvals. The 510(k) clearance and pre-market approval processes, as well as the process of obtaining foreign approvals, can be expensive, time consuming and uncertain. It generally takes from four to twelve months from submission to obtain 510(k) clearance, and from one to three years from submission to obtain pre-market approval; however, it may take longer, and 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval may never be obtained. We have limited experience in filing FDA applications for 510(k) clearance and pre-market approval. In addition, we are required to continue to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements even after obtaining clearance or approval. There can be no assurance that we will obtain or maintain any required clearance or approval on a timely basis, or at all. Any failure to obtain or any material delay in obtaining FDA clearance or any failure to maintain compliance with FDA regulatory requirements could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe approval process for pharmaceutical and medical device products outside the United States varies among countries and may limit our ability to develop, manufacture and sell our products internationally. Failure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we, and our collaborators, must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and may involve additional testing. We may conduct clinical trials for, and seek regulatory approval to market, our product candidates in countries other than the United States. Depending on the results of clinical trials and the process for obtaining regulatory approvals in other countries, we may decide to first seek regulatory approvals of a product candidate in countries other than the United States, or we may simultaneously seek regulatory approvals in the United States and other countries. If we or our collaborators seek marketing approval for a product candidate outside the United States, we will be subject to the regulatory requirements of health authorities in each country in which we seek approval. With respect to marketing authorizations in Europe, we will be required to submit a European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, which conducts a validation and scientific approval process in evaluating a product for safety and efficacy. The approval procedure varies among regions and countries and may involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval.\nObtaining regulatory approvals from health authorities in countries outside the United States is likely to subject us to all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval described above. In addition, marketing approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by the health authorities of any other country, and approval by foreign health authorities does not ensure marketing approval by the FDA.\nEven if we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products may limit how we or they market our products, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, this approval may carry conditions that limit the market for the product or put the product at a competitive disadvantage relative to alternative therapies. For instance, a regulatory approval may limit the indicated uses for which we can market a product or the patient population that may utilize the product, or may be required to carry a warning in its labeling and on its packaging. Products with boxed warnings are subject to more restrictive advertising regulations than products without such warnings. These restrictions could make it more difficult to market any product candidate effectively. Accordingly, assuming we, or our collaborators, receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we, and our collaborators expect to continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance.\nAny of our products and product candidates for which we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we, and our collaborators, may be subject to substantial penalties if we, or they, fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we, or they, experience unanticipated problems with our products following approval.\nAny of our approved products and product candidates for which we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approval, as well as the manufacturing processes, post-approval studies and measures, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such products, among other things, are or will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the FDA requirement to implement a REMS to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we, or our collaborators, do not market any of our product candidates for which we, or they, receive marketing approval for only their approved indications, we, or they, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violation of the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription drugs may lead to investigations or allegations of violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development and commercialization goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed, and our business will be harmed.\nWe sometimes estimate for planning purposes the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development objectives. These milestones may include our expectations regarding the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials, the submission of regulatory filings, or commercialization objectives. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones, such as the initiation or completion of an ongoing clinical trial, the initiation of other clinical programs, receipt of marketing approval, or a commercial launch of a product. The achievement of many of these milestones may be outside of our control. All of such milestones are based on a variety of assumptions which may cause the timing of achievement of the milestones to vary considerably from our estimates, including:\n\u00b7 our available capital resources or capital constraints we experience;\n\u00b7 the rate of progress, costs and results of our clinical trials and research and development activities, including the extent of scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and collaborators, and our ability to identify and enroll patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria;\n\u00b7 our receipt of approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies and the timing thereof;\n\u00b7 other actions, decisions or rules issued by regulators;\n\u00b7 our ability to access sufficient, reliable and affordable supplies of compounds used in the manufacture of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the efforts of our collaborators with respect to the commercialization of our products; and\n\u00b7 the securing of, costs related to, and timing issues associated with, product manufacturing as well as sales and marketing activities.\nIf we fail to achieve announced milestones in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed and our business, prospects and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis, which may result in costs and delays that prevent us from successfully commercializing product candidates.\nWe rely, and will rely in the future, on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract research organizations, contract laboratories, and collaborators to perform data collection and analysis and others to carry out our clinical trials. Our development activities or clinical trials conducted in reliance on third parties may be delayed, suspended, or terminated if:\n\u00b7 the third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or fail to meet regulatory obligations or expected deadlines;\n\u00b7 we replace a third party; or\n\u00b7 the quality or accuracy of the data obtained by third parties is compromised due to their failure to adhere to clinical protocols, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons.\nThird party performance failures may increase our development costs, delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval, and delay or prevent the commercialization of our product candidates. While we believe that there are numerous alternative sources to provide these services, in the event that we seek such alternative sources, we may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without incurring delays or additional costs.\nEven if collaborators with which we contract in the future successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates, those product candidates may not be commercialized successfully for other reasons.\nEven if we contract with collaborators that successfully complete clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates, those candidates may not be commercialized for other reasons, including:\n\u00b7 failure to receive regulatory clearances required to market them as drugs;\n\u00b7 being subject to proprietary rights held by others;\n\u00b7 being difficult or expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale;\n\u00b7 having adverse side effects that make their use less desirable; or\n\u00b7 failing to compete effectively with products or treatments commercialized by competitors.\nAny third-party manufacturers we engage are subject to various governmental regulations, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with, and experience delays in, our product commercialization as a result of these regulations.\nThe manufacturing processes and facilities of third-party manufacturers we have engaged are for our current approved products are, and any future third-party manufacturer will be, required to comply with the federal Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of devices. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. Any inspection by the FDA could lead to additional compliance requests that could cause delays in our product commercialization. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, or later discovery of previously unknown problems with the manufacturing processes and facilities of third-party manufacturers we engage, including the failure to take satisfactory corrective actions in response to an adverse QSR inspection, can result in, among other things:\n\u00b7 administrative or judicially imposed sanctions;\n\u00b7 injunctions or the imposition of civil penalties;\n\u00b7 recall or seizure of the product in question;\n\u00b7 total or partial suspension of production or distribution;\n\u00b7 the FDA\u2019s refusal to grant pending future clearance or pre-market approval;\n\u00b7 withdrawal or suspension of marketing clearances or approvals;\n\u00b7 clinical holds;\n\u00b7 warning letters;\n\u00b7 refusal to permit the export of the product in question; and\n\u00b7 criminal prosecution.\nAny of these actions, in combination or alone, could prevent us from marketing, distributing or selling our products, and would likely harm our business.\nIn addition, a product defect or regulatory violation could lead to a government-mandated or voluntary recall by us. We believe the FDA would request that we initiate a voluntary recall if a product was defective or presented a risk of injury or gross deception. Regulatory agencies in other countries have similar authority to recall drugs or devices because of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could endanger health. Any recall would divert our management attention and financial resources, expose us to product liability or other claims, and harm our reputation with customers.\nWe face substantial competition from companies with considerably more resources and experience than we have, which may result in others discovering, developing, receiving approval for, or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\nWe compete with companies that design, manufacture and market already-existing and new urology products. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies and/or our competitors improve their current products. One or more of our competitors may offer technology superior to ours and render our technology obsolete or uneconomical. Most of our current competitors, as well as many of our potential competitors, have greater name recognition, more substantial intellectual property portfolios, longer operating histories, significantly greater resources to invest in new technologies, more substantial experience in product marketing and new product development, greater regulatory expertise, more extensive manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers. If we are not able to compete successfully, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become profitable. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to:\n\u00b7 expand the market for our approved products, especially Natesto ProstaScint and Primsol;\n\u00b7 successfully commercialize our product candidates alone or with commercial partners;\n\u00b7 discover and develop product candidates that are superior to other products in the market;\n\u00b7 obtain required regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 attract and retain qualified personnel; and\n\u00b7 obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our product candidates.\nEstablished pharmaceutical companies devote significant financial resources to discovering, developing or licensing novel compounds that could make our products and product candidates obsolete. Our competitors may obtain patent protection, receive FDA approval, and commercialize medicines before us. Other companies are or may become engaged in the discovery of compounds that may compete with the product candidates we are developing.\nNatesto competes in a large, growing market. The U.S. prescription testosterone market is comprised primarily of topically applied treatments in the form of gels, solutions, and patches. Testopel\u00ae and Aveed\u00ae, injectable products typically implanted directly under the skin by a physician, are also FDA-approved. AndroGel is the market-leading TRT and is marketed by AbbVie.\nFor the MiOXSYS System and ProstaScint, we compete with companies that design, manufacture and market already existing and new in-vitro diagnostics and diagnostic imaging systems and radio-imaging agents for cancer detection. Additionally, with respect to Primsol, we compete with numerous companies who produce antimicrobial treatments for various pathogens inclusive of products containing trimethoprim as contained in Primsol.\nThere are any number of antibiotics available on the market that could compete with Primsol. Even though Primsol is the only FDA-approved liquid formulation of trimethoprim, an antibiotic that is well established in current guidelines for treating UTIs, we may not be able to effectively compete with these existing antibiotics.\nWe anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies and our competitors improve their current products. One or more of our competitors may offer technology superior to ours and render our technology obsolete or uneconomical. Most of our current competitors, as well as many of our potential competitors, have greater name recognition, more substantial intellectual property portfolios, longer operating histories, significantly greater resources to invest in new technologies, more substantial experience in new product development, greater regulatory expertise, more extensive manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers. If we are not able to compete successfully, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become profitable.\nAny new product we develop or commercialize that competes with a currently-approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and/or safety in order to address price competition and be commercially successful. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nGovernment restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenues.\nThe continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect one or more of the following:\n\u00b7 our or our collaborators\u2019 ability to set a price we believe is fair for our approved products;\n\u00b7 our ability to generate revenue from our approved products and achieve profitability; and\n\u00b7 the availability of capital.\nThe 2010 enactments of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Health Care Reconciliation Act, are expected to significantly impact the provision of, and payment for, health care in the United States. Various provisions of these laws have only recently taken effect or have yet to take effect, and are designed to expand Medicaid eligibility, subsidize insurance premiums, provide incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibit denials of coverage due to pre-existing conditions, establish health insurance exchanges, and provide additional support for medical research. Amendments to the PPACA and/or the Health Care Reconciliation Act, as well as new legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs, along with the trend toward managed healthcare in the United States, could influence the purchase of medicines and medical devices and reduce demand and prices for our products and product candidates, if approved. This could harm our or our collaborators\u2019 ability to market any approved products and generate revenues. As we expect to receive significant revenues from reimbursement of our Natesto, ProstaScint and Primsol products by commercial third-party payors and government payors, cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of further health care reform could significantly reduce potential revenues from the sale of any of our products and product candidates approved in the future, and could cause an increase in our compliance, manufacturing, or other operating expenses. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of prescription drugs and devices is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. We believe that pricing pressures at the federal and state level, as well as internationally, will continue and may increase, which may make it difficult for us to sell any approved product at a price acceptable to us or any of our future collaborators.\nIn addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug or medical device must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. A member state may require that physicians prescribe the generic version of a drug instead of our approved branded product. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products or product candidates. Historically, pharmaceutical products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to have significantly lower prices.\nOur financial results will depend on the acceptance among hospitals, third-party payors and the medical community of our products and product candidates.\nOur future success depends on the acceptance by our target customers, third-party payors and the medical community that our products and product candidates are reliable, safe and cost-effective. Many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of our products and product candidates, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to convince our potential customers of the advantages and economic value our products and product candidates over existing technologies and products;\n\u00b7 the relative convenience and ease of our products and product candidates over existing technologies and products;\n\u00b7 the introduction of new technologies and competing products that may make our products and product candidates less attractive for our target customers;\n\u00b7 our success in training medical personnel on the proper use of our products and product candidates;\n\u00b7 the willingness of third-party payors to reimburse our target customers that adopt our products and product candidates;\n\u00b7 the acceptance in the medical community of our products and product candidates;\n\u00b7 the extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts; and\n\u00b7 general economic conditions.\nIf third-party payors do not reimburse our customers for the products we sell or if reimbursement levels are set too low for us to sell one or more of our products at a profit, our ability to sell those products and our results of operations will be harmed.\nWhile Natesto, ProstaScint and Primsol are already FDA-approved and generating revenues in the U.S., they may not receive, or continue to receive, physician, hospital, or laboratory acceptance, or they may not maintain adequate reimbursement from third party payors. Additionally, even if one of our product candidates is approved and reaches the market, the product may not achieve physician, hospital, or laboratory acceptance, or it may not obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors. We expect to sell our Primsol products and possibly other product candidates to target customers substantially all of whom receive reimbursement for the health care services they provide to their patients from third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, other domestic and foreign government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Reimbursement decisions by particular third-party payors depend upon a number of factors, including each third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u00b7 a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u00b7 appropriate and medically necessary for the specific indication;\n\u00b7 cost effective; and\n\u00b7 neither experimental nor investigational.\nThird-party payors may deny reimbursement for covered products if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost-effective diagnosis methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors also may refuse to reimburse for procedures and devices deemed to be experimental.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from each government or third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our potential product to each government or third-party payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. In addition, eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be covered and reimbursed in all cases or reimbursed at a rate that allows our potential customers to make a profit or even cover their costs.\nThird-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. Levels of reimbursement may decrease in the future, and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect the demand for and reimbursement available for any product or product candidate, which in turn, could negatively impact pricing. If our customers are not adequately reimbursed for our products, they may reduce or discontinue purchases of our products, which would result in a significant shortfall in achieving revenue expectations and negatively impact our business, prospects and financial condition.\nManufacturing risks and inefficiencies may adversely affect our ability to produce our products.\nAs part of the acquisition of ProstaScint from Jazz Pharmaceuticals, we terminated the relationship with the third-party manufacturer of ProstaScint. We have initiated the process of transferring the manufacturing to Biovest International, which we believe is a qualified manufacturer and with whom we have entered into a Master Services Agreement. In the event that this manufacturing transfer does not occur by the time our current inventory expires, we may not be able to supply sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, while maintaining product quality, acceptable manufacturing costs and complying with regulatory requirements, such as quality system regulations. In addition, we expect to engage third parties to manufacture components of the MiOXSYS and RedoxSYS systems. We have an agreement for supplies of Natesto with Acerus, from whom we license Natesto, and have entered into a supply agreement for Primsol with the same manufacturer used by FSC Laboratories, from whom we purchased Primsol. For any future product, we expect to use third-party manufacturers because we do not have our own manufacturing capabilities. In determining the required quantities of any product and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates and our limited experience in marketing our current products, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of product we require. If we do not effectively maintain our supply agreements for Natesto and Primsol, we will face difficulty finding replacement suppliers, which could harm sales of those products. If we do not effectively transition sites with our manufacturing and development partners to enable to production scale of ProstaScint, or if we do not secure collaborations with manufacturing and development partners to enable production to scale of the MiOXSYS system, we may not be successful in selling ProstaScint or in commercializing the MiOXSYS system in the event we receive regulatory approval of the MiOXSYS System. If we fail in similar endeavors for future products, we may not be successful in establishing or continuing the commercialization of our products and product candidates.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured these components ourselves, including:\n\u00b7 reliance on third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u00b7 possible breaches of manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control;\n\u00b7 possible regulatory violations or manufacturing problems experienced by our suppliers; and\n\u00b7 possible termination or non-renewal of agreements by third parties, based on their own business priorities, at times that are costly or inconvenient for us.\nFurther, if we are unable to secure the needed financing to fund our internal operations, we may not have adequate resources required to effectively and rapidly transition our third party manufacturing. We may not be able to meet the demand for our products if one or more of any third-party manufacturers is unable to supply us with the necessary components that meet our specifications. It may be difficult to find alternate suppliers for any of our products or product candidates in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us.\nAny third-party manufacturers we engage are subject to various governmental regulations, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with, and experience delays in, our product commercialization as a result of these regulations.\nThe manufacturing processes and facilities of third-party manufacturers we engage are required to comply with the federal Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of devices. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. Any inspection by the FDA could lead to additional compliance requests that could cause delays in our product commercialization. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, or later discovery of previously unknown problems with the manufacturing processes and facilities of third-party manufacturers we engage, including the failure to take satisfactory corrective actions in response to an adverse QSR inspection, can result in, among other things:\n\u00b7 administrative or judicially imposed sanctions;\n\u00b7 injunctions or the imposition of civil penalties;\n\u00b7 recall or seizure of the product in question;\n\u00b7 total or partial suspension of production or distribution;\n\u00b7 the FDA\u2019s refusal to grant pending future clearance or pre-market approval;\n\u00b7 withdrawal or suspension of marketing clearances or approvals;\n\u00b7 clinical holds;\n\u00b7 warning letters;\n\u00b7 refusal to permit the export of the product in question; and\n\u00b7 criminal prosecution.\nAny of these actions, in combination or alone, could prevent us from marketing, distributing or selling our products, and would likely harm our business.\nIn addition, a product defect or regulatory violation could lead to a government-mandated or voluntary recall by us. We believe the FDA would request that we initiate a voluntary recall if a product was defective or presented a risk of injury or gross deception. Regulatory agencies in other countries have similar authority to recall drugs or devices because of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could endanger health. Any recall would divert our management attention and financial resources, expose us to product liability or other claims, and harm our reputation with customers.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to penetrate foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\nOur future profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize our products and product candidates in foreign markets for which we intend to primarily rely on collaboration with third parties. If we commercialize our products or product candidates in foreign markets, we would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7 our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties;\n\u00b7 the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements;\n\u00b7 different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;\n\u00b7 import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 longer accounts receivable collection times;\n\u00b7 longer lead times for shipping;\n\u00b7 language barriers for technical training;\n\u00b7 reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and related prevalence of generic alternatives to our products;\n\u00b7 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7 our customers\u2019 ability to obtain reimbursement for our products in foreign markets; and\n\u00b7 the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute.\nForeign sales of our products or product candidates could also be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs.\nWe are subject to various regulations pertaining to the marketing of our approved products.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on the offer of payment or acceptance of kickbacks or other remuneration for the purchase of our products, including inducements to potential patients to request our products and services. Additionally, any product promotion educational activities, support of continuing medical education programs, and other interactions with health-care professionals must be conducted in a manner consistent with the FDA regulations and the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can also carry potential federal False Claims Act liability. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors. These and any new regulations or requirements may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, may adversely impact the marketing of our existing products or delay introduction of our product candidates, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur products and product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\nFurther, if a product candidate receives marketing approval and we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by the product after the approval, or if drug abuse is determined to be a significant problem with an approved product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may withdraw or limit their approval of the product;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cBlack Box warning\u201d or a contraindication;\n\u00b7 we may be required to change the way the product is distributed or administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u00b7 we may decide to remove the product from the marketplace;\n\u00b7 we could be sued and held liable for injury caused to individuals exposed to or taking the product; and\n\u00b7 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing an affected product or product candidates and significantly impact our ability to successfully commercialize or maintain sales of our product or product candidates and generate revenues.\nNatesto contains, and future our other product candidates may contain, controlled substances, the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation, prescribing and distribution of which are subject to regulation by the DEA.\nNatesto, which is approved by the FDA, is regulated by the DEA as a Schedule III controlled substance. Before any commercialization of any product candidate that contains a controlled substance, the DEA will need to determine the controlled substance schedule, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA. This may be a lengthy process that could delay our marketing of a product candidate and could potentially diminish any regulatory exclusivity periods for which we may be eligible. Natesto is, and our other product candidates may, if approved, be regulated as \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and the implementing regulations of the DEA, which establish registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, quota and other requirements administered by the DEA. These requirements are applicable to us, to our third-party manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of our product candidates. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. A number of states and foreign countries also independently regulate these drugs as controlled substances.\nThe DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances.\nNatesto is regulated by the DEA as a Schedule III controlled substance. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, storing, selling and using of the products will be subject to a high degree of regulation. Also, distribution, prescribing and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated.\nAnnual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule.\nBecause of their restrictive nature, these laws and regulations could limit commercialization of our product candidates containing controlled substances. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could also result in withdrawal of our DEA registrations, disruption in manufacturing and distribution activities, consent decrees, criminal and civil penalties and state actions, among other consequences.\nIf testosterone replacement therapies are found, or are perceived, to create health risks, our ability to sell Natesto could be materially adversely affected and our business could be harmed.\nRecent publications have suggested potential health risks associated with testosterone replacement therapy, such as increased cardiovascular disease risk, including increased risk of heart attack or stroke, fluid retention, sleep apnea, breast tenderness or enlargement, increased red blood cells, development of clinical prostate disease, including prostate cancer, and the suppression of sperm production. Prompted by these events, the FDA held a T-class Advisory Committee meeting on September 17, 2014 to discuss this topic further. The FDA has also asked health care professionals and patients to report side effects involving prescription testosterone products to the agency.\nAt the T-class Advisory Committee meeting held on September 17, 2014, the Advisory Committee discussed (i) the identification of the appropriate patient population for whom testosterone replacement therapy should be indicated and (ii) the potential risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death associated with testosterone replacement therapy. At the meeting, the Advisory Committee voted that the FDA should require sponsors of testosterone products to conduct a post marketing study (e.g. observational study or controlled clinical trial) to further assess the potential cardiovascular risk.\nIt is possible that the FDA\u2019s evaluation of this topic and further studies on the effects of testosterone replacement therapies could demonstrate the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events or other health risks or could impose requirements that impact the marketing and sale of Natesto, including:\n\u00b7 mandate that certain warnings or precautions be included in our product labeling;\n\u00b7 require that our product carry a \u201cblack box warning\u201d; and\n\u00b7 limit use of Natesto to certain populations, such as men without specified conditions.\nDemonstrated testosterone replacement therapy safety risks, as well as negative publicity about the risks of hormone replacement therapy, including testosterone replacement, could hurt sales of and impair our ability to successfully relaunch Natesto, which could have a materially adverse impact on our business.\nFDA action regarding testosterone replacement therapies could add to the cost of producing and marketing Natesto.\nThe FDA is requiring post-marketing safety studies for all testosterone replacement therapies approved in the U.S. to assess long-term cardiovascular events related to testosterone use. Depending on the total cost and structure of the FDA\u2019s proposed safety studies there may be a substantial cost associated with conducting these studies. Pursuant to our license agreement with Acerus Pharmaceuticals is, Acerus is obligated to reimburse us for the entire cost of any studies required for Natesto by the FDA. However, in the event that Acerus is not able to reimburse us for the cost of any required safety studies, we may be forced to incur this cost, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur approved products may not be accepted by physicians, patients, or the medical community in general.\nEven if the medical community accepts a product as safe and efficacious for its indicated use, physicians may choose to restrict the use of the product if we or any collaborator is unable to demonstrate that, based on experience, clinical data, side-effect profiles and other factors, our product is preferable to any existing medicines or treatments. We cannot predict the degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products, which will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 the efficacy and safety of the product;\n\u00b7 the approved labeling for the product and any required warnings;\n\u00b7 the advantages and disadvantages of the product compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 our and any collaborator\u2019s ability to educate the medical community about the safety and effectiveness of the product;\n\u00b7 the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors pertaining to the product; and\n\u00b7 the market price of our product relative to competing treatments.\nWe may use hazardous chemicals and biological materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur research and development processes may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological materials. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed any insurance coverage and our total assets. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials and specified waste products, as well as the discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and may impair our research and development efforts. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance. In addition, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced.\nIntellectual Property Risks Related to Our Business\nOur ability to compete may decline if we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights or if we are barred by the patent rights of others.\nOur commercial success depends on obtaining and maintaining proprietary rights to our products and product candidates as well as successfully defending these rights against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our products and product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents, or effectively protected trade secrets, cover them. Our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and product candidates is uncertain due to a number of factors, including that:\n\u00b7 we may not have been the first to make the inventions covered by pending patent applications or issued patents;\n\u00b7 we may not have been the first to file patent applications for our products and product candidates;\n\u00b7 others may independently develop identical, similar or alternative products, compositions or devices and uses thereof;\n\u00b7 our disclosures in patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability;\n\u00b7 any or all of our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u00b7 we may not seek or obtain patent protection in countries that may eventually provide us a significant business opportunity;\n\u00b7 any patents issued to us may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7 our compositions, devices and methods may not be patentable;\n\u00b7 others may design around our patent claims to produce competitive products which fall outside of the scope of our patents; or\n\u00b7 others may identify prior art or other bases which could invalidate our patents.\nEven if we have or obtain patents covering our products and product candidates, we may still be barred from making, using and selling them because of the patent rights of others. Others may have filed, and in the future may file, patent applications covering products that are similar or identical to ours. There are many issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to chemical compounds, therapeutic products, diagnostic devices, and some of these relate to our products and product candidates. These could materially affect our ability to sell our products and develop our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that our products and product candidates may infringe. These patent applications may have priority over patent applications filed by us.\nObtaining and maintaining a patent portfolio entails significant expense and resources. Part of the expense includes periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications due in several stages over the lifetime of patents and/or applications, as well as the cost associated with complying with numerous procedural provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forgo patent protection or allow a patent application or patent to lapse purposefully or inadvertently, our competitive position could suffer.\nLegal actions to enforce our patent rights can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation or other actions against those that have infringed on our patents, or used them without authorization, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nPharmaceutical and medical device patents and patent applications involve highly complex legal and factual questions, which, if determined adversely to us, could negatively impact our patent position.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and medical device companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. The interpretation and breadth of claims allowed in some patents covering pharmaceutical compositions may be uncertain and difficult to determine, and are often affected materially by the facts and circumstances that pertain to the patented compositions and the related patent claims. The standards of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, are sometimes uncertain and could change in the future. Consequently, the issuance and scope of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings, and U.S. patents may be subject to re-examination proceedings, post-grant review and/or inter partes review in the USPTO. Foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office, which could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review and opposition proceedings may be costly. Accordingly, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or processes.\nIn addition, changes in or different interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign countries may permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and products and product candidates without providing any compensation to us, or may limit the number of patents or claims we can obtain. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection of our products and product candidates, we could lose our competitive advantage and competition we face would increase, reducing any potential revenues and adversely affecting our ability to attain or maintain profitability.\nDevelopments in patent law could have a negative impact on our business.\nFrom time to time, the United States Supreme Court, other federal courts, the United States Congress or the USPTO may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business.\nIn addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These changes include a transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, changes the way issued patents are challenged, and changes the way patent applications are disputed during the examination process. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have greater resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO has developed regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the America Invents Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act, and, in particular, the first-to-file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. Substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act may affect our ability to obtain patents, and if obtained, to enforce or defend them. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the America Invents Act will ultimately have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend any patents that may issue from our patent applications, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, because we operate in the highly technical field of discovery and development of therapies and medical devices, we rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We expect to enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific and commercial collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us.\nIn addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to pharmaceuticals and medical devices. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of some of our patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to inventions we develop.\nThird parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. We have or expect to have written agreements with collaborators that provide for the ownership of intellectual property arising from our collaborations. These agreements provide that we must negotiate certain commercial rights with collaborators with respect to joint inventions or inventions made by our collaborators that arise from the results of the collaboration. In some instances, there may not be adequate written provisions to address clearly the resolution of intellectual property rights that may arise from a collaboration. If we cannot successfully negotiate sufficient ownership and commercial rights to the inventions that result from our use of a third-party collaborator\u2019s materials where required, or if disputes otherwise arise with respect to the intellectual property developed with the use of a collaborator\u2019s samples, we may be limited in our ability to capitalize on the market potential of these inventions. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors, or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective, or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property, or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade secrets.\nWe might employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biopharmaceutical or medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nA dispute concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and costly, and an unfavorable outcome could harm our business.\nThere is significant litigation in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. While we are not currently subject to any pending intellectual property litigation, and are not aware of any such threatened litigation, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or product candidates infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If our development and commercialization activities are found to infringe any such patents, we may have to pay significant damages or seek licenses to such patents. A patentee could prevent us from using the patented drugs, compositions or devices. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued to us, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. From time to time, we may hire scientific personnel or consultants formerly employed by other companies involved in one or more areas similar to the activities conducted by us. Either we or these individuals may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation or other similar claims as a result of prior affiliations. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win or lose. We may not be able to afford the costs of litigation. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and stock price. Any legal action against us or our collaborators could lead to:\n\u00b7 payment of damages, potentially treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s patent rights;\n\u00b7 injunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize, and sell products; or\n\u00b7 we or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and business, prospects and financial condition. As a result, we could be prevented from commercializing our products and product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Organization, Structure and Operation\nWe intend to acquire, through asset purchases or in-licensing, businesses or products, or form strategic alliances, in the future, and we may not realize the intended benefits of such acquisitions or alliances.\nWe intend to acquire, through asset purchases or in-licensing, additional businesses or products, form strategic alliances and/or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire businesses or assets with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses or assets if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new products resulting from a strategic alliance or acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business. We cannot assure you that, following any such acquisition or alliance, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction. These risks apply to our acquisition of ProstaScint in May 2015, Primsol in October 2015 and Natesto in April 2016.\nIn fiscal 2016 and 2015, the great majority of our net revenue and gross accounts receivable were due to one significant customer, the loss of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, one customer accounted for 86% and 83%, respectively, of our net revenue. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, this same customer accounted for 69% and 99%, respectively, of our gross accounts receivable. Although we have been growing our revenue, particularly in fiscal 2016, and launched Natesto after the close of fiscal 2016, and therefore expect to increase revenue and not be so reliant on this one customer, at least for fiscal 2017, and perhaps beyond, the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur ability to operate our business effectively may suffer if we or Ampio terminate our services agreement, or if we are unable to establish on a cost-effective basis our own administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a stand-alone company after the expiration or termination of our services agreement with Ampio.\nPrior to the Merger, we relied on administrative and other resources of Ampio to operate our business. We have entered into a services agreement to retain the ability for specified periods to use certain Ampio resources. We may elect to continue this agreement for an indefinite period of time. Any decision by us to terminate this agreement would be approved by disinterested members of our management and board of directors under our procedures regarding related party transactions. After the termination of this agreement, we will need to create our own administrative and other support systems or contract with third parties to replace Ampio\u2019s services. These services may not be provided at the same level, and we may not be able to obtain the same benefits that we received prior to the separation. These services may not be sufficient to meet our needs, and if our agreement with Ampio is terminated, we may not be able to replace these services at all or obtain these services at prices and on terms as favorable as we currently have with Ampio. Any failure or significant downtime in our own administrative systems or in Ampio\u2019s administrative systems during the transitional period could result in unexpected costs, impact our results or prevent us from paying our suppliers or employees and performing other administrative services on a timely basis.\nWe will need to develop and expand our company, and we may encounter difficulties in managing this development and expansion, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of August 15, 2016, we had 58 full-time employees, and in connection with being a public company, we expect to increase our number of employees and the scope of our operations. To manage our anticipated development and expansion, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. This may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the planned expanded commercialization of our approved products and the development of our product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to expand the market for our approved products and develop our product candidates, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of our company.\nWe depend on key personnel and attracting qualified management personnel and our business could be harmed if we lose personnel and cannot attract new personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the technical and management skills of our officers and key personnel. The loss of the services of any of these individuals would likely have a material adverse effect on us. Our success also will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management, marketing, technical, and sales executives and personnel. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key personnel. The loss of any of our key executives, or the failure to attract, integrate, motivate, and retain additional key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe compete for such personnel against numerous companies, including larger, more established companies with significantly greater financial resources than we possess. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProduct liability and other lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our product candidates.\nThe risk that we may be sued on product liability claims is inherent in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical and medical device products. Side effects of, or manufacturing defects in, products that we develop and commercialized could result in the deterioration of a patient\u2019s condition, injury or even death. Once a product is approved for sale and commercialized, the likelihood of product liability lawsuits increases. Claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief for themselves or by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class. These lawsuits may divert our management from pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend. In addition, if we are held liable in any of these lawsuits, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be forced to limit or forgo further commercialization of the affected products.\nWe may be subject to legal or administrative proceedings and litigation other than product liability lawsuits which may be costly to defend and could materially harm our business, financial condition and operations.\nAlthough we maintain general liability, clinical trial liability and product liability insurance, this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities. In addition, inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product or other legal or administrative liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercial production and sale of any of our products and product candidates that receive regulatory approval, which could adversely affect our business. Product liability claims could also harm our reputation, which may adversely affect our collaborators\u2019 ability to commercialize our products successfully.\nIn order to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we may need to hire additional qualified accounting and financial personnel with appropriate public company experience in the event that we no longer utilize the finance and administrative functions of Ampio.\nAs a public company, we must establish and maintain effective disclosure and financial controls. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial personnel with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge, and it may be difficult to recruit and maintain such personnel. Even if we are able to hire appropriate personnel, our existing operating expenses and operations will be impacted by the direct costs of their employment and the indirect consequences related to the diversion of management resources from product development efforts.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we do not believe that we have experienced any such system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates which could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe are upgrading our enterprise resource planning system and may experience difficulties with the upgrade or after its full implementation.\nAs a result of the growth of our business after April 2015, we needed to upgrade our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which upgrade we began in July 2016. Our ERP system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records, keep track of product inventory, marketing and sales, and prepare our financial statements. The implementation of the new ERP system will require additional investment of significant financial and human resources. In addition, we may not be able to successfully complete the full implementation of the ERP system without experiencing difficulties. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to monitor our business and prepare our financial statements on an accurate and timely basis.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of June 30, 2016, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $24.8 million. The available net operating losses, if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods, will begin to expire in 2032 and will completely expire in 2035. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including, without limitation, the consolidated income tax return regulations, various corporate changes could limit our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset our income. Because Ampio\u2019s equity ownership interest in our company fell to below 80% in January 2016, we will be deconsolidated from Ampio\u2019s consolidated federal income tax group. As a result, certain of our net operating loss carryforwards may not be available to us and we may not be able to use them to offset our U.S. federal taxable income. As a consequence of the deconsolidation, it is possible that certain other tax attributes and benefits resulting from U.S. federal income tax consolidation may no longer be available to us. Our company and Ampio do not have a tax sharing agreement that could mitigate the loss of net operating losses and other tax attributes resulting from the deconsolidation or our incurrence of liability for the taxes of other members of the consolidated group by reason of the joint and several liability of group members. In addition to the deconsolidation risk, an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally a 50% change (by value) in equity ownership over a three-year period) under Section 382 of the Code could limit our ability to offset, post-change, our U.S. federal taxable income. Section 382 of the Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and certain recognized built-in losses. Either the deconsolidation or the ownership change scenario could result in increased future tax liability to us.\nOur historical financial information as a business conducted by Ampio may not be representative of our results as an independent public company.\nThe historical financial information included herein does not necessarily reflect what our financial position, operating results or cash flows would have been had we been an independent entity during the year ended June 30, 2015. The historical costs and expenses reflected in our financial statements include amounts for certain corporate functions historically provided by Ampio, including costs of finance and other administrative services, and income taxes. These expense allocations were developed on the basis of what we and Ampio considered to be reasonable prices for the utilization of services provided or the benefits received by us. The historical financial information in our audited financial statements may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, changes in equity and cash flows would have been had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented or will be in the future. We have not made adjustments to reflect many significant changes that will occur in our cost structure, funding and operations as a result of our separation from Ampio, including changes in our employee base, changes in our tax structure, potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with being a publicly traded, stand-alone company, such as compliance costs, nor have we made offsetting adjustments to reflect the benefits of this offering, as these factors are presently difficult to quantify. These same risks will apply to the financial information of any business we acquire when it is included in our financial statements.\nRisks Related to Securities Markets and Investment in our Securities\nThere is not now, and there may never be, an active and orderly trading market for our common stock.\nAn active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained. As a result, investors in our common stock must bear the economic risk of holding those shares for an indefinite period of time. Although our common stock is quoted on the OTCQX, an over-the-counter quotation system, trading of our common stock is extremely limited and sporadic and at very low volumes. We do not now, and may not in the future, meet the initial listing standards of any national securities exchange, and we presently anticipate that our common stock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQX or another over-the-counter quotation system for the foreseeable future. In those venues, our stockholders may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of their shares of our common stock, and may find few buyers to purchase their stock and few market makers to support its price. As a result of these and other factors, you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the price for which you purchased them, or at all. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional equity in the future, and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using shares of our common stock as consideration.\nOur ability to uplist our common stock to the NYSE MKT or the NASDAQ Capital Market is subject to us meeting applicable listing criteria.\nWe intend to apply for our common stock to be listed on either the NYSE MKT or the NASDAQ Capital Market, each a national securities exchange The NYSE MKT and NASDAQ Capital Market require companies desiring to list their common stock on such exchanges and markets to meet certain listing criteria including total number of stockholders; minimum stock price, total value of public float, and in some cases total shareholders\u2019 equity and market capitalization. Our failure to meet such applicable listing criteria could prevent us from listing our common stock on such exchanges or markets. In the event we are unable to uplist our common stock, our common stock will continue to trade on the OTCQX market, which is generally considered less liquid and more volatile than the NYSE MKT and NASDAQ Capital Market. Our failure to uplist our common stock could make it more difficult for you to trade our common stock shares, could prevent our common stock trading on a frequent and liquid basis and could result in the value of our common stock being less than it would be if we were able to uplist.\nIf we apply and our common stock is accepted for uplisting on the NYSE MKT or the NASDAQ Capital Market, our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE MKT or the NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf our common stock were to be uplisted on the NYSE MKT or the NASDAQ Capital Market, and thereafter we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NYSE MKT or the NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, either exchange may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we anticipate that we would take actions to restore our compliance with the applicable exchange\u2019s listing requirements, such exchange, stabilize our market price, improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below such exchange\u2019s minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with such exchange\u2019s listing requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued trading standards of the OTCQX U.S. Premier tier, it may result in our common stock moving tiers in the OTC Markets.\nOur common stock is currently quoted for trading on the OTCQX U.S. Premier tier, and the continued quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX U.S. Premier tier is subject to our compliance with a number of standards. These standards include the requirement of our common stock to have a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share as of the close of business for at least one of every thirty consecutive calendar days.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAt August 15, 2016, our executive officers, directors and entities affiliated with certain of our directors beneficially owned approximately 38% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Therefore, these stockholders have the ability to influence us through their ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nThe sale of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nUnder the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, we may sell to Lincoln Park, from time to time and under certain circumstances, up to $10,000,000 of our common stock over approximately 36 months subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement that covers the resale by Lincoln Park of up to 2,500,000 shares of our common stock issuable under the Purchase Agreement. We may be required to file and have declared effective one or more additional registration statements to cover the resale by Lincoln Park of additional shares of our common stock that we may sell and issue to Lincoln Park. Generally, with respect to the Purchase Agreement, we have the right, but no obligation, to direct Lincoln Park to periodically purchase up to $10,000,000 of our common stock in specific amounts under certain conditions, which periodic purchase amounts can be increased under specified circumstances.\nDepending upon market liquidity at the time, sales of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Lincoln Park may ultimately purchase all, some or none of the $10,000,000 of common stock under the Purchase Agreement, and after it has acquired shares, Lincoln Park may sell all, some or none of those shares. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. However, we have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to Lincoln Park, and the Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any cost to us.\nFuture sales and issuances of our equity securities or rights to purchase our equity securities, including pursuant to equity incentive plans, would result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, including pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may, as we have in the past, sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be further diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders.\nPursuant to our 2015 Stock Plan, our Board of Directors is authorized to award up to a total of 833,333 shares of common stock or options to purchase shares of common stock to our officers, directors, employees and non-employee consultants. As of June 30, 2016, options to purchase 322,302 shares of common stock issued under our 2015 Stock Plan at a weighted average exercise price of $18.01 per share were outstanding. In addition, at June 30, 2016, there were outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,201,627 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $6.19. Stockholders will experience dilution in the event that additional shares of common stock are issued under our 2015 Stock Plan, or options issued under our 2015 Stock Plan are exercised, or any warrants are exercised for shares of our common stock.\nOur share price is volatile and may be influenced by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile, and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this prospectus, these factors include:\n\u00b7 the products or product candidates we acquire for commercialization;\n\u00b7 the product candidates we seek to pursue, and our ability to obtain rights to develop, commercialize and market those product candidates;\n\u00b7 our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated adverse results or delays in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 our failure to expand the market for our currently approved products or commercialize our product candidates, if approved;\n\u00b7 unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of any of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 overall performance of the equity markets and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 conditions or trends in the healthcare, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries;\n\u00b7 introduction of new products offered by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 our ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and manage such growth;\n\u00b7 issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, or the perception that such sales could occur;\n\u00b7 trading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7 ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u00b7 general political and economic conditions;\n\u00b7 effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; and\n\u00b7 other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\u00b7 adverse regulatory decisions;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u00b7 changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates, including without limitation clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u00b7 disputes or other developments relating to patents and other proprietary rights and our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 our dependence on third parties, including CROs and scientific and medical advisors;\n\u00b7 our ability to uplist our common stock to a national securities exchange;\n\u00b7 failure to meet or exceed any financial guidance or expectations regarding development milestones that we may provide to the public;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the stocks of small-cap healthcare, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted rules requiring that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative or low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA has indicated its belief that there is a high probability that speculative or low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Because these FINRA requirements are applicable to our common stock, they may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that at least some of their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market for and price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and any trading volume could decline.\nAny trading market for our common stock that may develop will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on us or our business. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively affected. If securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, and one or more of those analysts downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and any trading volume to decline.\nWe have a substantial number of shares of authorized but unissued capital stock, and if we issue additional shares of our capital stock in the future, our existing stockholders will be diluted.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of our common stock and up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with the rights, preferences and privileges that our Board of Directors may determine from time to time. As of August 15, 2016, we had 5,070,591 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, which represents approximately 4.9% of our total authorized shares of common stock. In addition to capital raising activities, which we expect to continue to pursue in order to raise the funding we will need in order to continue our operations, other possible business and financial uses for our authorized capital stock include, without limitation, future stock splits, acquiring other companies, businesses or products in exchange for shares of our capital stock, issuing shares of our capital stock to partners or other collaborators in connection with strategic alliances, attracting and retaining employees by the issuance of additional securities under our equity compensation plans, or other transactions and corporate purposes that our Board of Directors deems are in the best interest of our company. Additionally, shares of our capital stock could be used for anti-takeover purposes or to delay or prevent changes in control or our management. Any future issuances of shares of our capital stock may not be made on favorable terms or at all, they may not enhance stockholder value, they may have rights, preferences and privileges that are superior to those of our common stock, and they may have an adverse effect on our business or the trading price of our common stock. The issuance of any additional shares of our common stock will reduce the book value per share and may contribute to a reduction in the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Additionally, any such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of all of our current stockholders.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plan or otherwise, could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors in a prior transaction may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Additionally, any such sales may result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Further, any future sales of our common stock by us or resales of our common stock by our existing stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Any future grants of options, warrants or other securities exercisable or convertible into our common stock, or the exercise or conversion of such shares, and any sales of such shares in the market, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and applicable Delaware law may discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if the acquisition may be beneficial to some of our stockholders.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as certain provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so may benefit some of our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 the authorization of 50,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the rights, preferences and privileges of which may be established and shares of which may be issued by our Board of Directors at its discretion from time to time and without stockholder approval;\n\u00b7 limiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u00b7 allowing for the creation of a staggered board of directors;\n\u00b7 eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u00b7 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by the board of directors. This provision could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders.\nAny provision of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or of Delaware law that is applicable to us that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock in the event that a potentially beneficial acquisition is discouraged, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nThe elimination of personal liability against our directors and officers under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights held by our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenses.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws eliminate the personal liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent permissible under Delaware law. Further, our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws and individual indemnification agreements we intend to enter with each of our directors and executive officers provide that we are obligated to indemnify each of our directors or officers to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware law and, subject to certain conditions, advance the expenses incurred by any director or officer in defending any action, suit or proceeding prior to its final disposition. Those indemnification obligations could expose us to substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against our directors or officers, which we may be unable to afford. Further, those provisions and resulting costs may discourage us or our stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against any of our current or former directors or officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, even if such actions might otherwise benefit our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future payment of cash dividends in the future would depend on our financial condition, contractual restrictions, solvency tests imposed by applicable corporate laws, results of operations, anticipated cash requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our stockholders should not expect that we will ever pay cash or other dividends on our outstanding capital stock.\nThere is not now and may not be an active liquid trading market for our publicly traded warrants.\nThere is no established public trading market for our publicly traded warrants issued in May 2016 and that trade on the OTCQX. There is no assurance that an active trading market will develop or if one develops that it will be maintained. Without an active market, the liquidity of the warrants will remain limited.", "PERMNO": 16974, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AYTU"}
