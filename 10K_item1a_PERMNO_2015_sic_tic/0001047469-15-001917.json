Certain important factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nWe currently have no product revenues and we will need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, in order to continue operating our business.\nTo date, we have generated no product revenues. Until, and unless, we receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other foreign regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we will not be permitted to sell our drugs and will not have product revenues. Currently,\nour only product candidates are abaloparatide-SC, abaloparatide-TD, RAD1901 and RAD140, and none of these product candidates is approved by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities for sale. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, we will have to fund our operations and capital expenditures with our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, or through strategic financing opportunities, future offerings of our equity, and/or the incurrence of debt. We believe that our existing resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2016. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use up our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. If we fail to obtain additional capital, we may be unable to complete our planned preclinical and clinical trials and obtain approval of any product candidates from the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development, reduce or forego sales and marketing efforts for any product candidate that is approved, forego attractive business opportunities or discontinue our operations entirely. Any additional sources of financing may not be available or may not be available on favorable terms and will likely involve the issuance of additional equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on stockholders. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the scope and progress made in our research and development activities and our clinical studies.\nWe are not currently profitable and may never become profitable.\nWe have a history of net losses and expect to incur substantial losses and have negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability. We had net losses of $62.5 million, $60.7 million, and $69.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $344.2 million. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we:\n\u2022 continue to undertake preclinical development and clinical trials for product candidates;\n\u2022 seek regulatory approvals for product candidates;\n\u2022 implement additional internal systems and infrastructure; and\n\u2022 hire additional personnel.\nWe also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. Accordingly, unless and until we generate revenues and become profitable, we will need to raise additional capital to continue to operate our business. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability or to raise additional capital could negatively impact the value of our securities.\nOur credit facility imposes significant restrictions on our business, and if we default on our obligations, the lenders would have a right to foreclose on substantially all our assets.\nIn May 2014, we entered into our new $30.0 million credit facility with Solar Capital Ltd., as collateral agent and lender, and Oxford Finance LLC, as lender. We drew $21.0 million under our new credit facility on May 30, 2014, and used approximately $9.3 million to repay our existing credit facility. Pursuant to an amendment to the credit facility, we drew an additional $4.0 million on July 10, 2014. Our new credit facility contains a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including covenants that limit our ability to:\n\u2022 dispose of our business or certain assets;\n\u2022 change our business, management, ownership or business locations;\n\u2022 incur additional debt or liens;\n\u2022 make certain investments or declare dividends;\n\u2022 acquire or merge with another entity;\n\u2022 enter into licensing agreements;\n\u2022 engage in transactions with affiliates; or\n\u2022 encumber our intellectual property.\nOur credit facility may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities. It may also prevent us from engaging in activities that could be beneficial to our business and our stockholders unless we repay the outstanding debt, which may not be desirable or possible.\nWe have pledged substantially all of our assets other than our intellectual property to secure our obligations under our credit facility. If we default on our obligations and are unable to obtain a waiver for such a default, the lenders would have a right to accelerate the debt and terminate all commitments under our credit facility. They would also have the right to foreclose on the pledged assets, including our cash and cash equivalents. Any such action on the part of lenders against us would significantly harm our business and our ability to operate.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, other marketing and distribution arrangements, equity offerings, and debt financings. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or we may need to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe are a company with a limited operating history upon which to base an investment decision.\nWe are a company with a limited operating history and have not demonstrated an ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates. The successful commercialization of any product candidates will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u2022 continuing to undertake preclinical development and clinical trials;\n\u2022 participating in regulatory approval processes;\n\u2022 formulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u2022 conducting sales and marketing activities for products if approved.\nOur operations have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary technology and undertaking preclinical and clinical trials of our product candidates. These operations provide a limited basis for you to assess our ability to commercialize our product candidates and the advisability of investing further in our securities.\nOur financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. For these reasons, comparing our financial results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our revenues, if any, may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and our future quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may be significantly different from those we have recorded in the past or which we expect for the future. Our financial results in some quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events as well as the various risk factors listed in this \"Risk Factors\" section could adversely affect our financial results and cause our stock price to fall.\nRisks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of abaloparatide-SC which is under clinical development. We cannot be certain that abaloparatide-SC will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if we receive regulatory approval.\nAbaloparatide-SC is our only product candidate in late-stage clinical development, and our business currently depends heavily on its successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization. We have no drug products for sale currently and may never be able to develop approved and marketable drug products. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market abaloparatide-SC in the United States unless and until we receive approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, from the FDA, or in any foreign countries unless and until we receive the requisite approval from regulatory authorities in foreign countries. In addition, the approval of abaloparatide-TD as a line extension to abaloparatide-SC is dependent on the earlier approval of abaloparatide-SC. We have not submitted an NDA to the FDA or comparable applications to regulatory authorities in other countries. Obtaining approval of a product candidate is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and any approval of abaloparatide-SC may be delayed, limited or denied for many reasons, including:\n\u2022 we may not be able to demonstrate that abaloparatide is safe and effective as a treatment for reduction of fracture risk in postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis to the satisfaction of the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 the results of our clinical studies may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required for marketing approval;\n\u2022 the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u2022 any clinical research organizations, or CROs, that we have retained or may in the future retain, to conduct clinical studies may take actions outside of our control that materially adversely impact our clinical studies;\n\u2022 the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical studies sufficient to demonstrate that abaloparatide's clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022 the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from our preclinical studies and clinical studies or may require that we conduct additional studies;\n\u2022 the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data generated at our clinical study sites;\n\u2022 the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with our proposed labeling and may require labeling that undermines or otherwise significantly impairs the commercial value of the product if it were to be approved with such labeling;\n\u2022 the FDA may require development of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval;\n\u2022 if our NDA is reviewed by an advisory committee, the FDA may have difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting in a timely manner or the advisory committee may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend that the FDA require, as a condition of approval, additional preclinical studies or clinical studies, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions; or\n\u2022 the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of our third-party manufacturers.\nIn addition, the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations. For example, on February 15, 2012, we received a letter from the FDA stating that, after internal consideration, the FDA believes that a minimum of 24-month fracture data are necessary for approval of new products for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Our abaloparatide-SC pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial is designed to produce fracture data based on an 18-month primary endpoint. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that continued use of the 18-month primary endpoint will be acceptable, provided that our NDA includes the 24-month fracture data derived from the first six months extension of the abaloparatide 80 \u00b5g and placebo groups in our Phase 3 study, which groups will receive an approved alendronate (generic Fosamax) therapy for osteoporosis management. We plan to submit our NDA with the 24-month fracture data. We cannot be certain that the FDA will be supportive of this plan, will not change this approval policy again or will not adopt other approval policies or regulations that adversely affect any NDA that we may submit, the occurrence of any of which may further delay FDA approval.\nBefore we submit an NDA to the FDA for abaloparatide-SC as a proposed treatment for osteoporosis, we must complete the first six months of the alendronate extension study of the abaloparatide and placebo groups from our Phase 3 clinical and submit 24-month fracture data to the FDA. We also must complete several additional studies, including, but not limited to, a thorough QT Phase 1 study and a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study in renal patients. The results of these studies will have an important bearing on the approval of abaloparatide.\nWe cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any of our product candidates, including abaloparatide-SC, abaloparatide-TD, RAD1901 and RAD140, or any product candidate we may acquire or develop in the future. We will need FDA approval to commercialize our product candidates in the United States and approvals from the regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our product candidates in those jurisdictions. In order to obtain FDA approval of any product candidate, we must submit to the FDA an NDA demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its indicated use. This\ndemonstration requires significant research and animal tests, which are referred to as preclinical studies, as well as human tests, which are referred to as clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA's regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for proposed uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during its regulatory review, such as the request we received from the FDA with respect to providing a minimum of 24-month fracture data for approval of abaloparatide. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may:\n\u2022 delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates;\n\u2022 impose costly procedures on us; and\n\u2022 diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs. We may never obtain regulatory clearance for any of our product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by leaving us without a saleable product, and therefore without any source of revenues, until another product candidate can be developed. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop or acquire any product candidate.\nIn foreign jurisdictions, we must receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize any drugs. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above. We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any of our product candidates for sale outside the United States.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. A substantial portion of our abaloparatide development costs are denominated in euros and any adverse movement in the dollar/euro exchange rate will result in increased costs and require us to raise additional capital to complete the development of our products. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:\n\u2022 changes in government regulation, administrative action or changes in FDA or other foreign regulatory authority policy with respect to clinical trials that change the requirements for approval;\n\u2022 unforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022 determination of dosing issues;\n\u2022 lack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u2022 slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;\n\u2022 failure of sites to comply with requirements for conducting clinical trials;\n\u2022 inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; and\n\u2022 inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nIn addition, we, the FDA, or other equivalent regulatory authorities and ethics committees with jurisdiction over our studies may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities find deficiencies in our regulatory submissions or the conduct of these trials. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty the schedule for existing or future clinical trials. Any such unexpected expenses or delays in our clinical trials could increase our need for additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nMost of our investigational product candidates are in early stages of clinical trials.\nExcept for abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-TD, each of our other product candidates (i.e., RAD1901 and RAD140) is in the early stages of development and requires extensive preclinical and clinical testing. We cannot predict with any certainty if or when we might submit an NDA or equivalent application to foreign regulatory authorities for regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or whether any such NDA or equivalent application would be accepted for filing by FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities or approved if filed.\nThe results of clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that the results will support regulatory approval of our product candidates. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for proposed uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the submission of our NDAs to the FDA or equivalent application to foreign regulatory authorities and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. In addition, our clinical trials to date have involved small patient populations. Because of the small sample sizes, the results of these clinical trials may not be indicative of future results.\nIn addition, third parties could conduct clinical trials using the product candidates we license. We would have no control over how these trials are conducted and the results could potentially contradict the results we have obtained, or will obtain from the clinical trials we conduct.\nIf serious adverse or undesirable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may need to abandon our development of some of our product candidates.\nAll of our product candidates are still in preclinical or clinical development. Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval, if ever. If our product candidates result in undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development. Drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022 we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical studies, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if we obtain marketing approval of a product candidate, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label use and, if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022 restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022 restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022 restrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022 requirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u2022 warning or untitled letters;\n\u2022 withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022 voluntary or mandatory recall of products and related publicity requirements;\n\u2022 fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022 suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022 refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022 product seizure; or\n\u2022 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition, the FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit, or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nThe commercial success of any product candidates that we may develop and that may be approved will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by regulators, key opinion leaders, physicians, patients, healthcare payers and others in the medical community.\nEven if the FDA or other foreign regulatory authority approves one or more of our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept and use them. Acceptance and use of any of our products will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u2022 perceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians and key opinion leaders, about the safety and effectiveness of our drug;\n\u2022 cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products;\n\u2022 availability of coverage and reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payers; and\n\u2022 effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nIf any of our product candidates are commercialized and unexpected adverse events are reported in connection with the use of any of those products, physician and patient acceptance of the product could deteriorate and the commercial success of such product could be adversely affected. We are required to report to the FDA or similar bodies in other countries events associated with our products relating to death or serious injury. Adverse events could result in additional regulatory controls, such as for the imposition of costly post-approval clinical studies or revisions to approved labeling which could limit the indications or patient population for a product or could even lead to the withdrawal of a product from the market. Because we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these drugs to gain market acceptance or, once gained, a decrease in market acceptance would harm our business and would require us to seek additional financing.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we narrowly focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate\nthrough collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nIf we experience delays in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for some of our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, many of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors' product candidates.\nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of the company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any of our current or future clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nOur drug development program depends upon third-party researchers, investigators and collaborators who are outside our control.\nWe depend upon independent researchers, investigators and collaborators, to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. These third parties are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and requirements, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our third party researchers, investigators and collaborators are required to comply with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. In addition, these third parties may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug-development programs, or if their performance is substandard, the approval of our FDA or foreign regulatory authority applications, if any, and our introduction of new drugs, if any, will be delayed. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may compete with us. If our collaborators assist competitors at our expense, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIf a regulatory or governmental authority determines that a financial interest in the outcome of the Phase 3 study of abaloparatide-SC by any of the entities managing our Phase 3 clinical trial affected the reliability of the data from the Phase 3 clinical trial, our ability to use the data for our planned regulatory submissions could be compromised, which could harm our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe Phase 3 clinical trial and subsequent extension studies of abaloparatide-SC are being managed by Nordic at certain clinical sites operated by the Center for Clinical and Basic Research, or CCBR, a leading global CRO with extensive experience in global osteoporosis registration studies. Nordic controls, and holds an ownership interest in, the local CCBR clinical sites. The clinical trial investigators are employees of CCBR and may also hold an equity interest in the local CCBR clinical trials.\nIn consideration of Nordic's management of our Phase 3 clinical trial and subsequent extension studies, we have agreed to make various cash payments to Nordic denominated in both euros and U.S. dollars over the course of the Phase 3 study equal to a total of up to approximately \u20ac48.6 million ($58.8 million) and a total of up to approximately $4.4 million plus up to an additional $5.0 million in aggregate performance incentive payments, payable in cash or stock depending on the timing of the closing of an underwritten offering of shares of our common stock. We also agreed to sell shares of capital stock to Nordic that were exchanged in the Merger for 6,443 shares of our series A-5 convertible preferred stock for proceeds of approximately $0.5 million. These shares of our series A-5 convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 28,258 shares of our common stock upon the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Pursuant to the terms of our agreements with Nordic, we were required to issue to Nordic shares of stock with an aggregate value of up to approximately \u20ac44.3 million ($53.6 million) and $0.8 million in consideration of Nordic's management of the Phase 3 clinical trial. These shares of stock accrued at a quarterly rate based on the progress of the Phase 3 clinical trial and were issuable at a price per share equal to the greater of (1) the fair market value of our common stock as of the applicable accrual date or (2) $81.42 and rounding down the resulting quotient to the nearest whole number. On each of December 31, 2013 and March 31, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a stock dividend to pay all shares of stock that had accrued as of such dates and that were anticipated to accrue through December 31, 2014, representing an aggregate of 682,958 shares of our Series A-6 convertible preferred stock that automatically converted into 2,995,453 shares of our common stock upon the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Following the completion of our initial public offering of shares of our common stock on June 11, 2014, or our initial public offering, all compensation remaining payable to Nordic in consideration of their management of our Phase 3 clinical trial became payable in cash.\nThe fair market value of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including any negative outcome of the Phase 3 study. Accordingly, the shares of stock that we have issued to Nordic in consideration of Nordic's management of the Phase 3 clinical trial may be less than the full value originally anticipated under our agreements with Nordic, assuming Nordic did not expect the fair market value of our stock to fluctuate widely over the term of such agreements. As a result, the total consideration that Nordic will receive in cash and stock may be viewed to be below the market price paid by other companies for comparable clinical trial services.\nBecause of the potential decrease in the value of the common stock issued to Nordic upon a negative outcome of the Phase 3 study, Nordic, CCBR and the clinical trial investigators may be viewed as having a financial interest in the outcome of the study. We have obtained written acknowledgments from the clinical trial investigators certifying that they have no financial interest in the outcome of the Phase 3 clinical trial. However, if the FDA, the EMA, or any other similar regulatory or governmental authority determines that Nordic, CCBR or the clinical trial investigators have a financial interest that affected the reliability of the data from the Phase 3 clinical trial, we could be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny and the utility of the Phase 3 clinical trial for purposes of our planned regulatory\nsubmissions could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our common stock.\nWe will rely exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates.\nWe have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We lack the resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own product candidates. We have entered into agreements with contract manufacturers to manufacture abaloparatide for use in clinical trial activities. These contract manufacturers are currently our only source for the production and formulation of abaloparatide. We may not have sufficient clinical supplies of abaloparatide but believe that our contract manufacturers will be able to produce sufficient supply of abaloparatide to complete all of the planned abaloparatide clinical studies. If our contract manufacturers are unable to produce, in a timely manner, adequate clinical supplies to meet the needs of our clinical studies, we would be required to seek new contract manufacturers that may require us to modify our finished product formulation and modify or terminate our clinical studies for abaloparatide. Any modification of our finished product or modification or termination of our clinical studies could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and significantly delay or prevent the commercial launch of the product if it were to be approved, which would materially harm our business and impair our ability to raise capital. In addition, the facilities and processes and controls used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA to the FDA. We do not control the facilities or manufacturing process and controls of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements, known as cGMPs, for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nWe depend on a number of single source contract manufacturers to supply key components of abaloparatide. For example, we depend on Lonza Group Ltd., or Lonza, which produces supplies of bulk drug product of abaloparatide to support the abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-TD clinical studies and any potential commercial launch. We also depend on Vetter Pharma Fertigung GmbH & Co, or Vetter, and Ypsomed AG, or Ypsomed, for the production of finished supplies of abaloparatide-SC and we depend on 3M for the production of abaloparatide-TD. Because of our dependence on Vetter for the \"fill and finish\" part of the manufacturing process for abaloparatide-SC, we are subject to the risk that Vetter may not have the capacity from time to time to produce sufficient quantities of abaloparatide to meet the needs of our clinical studies or be able to scale to commercial production of abaloparatide. Because the manufacturing process for abaloparatide-TD requires the use of 3M's proprietary technology, 3M is our sole source for finished clinical trial supplies of abaloparatide-TD. To date, we have not entered into a commercial supply agreement with 3M. If we were not able to negotiate commercial supply terms with 3M, as we depend on 3M for production of abaloparatide-TD, we would be unable to commercialize this product if it were to be approved. Or, if we are forced to accept unfavorable terms for our future relationship with 3M, our business and financial condition would be materially harmed.\nWhile we are currently in discussions, to date, we have not entered into a long-term agreement with any of Lonza, Vetter or Ypsomed, each of whom currently produces abaloparatide or related components on a purchase order basis for us. Accordingly, Lonza, Vetter and Ypsomed could terminate\ntheir relationship with us at any time and for any reason. We may not be able to negotiate long-term agreements on acceptable terms, or at all. If our relationship with any of these contract manufacturers is terminated, or if they are unable to produce abaloparatide or related components in required quantities, on a timely basis or at all, or if we are forced to accept unfavorable terms for our future relationship, our business and financial condition would be materially harmed. If any of our current product candidates or any product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future receive FDA or foreign regulatory authority approval, we will rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture our drugs or related components. Our anticipated future reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks:\n\u2022 We may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would require new testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products after receipt of FDA approval, if any.\n\u2022 Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our drugs or related components in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical needs and commercial needs, if any.\n\u2022 Our future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products.\n\u2022 Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, for any controlled substances, and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP, and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards and failure to comply with cGMP or corresponding foreign standards can result in compliance actions that may limit a manufacturer's production or prohibit a manufacturer from producing some or all products at a facility. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers' compliance with these regulations and standards.\n\u2022 If any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authority or the commercialization of our product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues\nIf we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development plans.\nOur product development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may also be restricted under existing collaboration agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with other potential collaborators. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. If that were to occur, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain\nadditional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenue.\nRisks Related to Marketing and Sale of Our Products\nWe have no experience selling, marketing or distributing products and currently do not have the internal capability to do so.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships for such capabilities, the collaborators' strategic interest in the products under development and such collaborators' ability to successfully market and sell any such products. We intend to build an internal sales force to market and sell our products to specialists within the target indications if approved and to pursue collaborative arrangements to market and sell our products to primary care physicians within the target indications if approved. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and we cannot assure you that their efforts will be successful. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with such third party collaborators or that we would be able to market and sell our products in the United States or overseas through an in-house sales force in lieu of such relationships.\nIf we cannot compete successfully for market share against other drug companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nThe market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. If any of our product candidates receives FDA or other foreign regulatory authority approval, it will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed, manufactured and marketed by others. Existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products, or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. If our products fail to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nWe will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors have compounds already approved or in development. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u2022 developing drugs;\n\u2022 undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u2022 obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs;\n\u2022 formulating and manufacturing drugs; and\n\u2022 launching, marketing and selling drugs.\nDevelopments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Some of the drugs that we are attempting to develop, such as abaloparatide-SC, abaloparatide-TD, RAD1901 and RAD140, will have to compete against existing therapies if they are approved. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the United States and abroad. In\naddition, companies doing business in different but related fields represent substantial competition. Many of these organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals, and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations, and therefore, we may not be able to hire or retain qualified personnel to run all facets of our business. These risks could render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.\nOur ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if our drugs sell for inadequate prices or patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement.\nOur ability to commercialize our drugs, alone or with collaborators, will depend in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement will be available from:\n\u2022 government and health administration authorities;\n\u2022 private health maintenance organizations and health insurers; and\n\u2022 other healthcare payers.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Healthcare payers, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Government and other healthcare payers increasingly attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs. Even if one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authority, insurance coverage may not be available, and reimbursement levels may be inadequate, to cover the costs of our drug. If government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our product candidates, once approved, market acceptance of our products could be reduced.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits.\nThe testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. Even if one of our investigational product candidates is approved by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authority, if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of intellectual property license agreements with third parties and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that any future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop and market any product that is covered by these agreements. Termination of these licenses or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms. The occurrence of such events could materially harm our business.\nIf our efforts to protect our intellectual property related to abaloparatide-SC, abaloparatide-TD, RAD1901 and/or RAD140 fail to adequately protect these assets or if we are unable to secure all necessary intellectual property, we may lose the ability to license or successfully commercialize one or more of these candidates.\nOur commercial success is significantly dependent on intellectual property related to our product portfolio of product candidates. We are either the licensee or assignee of numerous issued and pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our assets, including abaloparatide-SC, abaloparatide-TD, RAD1901 and RAD140.\nPatents covering abaloparatide as a composition of matter have been issued in the United States (US Patent No. 5,969,095) and several additional countries. Because the abaloparatide composition of matter patent was filed in 1996, it is expected to have an expiration in 2016 in the United States (this date does not include the possibility of Hatch-Waxman patent term extension, which could extend the expiration in the United States into the first quarter of 2021 if an application for extension is made and the maximum extension is granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO), and additional countries where it has issued. European Patent No. 0847278, which was included in the license from Ipsen and claimed the composition of matter of abaloparatide, lapsed due to Ipsen's failure to pay annuities. We are pursuing restoration of those patent rights. To date, the patent rights in Finland, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain and United Kingdom have been restored. We believe that the data and market exclusivity provided in Europe for a new chemical entity, coupled with the need for a potential competitor to conduct clinical trials, will likely provide a longer barrier to entry than the patent protection provided by the original European patent term, which would have expired in 2016, plus a five year maximum Supplemental Protection Certificate.\nWe and Ipsen are also co-assignees to US Patent No. 7,803,770 that we believe provides exclusivity until October 3, 2027 and may be extended to March 26, 2028 in the United States (absent any Hatch-Waxman patent term extension) for the method of treating osteoporosis with the intended therapeutic dose for abaloparatide-SC.\nWe and Ipsen Pharma SAS, or Ipsen, are also co-assignees to US Patent No. 8,148,333 that we believe provides exclusivity until 2027 in the United States (absent any Hatch-Waxman patent term extension) for the intended therapeutic formulation for abaloparatide-SC.\nWe and 3M are co-assignees to several foreign and corresponding U.S. patent applications with the earliest priority date of April 22, 2011, which cover various aspects of abaloparatide for microneedle application. Any issued patents resulting from these applications will expire in 2032. However, pending patent applications in the United States and elsewhere may not issue since the interpretation of the legal requirements of patentability in view of claimed inventions are not always predictable. Additional intellectual property covering abaloparatide-TD technology exists in the form of proprietary information protected as trade secrets. These can be accidentally disclosed to, independently derived by or misappropriated by competitors, possibly reducing or eliminating the exclusivity advantages of this form of intellectual property, thereby allowing those competitors more rapid entry into the marketplace with a competitive product thus reducing our advantage with abaloparatide-TD. In addition, trade secrets may in some instances become publicly available through required disclosures in regulatory files. Alternatively, competitors may sometimes reverse engineer a product once it becomes available on the market. Even where a competitor does not use an identical technology for the delivery of abaloparatide, it is possible that they could achieve an equivalent or even superior result using another technology. Such occurrences could lead to either one or more alternative competitor products becoming available on the market and/or one or more generic competitor products on the market gaining market share and causing a corresponding decrease in market share and/or price for abaloparatide-TD even if it were to be successfully developed and approved by FDA.\nPatents covering RAD1901 as a composition of matter, as well as the use of RAD1901 for the treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer, have been issued in the United States, Canada and\nAustralia and are pending in Europe and India. The RAD1901 composition of matter patents in the United States expire in 2023 and 2026 (absent any Hatch-Waxman patent term extension). Additional patent applications relating to methods of treating vasomotor symptoms and clinical dosage strengths using RAD1901 have been filed. Pending patent applications in the United States and elsewhere may not issue since the interpretation of the legal requirements of patentability in view of any claimed invention before a patent office are not always predictable. As a result, we could encounter challenges or difficulties in building, maintaining and/or defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad.\nPatent applications covering RAD140 and other SARM compounds have been granted in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico, Japan and Australia, and are pending in the United States and elsewhere. The RAD140 composition of matter patents expire in 2029 in the United States (absent any Hatch-Waxman patent term extension) and additional countries if and when it issues.\nSince patents are technical legal documents that are frequently subject to intense litigation pressure, there is risk that even if one or more patents related to our products does issue and is asserted that the patent(s) will be found invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed when subject to said litigation. Finally, the intellectual property laws and practices can vary considerably from one country to another and also can change with time. As a result, we could encounter challenges or difficulties in building, maintaining and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad.\nWe may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to patents issued or licensed to us, including interference proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties also may assert infringement claims against us. If we are found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. For example, we are aware of a provisional patent application recently filed with the USPTO that could be relevant to the use of RAD1901 to treat indications for which we are developing RAD1901. If a patent issues from this patent application with claims covering the use of RAD1901 to treat indications for which we are developing RAD1901, we may need to license the patent in order to commercialize RAD1901 specifically for the treatment of such indications even if RAD1901 were successfully developed and approved. We are evaluating whether to enter into negotiations for such license. We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure a license on reasonable terms, if at all. If we need a license of such patent in order to commercialize RAD1901 and are unable to secure one on reasonable terms, our business would be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or products that we license from them, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our and our licensors' ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. In some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and\nprosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or products that we license from third parties. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. In addition, if third parties who license patents to us fail to maintain these patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors' patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors' pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or products or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States, prior to March 16, 2013, the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent (a \"first-to-invent\" system), while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent (a \"first-to-file\" system). With the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, the United States now has a first-to-file system for patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013. We may become involved in opposition, interference or derivation proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Any challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patents may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nPayments, fees, submissions and various additional requirements must be met in order for pending patent applications to advance in prosecution and issued patents to be maintained. Rigorous compliance with these requirements is essential to procurement and maintenance of patents integral to our product portfolio.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or patent applications will come due for payment periodically throughout the lifecycle of\npatent applications and issued patents. In order to help ensure that we comply with any required fee payment, documentary and/or procedural requirements as they might relate to any patents for which we are an assignee or co-assignee, we employ competent legal help and related professionals as needed to comply with those requirements. Our outside patent counsel uses Computer Packages, Inc. for patent annuity payments. We depend on Eisai and/or Ipsen to comply with any required fee payment, documentary and/or procedural requirements as they might relate to any patents we have licensed. Failure to meet a required fee payment, document production or procedural requirement can result in the abandonment of a pending patent application or the lapse of an issued patent. In some instances the defect can be cured through late compliance but there are situations where the failure to meet the required event cannot be cured. Any failures could compromise the intellectual property protection around our preclinical or clinical candidates and possibly weaken or eliminate our ability to protect our eventual market share for that product.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to our patented technology and products, we rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to our trade secrets, such as our corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. However, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products and could be forced to pay damages and defend against litigation.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and may have to:\n\u2022 obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022 abandon an infringing drug candidate;\n\u2022 redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u2022 stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u2022 pay damages; or\n\u2022 defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid and/or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated and/or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, our licensors may have rights to file and prosecute these types of claims, and we may be reliant on them to do so.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nSome of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities, delaying the development of our product candidates. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Litigation or other proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct any litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of any litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nRisks Related to Legislation and Administrative Actions\nHealthcare reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, legislation is implemented to reign in rising healthcare expenditures. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or PPACA. PPACA includes a number of provisions affecting the pharmaceutical industry, including annual, non-deductible fees on any entity that manufactures or imports some types of branded prescription drugs and biologics and increases in Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In addition,\namong other things, PPACA also establishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. Most recently, on August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which may result in such changes as aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of two percent per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The full impact on our business of these new laws is uncertain. We cannot predict whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the pharmaceutical industry generally or our business in particular.\nWe are subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement, and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe are subject to several healthcare regulations and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of various electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u2022 the federal healthcare programs' Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation; in addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u2022 federal false claims laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022 federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022 the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Data from the first reporting period, which began in August 2013, is now publicly available. Manufacturers will be required to submit subsequent reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year; and\n\u2022 state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare\nproviders and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nOur operations and commercial activities will be subject to comprehensive compliance obligations under state and federal fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency laws and government pricing regulations, as described above. If we are found to be in violation of these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nWe may be exposed to liability claims associated with the use of hazardous materials and chemicals.\nOur research and development activities may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, storing, handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nAs we evolve from a company primarily involved in drug discovery and development into one that is also involved in the commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we may have difficulty managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nOur success will depend upon the expansion of our operations and the effective management of our growth, and if we are unable to manage this growth effectively, our business will be harmed. As we advance our product candidates through the development process, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, quality, distribution, sales and marketing capabilities or contract with other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various collaborators, suppliers and other organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. For example, some jurisdictions, such as the District of Columbia, have imposed licensing requirements for sales representatives. In addition, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as well as the federal government by way of the Sunshine Act, have established reporting requirements that would require public reporting of compensation and other \"transfers of value\" paid to health care professionals and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such professionals and their immediate family members. Because the reporting requirements vary in each jurisdiction, compliance will be complex and expensive and may create barriers to entering the commercialization phase. The need to build new systems as part of our growth could place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. We may not be able to make improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. Such requirements may also impact our opportunities to collaborate with physicians at academic research centers as new restrictions on academic-industry relationships are put in place. In the past, collaborations between academia and industry have led to\nimportant new innovations, but the new laws may have an effect on these activities. While we cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory changes will have negative or positive effects, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and potential profitability.\nWe may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions which may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, divert management attention or dilute stockholder value.\nWe may enter into business combinations and acquisitions. We have limited experience in making acquisitions, which are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022 the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022 the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022 the potential for unknown liabilities and expenses;\n\u2022 the failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;\n\u2022 the maintenance of acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022 the impairment of relationships with employees as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel.\nIf we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future, we would be required to reevaluate our business strategy and we may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete the acquisitions. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price, or we could issue additional securities as consideration for these acquisitions, which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution.\nWe rely on key executive officers and scientific and medical advisors, and their knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace.\nWe are highly dependent on our chief executive officer and our principal scientific, regulatory and medical advisors. We do not have \"key person\" life insurance policies for any of our officers. The loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise of any of our key personnel could result in delays in product development, loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.\nWe will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nOur stock price may be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022 our operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022 the success of competitive products;\n\u2022 the overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022 the number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u2022 threatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022 changes in laws or regulations relating to our products, including changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022 any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022 publication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022 large volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders;\n\u2022 general political, economic and market conditions; and\n\u2022 the other factors described in this \"Risk factors\" section.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies whose shares trade in the stock market. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock shortly following the initial public offering. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company's securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management's attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of our credit facility preclude us from paying cash dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company and prior to the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and NASDAQ have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and are making some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, and are required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting\nobligations as a publicly traded company or comply with the requirements of the SEC or Section 404. This could result in a restatement of our financial statements, the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common shares, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements or by disclosure of an accounting, reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our securities and our business. Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain.\nOur directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates, have substantial influence over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nOur directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates, beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to significantly influence the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022 delaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control;\n\u2022 impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022 discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nAdditional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nPursuant to our equity incentive plans, our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants. We have reserved 4,559,510 shares of our common stock for issuance under our equity incentive plans as of December 31, 2014, which includes 3,220,380 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of options outstanding as of December 31, 2014, and will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, warrants to purchase 1,379,671 shares of our common stock were outstanding. Shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of these warrants may be sold in the public market, subject to prior registration, or under an exemption from registration. Furthermore, in connection with the public offering of our common stock in January 2015, our directors, officers and their affiliated entities entered into lock-up agreements under which they have agreed not to sell, transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of our common stock or any securities exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our common stock for a period of 90 days, subject to a possible extension under certain circumstances. After the expiration of the lock-up period, these shares may be sold in the public market, subject to prior registration or under an exemption from registration, including compliance with Rule 144. If any of these additional shares\nare sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022 a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022 authorizing the board to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022 authorizing the board to amend our bylaws and to fill board vacancies until the next annual meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022 prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022 limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022 eliminating the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u2022 requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, prohibits, subject to some exceptions, \"business combinations\" between a Delaware corporation and an \"interested stockholder,\" which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation's voting stock, for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.\nThese and other provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $319.7 million of federal and $246.5 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code has\npreviously occurred. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may become subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.", "PERMNO": 14707, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RDUS"}
