{"cik": "715446", "company": "Anixa Biosciences Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-01-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty, including the following risks and uncertainties:\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Operations\nWe have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.\nOn a cumulative basis we have sustained substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of October 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was approximately $170,170,000. As of October 31, 2018, we had approximately $5,056,000 in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and working capital of approximately $4,273,000. In fiscal year 2018, we incurred losses of approximately $14,243,000 and we experienced negative cash flows from operations of approximately $4,273,000. We expect to incur material research and development expenses and to continue incurring significant legal and general and administrative expenses in connection with our operations. As a result, we anticipate that we will incur losses in the future.\nWe will need additional funding in the future which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if available, may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nBased on currently available information as of January 11, 2019, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and expected cash flows will be sufficient to fund our activities for the next 12 months. However, our projections of future cash needs and cash flows may differ from actual results. If current cash on hand, cash equivalents, short term investments and cash that may be generated from our business operations are insufficient to continue to operate our business, or if we elect to invest in or acquire a company or companies that are synergistic with or complimentary to our technologies, we may be required to obtain more working capital. We may seek to obtain working capital through sales of our equity securities or through bank credit facilities or public or private debt from various financial institutions where possible. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do identify sources for additional funding, the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt could result in dilution to our stockholders. Additionally, the sale of equity securities or issuance of debt securities may be subject to certain security holder approvals or may result in the downward adjustment of the exercise or conversion price of our outstanding securities. We can give no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flows in the future to satisfy our liquidity requirements or sustain future operations, or that other sources of funding, such as sales of equity or debt, would be available or would be approved by our security holders, if needed, on favorable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain additional working capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, such lack of funds may inhibit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital needs, or may force us to reduce operating expenses, which would significantly harm the business and development of operations.\nFailure to effectively manage our potential growth could place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business strategy and potential growth may place a strain on managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Although we may not grow as we expect, if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to develop and expand our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems, our business and financial results will be materially harmed.\nWe may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited resources, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs or product candidates or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.\nWe are currently subject to a putative shareholder derivative complaint which could distract our management and could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us.\nOn November 5, 2018, a putative shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Howland v. Kumar et al., C.A. No. 2018-0804-KSJM (the \u201cHowland Matter\u201d), that alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. The complaint named as defendants certain of the Company\u2019s current and former officers and directors, and the Company is named solely as a nominal defendant. The complaint seeks, on behalf of the Company, a declaration that the defendant officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties, unspecified damages, certain changes to the Company\u2019s internal procedures, and an award of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on November 29, 2018 and the parties are currently engaged in briefing the motion. If the Howland Matter is not dismissed at the pleading stage, we will be required to devote significant time to the adjudication of the matter which will distract our management and may have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, if the Howland Matter is not dismissed, we could incur substantial costs related to the adjudication of the Howland Matter that may not be covered by insurance. In addition, we are obligated pursuant to Article 10 of our by-laws, as amended (the \"By-Laws\"), to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to, or testifies in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in nature, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company against expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding to the full extent permitted by law. Accordingly, we may incur substantial costs related to the indemnification of our current and former officers and directors that were named as defendants in the Howland Matter. While we have director and officer insurance, there is no assurance that our policy will cover any or all of the costs associated with the indemnification of our current and former officers and directors that were named as defendants in the Howland Matter.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception and we may never achieve or sustain profitability. Generally, losses incurred will carry forward until such losses expire (for losses generated prior to January 1, 2018) or are used to offset future taxable income, if any. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 or 383 has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our inception. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset such taxable income will be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, even if we attain profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our future cash flows.\nWe have not yet determined the consequences to our business of the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (see the risk factor entitled, \u201cU.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us and holders of our common stock\u201d below), which could increase our future U.S. tax expense. For example, the new tax laws impose a reduction to the maximum deduction allowed for NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, but allow such NOLs to be carried forward indefinitely. These changes may adversely affect our future cash flows.\nOur employees, scientific advisors, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, scientific advisors, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA or other regulatory bodies, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical studies, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We currently have a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and our code of conduct and the other precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could have a significant impact on our business. Whether or not we are successful in defending against such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations.\nRisks Related to our Biotechnology Research & Development Activities\nOur cancer diagnostic and cancer therapeutics businesses are pre-revenue, and subject to the risks of an early stage biotechnology company.\nSince the Company\u2019s primary focus for the foreseeable future will likely be our cancer diagnostics and therapeutics businesses, shareholders should understand that we are primarily an early stage biotechnology company with no history of revenue-generating operations, and our only assets consist of our proprietary and licensed technologies and the know-how of our officers. Therefore we are subject to all the risks and uncertainties inherent in a new business, in particular new businesses engaged in the early detection of certain cancers and CAR-T cancer therapeutics. Cchek\u00d4 and our CAR-T ovarian cancer therapeutics are in their early stages of development, and we still must establish and implement many important functions necessary to commercialize the technologies.\nAccordingly, you should consider the Company\u2019s prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their pre-revenue generating stages, particularly those in the biotechnology field. Shareholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a business with no operating history will face. In particular, shareholders should consider that there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:\n\u00b7 demonstrate the effectiveness of Cchek\u2122;\n\u00b7 successfully complete studies necessary to submit an IND application to the FDA for our ovarian cancer therapeutic;\n\u00b7 implement or execute our current business plan, or that our current business plan is sound;\n\u00b7 raise sufficient funds in the capital markets or otherwise to fully effectuate our business plan;\n\u00b7 maintain our management team, including the members of our scientific advisory board;\n\u00b7 determine that the processes and technologies that we have developed or will develop are commercially viable; and/or\n\u00b7 attract, enter into or maintain contracts with potential commercial partners such as licensors of technology and suppliers.\nAny of the foregoing risks may adversely affect the Company and result in the failure of our business. In addition, we expect to encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. Over the next several quarters, we will need to transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting clinical trials and commercial activities. We may not be able to reach such achievements, which would have a material adverse effect on our Company.\nOur current business model, as it relates to both Cchek\u2122 and our CAR-T cancer therapeutics, relies on strategic collaborations with commercial partners to provide the resources and infrastructure to manufacture and ultimately market and/or sell our technologies. We may have difficulty in timing the establishment of these partnerships to achieve the greatest economic benefit for the Company, or in establishing these partnerships at all.\nWe do not currently have the resources and infrastructure to manufacture, market or sell our technologies. While our technologies have generated interest from multiple potential strategic partners, due to the early stage of development of our technologies, we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish any strategic partnerships. Further, even if we elect to engage with a potential strategic partner, development of these partnerships can take an extended period of time in which significant analysis is performed by the potential strategic partner on our technologies and our intellectual property, as well as on the market opportunities and how well our technologies may fit strategically with the partner\u2019s existing business. Accordingly, it will be difficult for us to time the establishment of a strategic partnership to achieve the greatest economic benefit for the Company.\nWe may have difficulty in raising capital for our cancer diagnostics and therapeutics businesses and may consume resources faster than expected.\nWe currently do not generate any revenue from Cchek\u00d4 or our ovarian cancer therapeutic nor do we generate any other recurring revenues and as of October 31, 2018, the Company only had approximately $5,056,000 in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Therefore, we have a limited source of cash to meet our future capital requirements, which may include the expensive process of obtaining FDA approvals for our ovarian cancer therapeutic and for Cchek\u00d4 for each type of cancer for which we desire to launch a diagnostic test. We do not expect to generate significant revenues for the foreseeable future, and we may not be able to raise funds in the future, which would leave us without resources to continue our operations and force us to resort to the Company raising additional capital in the form of equity or debt financings, which may not be available to us. We may have difficulty raising needed capital in the near or longer term as a result of, among other factors, the very early stage of our diagnostic business and our lack of revenues as well as the inherent business risks associated with an early stage, biotechnology company and present and future market conditions. Also, we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding sooner than anticipated. Our inability to raise funds could lead to decreases in the price of our common stock and the failure of our cancer diagnostic and therapeutic businesses which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection, our competitive position will be harmed.\nOur ability to compete and to achieve sustained profitability will be impacted by our ability to protect our Cchek\u00d4 cancer diagnostic technologies, our CAR-T cancer therapeutics technologies and other proprietary discoveries and technologies. We expect to rely on a combination of patent protection, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and regulatory approvals to protect Cchek\u00d4, our CAR-T cancer therapeutics and any of our other technologies. Our intellectual property strategy is intended to help develop and maintain our competitive position. While we have been granted two patents related to Cchek\u00d4, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain further patent protection for Cchek\u00d4, our CAR-T cancer therapeutics and any other technologies, nor can we be certain that the steps we will have taken will prevent the misappropriation and unauthorized use of our technologies. If we are not able to obtain and maintain patent protection our competitive position may be harmed.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our Cchek\u00d4 cancer diagnostic technologies, our CAR-T therapeutics, and other proprietary discoveries and technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights or intellectual property of third parties. We may become party to, or be threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our Cchek\u00d4 cancer diagnostic technologies, our CAR-T therapeutics, and other proprietary discoveries and technologies. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third-party's intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to continue developing our Cchek\u00d4 cancer diagnostic technologies, our CAR-T therapeutics, and other proprietary discoveries and technologies. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties can have a similar negative impact on our business.\nIf we cannot license rights to use technologies on reasonable terms, we may not be able to commercialize new products in the future.\nIn the future, we may identify third-party technology we need, including to develop or commercialize new products or services. In return for the use of a third party\u2019s technology, we may agree to pay the licensor royalties based on sales of our products or services. Royalties are a component of cost of products or services and affect the margins on our products or services. We may also need to negotiate licenses to patents or patent applications before or after introducing a commercial product. We may not be able to obtain necessary licenses to patents or patent applications, and our business may suffer if we are unable to enter into the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all, if any necessary licenses are subsequently terminated, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the licenses or fail to prevent infringement by third parties, or if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable.\nRisks Related to Cchek\u00d4\nWhile our Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic technology has shown favorable results from initial testing, we cannot guarantee that these results will be replicated in future testing nor can we guarantee the success of the technology at all.\nWe have initially used Cchek\u00d4 to test the blood of small groups of individuals consisting of cancer patients and healthy patients and have in some studies reported sensitivity and specificity of over 90%. While these preliminary results far exceed existing diagnostic testing, there is no guarantee that these results will be replicable when we test a larger group of patients or at all. If we are unable to consistently attain results that are necessary for commercialization of Cchek\u00d4, our diagnostic technology will not have any monetary value and we will be unable to generate any revenue from this technology.\nEven if we are able to attain results necessary for the commercialization of Cchek\u00d4, our ability to commercialize the technology in the future will depend on our ability to provide evidence of clinical utility.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize Cchek\u00d4 will depend on numerous factors, including whether health care providers believe that Cchek\u00d4 provides sufficient incremental clinical utility; whether the medical community accepts that Cchek\u00d4 has sufficient sensitivity (there are no or very few false positives), specificity (detects the cancer the test is supposed to detect) and predictive value to be meaningful in patient care and treatment decisions; whether the cost of the test is reasonably priced and commercially viable; and whether health insurers, government health programs and other third-party payers will cover and pay for Cchek\u00d4 and the amount that they will reimburse for such tests. These factors may present obstacles to commercial acceptance of Cchek\u00d4. To the extent these obstacles arise, we will need to devote substantial time and resources to overcome these obstacles, and we might not be successful. Failure to achieve market acceptance of Cchek\u00d4 would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are unable to give any assurance that we will be successful in providing sufficient evidence of clinical utility or any assurance that we will have adequate managerial, technical or financial resources to support the studies necessary to provide sufficient evidence of clinical utility of Cchek\u00d4 or to adequately differentiate our test from other diagnostic products in the manner, timeframe or cost parameters we anticipate, if at all. If we are unable to provide evidence of clinical utility and differentiate Cchek\u00d4, we will not be able to generate the revenues and market growth that we seek. Our failure to generate revenue from the sale of our products would materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDiagnostic test development involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may be unable to commercialize Cchek\u00d4 on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe have devoted considerable resources to research and development for Cchek\u00d4, however there can be no assurance that Cchek\u00d4 will be capable of reliably predicting the occurrence or recurrence of any cancers with the sensitivity and specificity necessary to be clinically and commercially useful, or, even if such technology is clinically and commercially useful, that it will result in commercially successful products. In addition, before we can fully develop Cchek\u00d4 and commercialize any new products, we will need to:\n\u00b7 conduct substantial research and development;\n\u00b7 conduct validation studies;\n\u00b7 expend significant funds;\n\u00b7 enter into agreements and maintain relationships with third party vendors to provide third party blood samples;\n\u00b7 obtain regulatory approval (either CLIA, FDA or both); and\n\u00b7 depending on which regulatory pathway we select, establish or contract with the owner of a CLIA certified laboratory to process test samples.\nAccordingly, our product development process involves a high degree of risk and may take several years, especially if the Company seeks FDA approval for each of its diagnostic tests. If Cchek\u00d4 should fail at the research or development stage, not produce sufficient clinical validation data to support the effectiveness of the product or not gain regulatory approval or if we should run out of cash to devote towards the commercialization of the technology or fail to establish agreements with necessary third party vendors, we will not be able to commercialize Cchek\u00d4 and we will not generate any revenue from the technology.\nIf we fail to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our Cchek\u00d4 technology, and our ability to generate revenue and the viability of our Company will be materially impaired.\nCommercialization of Cchek\u00d4 will require that we obtain either CLIA certification, FDA approval or both. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for Cchek\u00d4, we will be unable to commercialize and generate revenue from the technology which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUntil we obtain FDA approval for Cchek\u00d4, and unless we establish a CLIA certified laboratory, we will be dependent on laboratory contractors for testing of patient samples that are essential to the development and validation of Cchek\u00d4.\nTo pursue the development and validation of Cchek\u00d4, we will require access to test results obtained from patient blood samples. We have currently contracted with Wistar to provide these services. Unless and until Cchek\u00d4 receives FDA approval, or we establish our own CLIA certified laboratory, we will continue to be dependent on contractors or collaborators such as Wistar for testing of patient blood samples to develop and validate Cchek\u00d4.\nWe will be dependent on third parties for the patient samples that are essential to the development and validation of Cchek\u00d4.\nTo pursue our development and validation of Cchek\u00d4, we will need access, over time, to patient blood samples and such patients will need to consent to the use of their blood. As a result, we have made arrangements with hospitals and medical practices to give us access to patient samples for the development and validation of Cchek\u00d4. In the event that we are unable to obtain patient samples, or access to patient samples becomes more limited due to changes in privacy laws governing the use and disclosure of medical information or due to changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain patient samples and associated information, our ability to pursue the development of Cchek\u00d4 may be slowed or halted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, the law or regulations of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or the FDA or other federal, state or local agencies.\nWe will need to seek regulatory approval in order to market Cchek\u00d4. The clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories (regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiring that they be certified under federal law. CLIA does not pre-empt state law, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties. The FDA regulates diagnostic products and periodically inspects and reviews their manufacturing processes and product performance. We may choose to seek FDA approval for one or more Cchek\u00d4 tests, as opposed to seeking CLIA certification. We cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly, including FDA regulation of laboratory developed tests.\nHealth insurers and other third-party payers may decide not to reimburse our Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic testing or may provide inadequate reimbursement, which could jeopardize our commercial prospects and require customers to pay for the tests out of pocket.\nIn the United States, the regulatory process that allows diagnostic tests to be marketed is independent of any coverage determinations made by third-party payers. For new diagnostic tests, private and government payers decide whether to cover the test, the reimbursement amount for a covered test and the specific conditions for reimbursement. Physicians may order diagnostic tests that are not reimbursed by third-party payers, but coverage determinations and reimbursement levels and conditions are critical to the commercial success of a diagnostic product. Each third-party payer makes its own decision about which tests it will cover and how much it will pay, although many payers will follow the lead of Medicare. As a result, the coverage determination process will be a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific, clinical and economic support for the use of Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic testing to each payer separately, with no assurance that approval will be obtained. If third-party payers decide not to cover Cchek\u00d4 or if they offer inadequate payment amounts, our ability to generate revenue from Cchek\u00d4 could be limited since patients who want to take the diagnostic tests would have to pay for it out of pocket. Even if one or more third-party payers decide to reimburse for Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic testing, a third-party payer may stop or lower payment at any time, which could reduce revenue. We cannot predict whether third-party payers will cover Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic testing or offer adequate reimbursement. We also cannot predict the timing of such decisions. In addition, physicians or patients may decide not to order Cchek\u00d4 tests if third-party payments are inadequate, especially if ordering the test could result in financial liability for the patient.\nWhether or not health insurers and other third-party payers decide to reimburse Cchek\u00d4, the technology may cost patients more than we anticipate.\nWe believe that our Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic testing will significantly reduce the cost to patients of screening and confirmatory testing for certain types of cancer. If, however, the cost to utilize Cchek\u00d4 is more expensive than we anticipate, many patients and third-party payers may elect not to utilize the technology which would significantly impact our ability to generate revenue on the technology.\nWe operate in a competitive market and expect to face intense competition, often from companies with greater resources and experience than us.\nThe clinical diagnostics industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. We are aware of many different types of diagnostic tests available to detect cancer that are currently in use or being developed and many more types of diagnostic tests may be developed in the future. If we are able to successfully commercialize Cchek\u00d4, all of these tests will compete with our product. If Cchek\u00d4 is more expensive than and/or does not have sufficient specificity, sensitivity or predictive value to compete with tests that are currently on the market, or if any other diagnostic tests that are under development, once successfully developed and commercialized, have greater specificity, sensitivity or predictive value and/or are cheaper than our technology, we may be unable to compete successfully with such products which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, as the industry continues to expand and evolve, an increasing number of competitors and potential competitors may enter the market. Many of these competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than we do. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have more experience than we do in the development of diagnostic products, including validation procedures and regulatory matters. In addition, Cchek\u00d4 will compete with product offerings from large and well established companies that have greater marketing and sales experience and capabilities than we do. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to sustain and grow our revenue.\nWe are dependent upon a few key personnel and the loss of their services could adversely affect us.\nOur future success of developing Cchek\u00d4 will depend on the efforts of the inventor of the technology, our President and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Amit Kumar. We do not have an employment agreement with Dr. Kumar which means that Dr. Kumar does not have a set term of employment and may renegotiate his employment arrangement with the Company at any time. Further, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on Dr. Kumar. The loss of the services of Dr. Kumar could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to our CAR-T therapeutics\nBiopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of uncertainty. We have never generated any revenue from biopharmaceutical product sales and our biopharmaceutical products may never be profitable.\nWe are in the pre-clinical stage of developing our CAR-T therapeutics technology. Our ability to generate revenue depends in large part on our ability, alone or with partners, to successfully complete the development of, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for, and commercialize, product candidates. We do not anticipate generating revenues from sales of such products for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales of our CAR-T therapeutics technology depends heavily on our success in:\n\u00b7 progressing our pre-clinical programs into human clinical trials;\n\u00b7 completing requisite clinical trials through all phases of clinical development of our ovarian cancer therapy and other potential product candidates;\n\u00b7 seeking and obtaining marketing approvals for our ovarian cancer therapy and other potential product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;\n\u00b7 launching and commercializing our ovarian cancer therapy and other potential product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, if any, with a partner or, if launched independently, successfully establishing a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u00b7 identifying and developing new product candidates;\n\u00b7 establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties;\n\u00b7 maintaining, protecting, expanding and enforcing our intellectual property; and\n\u00b7 attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biologic product development, we are unable to predict the likelihood or timing for when we may receive regulatory approval of our ovarian cancer therapy and any other potential product candidates or when we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability, if ever. If we are unable to establish a development and or commercialization partnership, or do not receive regulatory approvals, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Even if we or a partner obtain the regulatory approvals to market and sell one or more of our product candidates, we may never generate significant revenues from any commercial sales for several reasons, including because the market for our products may be smaller than we anticipate, or products may not be adopted by physicians and payors or because our products may not be as efficacious or safe as other treatment options. If we fail to successfully commercialize one or more products, by ourselves or through a partner, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nCAR-T cell therapies are novel and present significant challenges.\nCAR-T product candidates represent a relatively new field of cellular immunotherapy. Advancing this novel and personalized therapy creates significant challenges for us, or a partner, including:\n\u00b7 obtaining regulatory approval, as the FDA and other regulatory authorities have limited experience with commercial development of T-cell therapies for cancer;\n\u00b7 sourcing clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process our product candidates;\n\u00b7 developing a consistent and reliable process, while limiting contamination risks, for engineering and manufacturing T cells ex vivo and infusing the engineered T cells into the patient;\n\u00b7 educating medical personnel regarding the potential safety benefits, as well as the challenges, of incorporating our product candidates into their treatment regimens;\n\u00b7 establishing sales and marketing capabilities upon obtaining any regulatory approval to gain market acceptance of a novel therapy; and\n\u00b7 the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for our novel and personalized therapy.\nOur inability to successfully develop CAR-T cell therapies or develop processes related to the manufacture, sales and marketing of these therapies would adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.\nWhile CAR-T technology has shown positive results in B-cell cancers by others, its safety and efficacy has not been seen in solid tumors and we cannot guarantee our CAR-T technology will be safe or effective in ovarian cancer.\nCAR-T therapies function through the binding of a genetically engineered killer T-cell to a cancer cell. However, these engineered T-cells destroy the cell they are bound to whether it is a cancer cell or a healthy cell. Therefore, the engineered T-cells must be designed to only bind to cancer cells to minimize toxicity. Our CAR-T technology relies on the natural affinity of FSH to FSH-Receptor. Research by others has shown that in women the FSH-Receptor protein is found on ovary cells and generally in no other healthy tissue, and therefore, we engineer our T-cells with FSH. However, as the research in this field is still new, we cannot guarantee that there is no FSH-Receptor on any other healthy tissue in the human body.\nWhile our CAR-T technology has shown favorable results from in-vitro and in-vivo testing, including in large numbers of animals under the Good Laboratory Practice (\u201cGLP\u201d) conditions necessary for inclusion in an IND application, we cannot guarantee that these results will be sufficient for the FDA to allow us to commence human clinical trials.\nWhile studies have generated promising results in large numbers of mice under GLP conditions, and toxicity studies have been performed and have had favorable results, there can be no assurance that the FDA will find these results sufficient to allow us to commence testing of our ovarian cancer therapy in human patients. If we are unable to commence human clinical trials, or if commencement of such trials is significantly delayed, we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWhile pre-clinical testing of our ovarian cancer CAR-T therapy has been positive, we may experience unfavorable results once we commence human clinical trials.\nWe have not initiated clinical trials for our ovarian cancer therapy and we may not be able to commence clinical trials on the time frames we expect. As this product candidate has only been tested in animals, we face significant uncertainty regarding how effective and safe it will be in human patients and the results from preclinical studies may not be indicative of the results of clinical trials. Preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products.\nEven if clinical trials are successfully completed, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not interpret the results as we do, and more clinical trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. To the extent that the results of our clinical trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, approval of our product candidates may be significantly delayed, or we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional clinical trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates.\nWe are dependent on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials.\nMoffitt is performing the necessary pre-clinical studies to file an IND application to begin human clinical testing of our ovarian cancer therapeutic and will perform the clinical trials. Unless or until we have an in-house scientific team to perform and manage these studies, we will remain reliant on Moffitt or other third parties for these services.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trial, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nEven if we are permitted to conduct clinical trials for our product candidate, we may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trial for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the study until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the patient eligibility criteria defined in the clinical trial protocol;\n\u00b7 the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u00b7 the proximity of patients to the study site;\n\u00b7 the design of the clinical trial;\n\u00b7 our ability to retain clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u00b7 the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the clinical trials before completion; and\n\u00b7 competing clinical trials and approved therapies available for patients.\nIn particular, our clinical trial will look to enroll patients with late stage ovarian cancer who have failed conventional treatment. Our clinical trial will compete with other companies' clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic area as our product candidate, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our clinical trial may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. We expect to conduct our clinical trial at the same clinical trial site that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trial in this clinical trial site. Moreover, because our product candidate represents a departure from more commonly used methods for cancer treatment, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use experimental therapies that use conventional technologies, such as chemotherapy and antibody therapy, rather than enroll patients in our future clinical trial. Patients may also be unwilling to participate in our clinical trial because of negative publicity from adverse events in the biotechnology or gene therapy industries.\nDelays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our planned clinical trial, which could prevent completion of the clinical trial and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our ovarian cancer CAR-T therapy.\nAny adverse developments that occur during any clinical trials conducted by academic investigators, our collaborators or other entities conducting clinical trials under independent INDs may negatively affect the conduct of our clinical trial or our ability to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidate.\nCAR-T and other immuno-therapy technologies are being used by third parties in clinical trials for which we are collaborating or in clinical trials which are completely independent of our development programs. We have little to no control over the conduct of those clinical trials. If serious adverse events occur during these or any other clinical trials using technologies similar to ours, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may delay our clinical trial, or could delay, limit or deny approval of our product candidate or require us to conduct additional clinical trials as a condition to marketing approval, which would increase our costs. If we receive regulatory approval for any product candidate and a new and serious safety issue is identified in connection with clinical trials conducted by third parties, the applicable regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or otherwise restrict our ability to market and sell our product. In addition, treating physicians may be less willing to administer our product due to concerns over such adverse events, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product.\nAdverse side effects or other safety risks associated with our ovarian cancer therapy could cause us to suspend or discontinue clinical trials or delay or preclude approval.\nIn third party clinical trials involving CAR-T cell therapies, the most prominent acute toxicities included symptoms thought to be associated with the release of cytokines, such as fever, low blood pressure and kidney dysfunction. Some patients also experienced toxicity of the central nervous system, such as confusion, cranial nerve dysfunction and speech impairment. Adverse side effects attributed to CAR-T therapies were severe and life-threatening in some patients. The life-threatening events were related to kidney dysfunction and toxicities of the central nervous system. Severe and life-threatening toxicities occurred primarily in the first two weeks after cell infusion and generally resolved within three weeks. In the past, several patients have also died in clinical trials by others involving CAR-T cells.\nUndesirable side effects observed in our clinical trial, whether or not they are caused by our product candidate, could result in the delay, suspension or termination of clinical trials, by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for a number of reasons. In addition, because the patients who will be enrolled in our clinical trial are suffering from a life-threatening disease and will often be suffering from multiple complicating conditions it may be difficult to accurately assess the relationship between our product candidate and adverse events experienced by very ill patients. If we elect or are required to delay, suspend or terminate a clinical trial of our ovarian cancer therapy, the commercial prospects of such therapy will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from such therapy will be delayed or eliminated. In addition, serious adverse events observed in clinical trials could hinder or prevent market acceptance of the product candidate at issue. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations significantly.\nClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement.\nHuman clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. Because our CAR-T ovarian cancer therapy is based on relatively new technology and engineered on a patient-by-patient basis, we expect that it will require extensive research and development and have substantial manufacturing and processing costs. In addition, costs to treat patients with relapsed/refractory cancer and to treat potential side effects that may result from therapies such as our current and future product candidates can be significant. Accordingly, our clinical trial costs are likely to be significantly higher than for more conventional therapeutic technologies or drug products. In addition, our proposed personalized product candidates involve several complex and costly manufacturing and processing steps, the costs of which will be borne by us. The costs of our clinical trials may increase if the FDA does not agree with our clinical development plans or requires us to conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates.\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and well-established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug or biologic products that are more effective, safer, more easily commercialized or less costly than our product candidates or may develop proprietary technologies or secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products.\nWe rely on a license from Wistar for our CAR-T technology, and if we lose this license we may be subjected to future litigation.\nWe are party to a royalty-bearing license agreement that grants us rights to use certain intellectual property, including patents and patent applications. We may need to obtain additional licenses from others to advance our research, development and commercialization activities. Our license agreement imposes, and we expect that future license agreements if necessary will impose, various development, diligence, commercialization and other obligations on us.\nIn spite of our efforts, our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our obligations under such license agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to develop and commercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors or other third parties might have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours and we may be required to cease our development and commercialization activities. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nMoreover, disputes may arise with respect to any one of our licensing agreements, including:\n\u00b7 the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u00b7 the extent to which our product candidates, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u00b7 the sublicensing of patent and other rights under the licensing agreement and our collaborative development relationships;\n\u00b7 our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u00b7 the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and\n\u00b7 the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf we do not prevail in such disputes, we may lose any of such license agreements.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nOur failure to maintain such licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any of these licenses could be terminated, such as if either party fails to abide by the terms of the license, or if the licensor fails to prevent infringement by third parties or if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable. Absent the license agreements, we may infringe patents subject to those agreements, and if the license agreements are terminated, we may be subject to litigation by the licensor. Litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we do not prevail, we may be required to pay damages, including treble damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and expenses, royalties or, be enjoined from selling our products, which could adversely affect our ability to offer products, our ability to continue operations and our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Legacy Patent Licensing Activities\nIn connection with our legacy patent licensing activities, we may not be able to license our patent portfolios which may have an adverse impact on our future operations.\nWe may generate revenues and related cash flows from the licensing and enforcement of patents that we currently own and from the rights to license and enforce additional patents we have obtained from third parties. However, we can give no assurances that we will be able to identify opportunities to exploit such patents or that such opportunities, even if identified, will generate sufficient revenues to sustain future operations.\nWe, in certain circumstances, rely on representations, warranties and opinions made by third parties that, if determined to be false or inaccurate, may expose us to certain material liabilities.\nFrom time to time, we may rely upon the opinions of purported experts. In certain instances, we may not have the opportunity to independently investigate and verify the facts upon which such opinions are made. By relying on these opinions, we may be exposed to liabilities in connection with the licensing and enforcement of certain patents and patent rights which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn connection with patent licensing activities conducted by certain of our subsidiaries, a court that has ruled unfavorably against us may also impose sanctions or award attorney\u2019s fees, exposing us and our operating subsidiaries to certain material liabilities.\nIn connection with any of our patent licensing activities, it is possible that a court that has ruled against us may also impose sanctions or award attorney\u2019s fees to defendants, exposing us or our operating subsidiaries to material liabilities, which could materially harm our operating results and our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe issuance or sale of shares in the future to raise money or for strategic purposes could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for operations, to pay down then existing indebtedness, as consideration for the acquisition of assets, as consideration for receipt of goods or services, to pay for the development of our Cchek\u00d4 platform, to pay for the development of our CAR-T cancer therapeutics and for acquisitions of companies. We have and in the future may issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute stockholders' ownership interests in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.\nAny actual or anticipated sales of shares by our stockholders may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our stockholders, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nDelaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.\nProvisions of Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) and our certificate of incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d), and By-Laws, could make the acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and the removal of incumbent officers and directors, more difficult. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a merger with a 15%-or-greater stockholder, such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer, until three years after that party became a 15%-or-greater stockholder;\n\u00b7 the authorization in our Certificate of Incorporation of undesignated preferred stock, which could be issued without stockholder approval in a manner designed to prevent or discourage a takeover;\n\u00b7 provisions in our By-Laws establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7 provisions in our By-Laws regarding stockholders' rights to call a special meeting of stockholders limit such rights to stockholders of record holding together at least 66 2/3% of shares of the Company entitled to vote at the meeting, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our Board of Directors or to vote to repeal any of the anti-takeover provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.\nTogether, these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that could otherwise involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in quarterly operating results, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur reported revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, specifically as we continue to devote more of our resources towards our Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic technology and our CAR-T cancer therapeutics. It is possible that in future periods, we will have no revenue or, in any event, revenues could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The following are among the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period:\n\u00b7 clinical trial results relating to our diagnostic technology;\n\u00b7 pre-clinical testing results relating to our CAR-T cancer therapeutics;\n\u00b7 clinical trial results relating to our CAR-T cancer therapeutics;\n\u00b7 progress with regulatory authorities towards the certification/approval of our diagnostic technology or our CAR-T cancer therapeutics;\n\u00b7 costs related to acquisitions, alliances and licenses.\nBiotechnology company stock prices are especially volatile, and this volatility may depress the price of our common stock.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and the market prices of biotechnology companies have been highly volatile. We believe that various factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, among others, the following:\n\u00b7 announcements of developments in the cancer diagnostic testing industry or in the field of CAR-T therapeutics;\n\u00b7 developments in relationships with third party vendors and laboratories;\n\u00b7 announcements of developments in our remaining patent enforcement actions;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning our patents and other intellectual property;\n\u00b7 our or our competitors' technological innovations;\n\u00b7 variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 our failure to meet or exceed securities analysts' expectations of our financial results;\n\u00b7 a change in financial estimates or securities analysts' recommendations;\n\u00b7 changes in management's or securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents; and\n\u00b7 the timing of or our failure to complete significant transactions.\nIn addition, we believe that fluctuations in our stock price during applicable periods can also be impacted by changes in governmental regulations in the diagnostic testing and drug development industries and/or court rulings and/or other developments in our remaining patent licensing and enforcement actions. For example, if government regulators no longer allow for the use of diagnostic technology that has not been granted FDA approval (e.g. denying products that have only received CLIA certification), the time and cost to bring our technology to market will increase which will likely have an adverse impact on our stock price.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation. If our common stock was the object of securities class action litigation due to volatility in the market price of our stock, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially harm our business and financial results.\nOur common stock is currently listed on NASDAQ Capital Market, however if our common stock is delisted for any reason, it will become subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules which may make our shares more difficult to sell.\nIf our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock will then fit the definition of a penny stock and therefore would be subject to the rules adopted by the SEC regulating broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. The SEC rules may have the effect of reducing trading activity in our common stock making it more difficult for investors to sell their shares. The SEC\u2019s rules require a broker or dealer proposing to effect a transaction in a penny stock to deliver the customer a risk disclosure document that provides certain information prescribed by the SEC, including, but not limited to, the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker or dealer must also disclose the aggregate amount of any compensation received or receivable by him in connection with such transaction prior to consummating the transaction. In addition, the SEC\u2019s rules also require a broker or dealer to make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction before completion of the transaction. The existence of the SEC\u2019s rules may result in a lower trading volume of our common stock and lower trading prices.\nWe have issued a significant number of securities pursuant to our incentive plans and may continue to do so in the future. The vesting and, if applicable, exercise of these securities and the sale of the shares of common stock issuable thereunder may dilute your percentage ownership interest and may also result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock.\nAs of the date of this report, we have issued and outstanding options to purchase 7,405,868 shares of our common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $2.75 and 1,500,000 restricted stock awards (including options to purchase 1,500,000 shares of our common stock and a restricted stock award of 1,500,000 shares of our common stock that vest based upon achievement of certain stock price based milestones issued to Dr. Kumar in May 2018). Further, as of the date of this report, our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee have the authority to issue awards totaling an additional 2,800,000 shares of our common stock (not including any additional shares of common stock that will be available for issuance pursuant to the evergreen provisions in our 2010 Share Incentive Plan and our 2018 Share Incentive Plan on the first business day of the 2020 calendar year as described in more detail herein). Additionally, we have registered for resale all of the shares of common stock issuable under our incentive plans. Because the market for our common stock is thinly traded, the sales and/or the perception that those sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the mere existence of a significant number of shares of common stock issuable upon vesting and, if applicable, exercise of these securities may be perceived by the market as having a potential dilutive effect, which could lead to a decrease in the price of our common stock.\nU.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us and holders of our common stock.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, originally known as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d which significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code. The new legislation, among other things, changes the U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows the expensing of capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system. Additionally, the legislation imposes a reduction to the maximum deduction allowed for NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, but allows such NOLs to be carried forward indefinitely. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on us. The impact of this tax reform, or of any future administrative guidance interpreting provisions thereof, on holders of our shares is uncertain and could be adverse. This annual report does not discuss any such tax legislation or the manner in which it might affect holders of our shares. We urge holders of our shares to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to any such legislation and the potential tax consequences of their ownership of our shares.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock which may adversely impact the market price of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and any earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable to you because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.", "PERMNO": 27167, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ANIX"}
