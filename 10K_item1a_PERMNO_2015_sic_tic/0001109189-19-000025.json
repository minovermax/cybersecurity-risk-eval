RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the important factors that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in our forward-looking statements. We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business depends on domestic spending by the oil and natural gas industry, and this spending and our business has been in the past, and may in the future be, adversely affected by industry and financial market conditions that are beyond our control.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. Customers\u2019 expectations for lower market prices for oil and natural gas, as well as the availability of capital for operating and capital expenditures, may cause them to curtail spending, thereby reducing demand for our services and equipment.\nIndustry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries and merger, acquisition and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers. Activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas may adversely affect the ability of certain of our customers to conduct operations. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry, environmental and other governmental regulations regarding the exploration for and production and development of oil and natural gas reserves, and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity could adversely impact the level of drilling and workover activity by some of our customers. This reduction may cause a decline in the demand for our services or adversely affect the price of our services. In addition, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas also may have a negative long-term impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices, to the extent existing production is not replaced and the number of producing wells for us to service declines.\nOil and gas industry pricing remained relatively stable through the middle of 2014. From the second half of 2014 through 2016, oil and natural gas prices declined significantly, due in large part to increasing supplies and weakening demand growth. Although oil prices increased from 2017 into 2018, they have since declined towards the end of 2018 and into 2019. Natural gas prices have been depressed for a prolonged period and utilization and pricing for our services in our natural gas-based operating areas have remained challenged. Oil and gas prices may remain lower for the foreseeable future.\nLimitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause oil and natural gas producers to make further reductions to capital budgets in the future even if oil or natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending will curtail drilling programs as well as discretionary spending on well services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge and our utilization. In addition, certain of our customers could become unable to pay their suppliers, including us. Any of these conditions or events could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, or if oil or natural gas prices remain low or decline further, the demand for our services could be adversely affected.\nThe demand for our services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related general production spending and level of drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in oil or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil or natural gas prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells or lower production spending on existing wells. This, in turn, could result in lower demand for our services and may cause lower rates and lower utilization of our well service equipment. If oil or natural gas prices continue to remain low or decline further, or if there is a reduction in drilling activities, the demand for our services and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nPrices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. The Cushing WTI Spot Oil Price averaged $50.88 and $64.94 per bbl in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The Cushing WTI oil prices\nhave declined from over $107 per bbl in June 2014 to $45.15 per bbl on December 28, 2018. The Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price averaged $2.99 and $3.17 per Mcf for 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nCompetition within the well services industry may adversely affect our ability to market our services.\nThe well services industry is highly competitive and fragmented and includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, as well as several large companies that have longer operating histories, possess substantially greater financial, technological and other resources and have greater name recognition in certain operating areas than we do. Our larger competitors\u2019 greater resources could allow those competitors to compete more effectively than we can. The amount of equipment available may exceed demand, which could result in active price competition. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. In addition, adverse market conditions lower demand for well servicing equipment, which results in excess equipment and lower utilization rates. If adverse oil and natural gas market conditions persist or deteriorate further, our utilization rates may decline.\nFuel conservation measures could reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which would in turn reduce the demand for our services.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation, and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar geothermal, tidal and biofuels) could reduce demand for hydrocarbons and therefore for our services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues.\nWe may require additional capital in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash internally or obtain alternative sources of capital on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to fund capital expenditures, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe anticipate we will need to make substantial capital investments in the future to purchase additional equipment to expand our services, refurbish our well servicing rigs and replace existing equipment including idled equipment brought back into service as activity levels improved. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we invested approximately $63.4 million in cash for capital expenditures and $67.5 million of capital leases. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we invested approximately $68.7 million in cash for capital expenditures and $20.2 million of capital leases. For 2019, we have currently budgeted $94.1 million for capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, including $15.6 million for capital leases. Historically, we have financed these investments through internally generated funds, debt and equity offerings, our capital lease program and borrowings under our credit facilities. Please read Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for more information.\nOur significant capital investments require cash that we could otherwise apply to other business needs. However, if we do not incur these expenditures while our competitors make substantial fleet investments, our market share may decline and our business may be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash internally or obtain alternative sources of capital to fund our proposed capital expenditures and acquisitions, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders may result. Adverse changes in the capital markets could make it difficult to obtain additional capital or obtain it at attractive rates. If we are unable to maintain or obtain access to capital, we could experience a reduction of liquidity and may result in difficulty funding our operations, repayment of short-term borrowings, payments of interest and other obligations.\nOur future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges.\nWe have recorded goodwill impairment charges and asset impairment charges in the past. We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our property and equipment, and intangible assets. If any indication of impairment for our long lived assets exists, we project future cash flows on an undiscounted basis for other long-lived assets, and compare these cash flows to the carrying amount of the related assets. These cash flow projections are based on our current operating plans, estimates and judgmental assumptions. We perform the assessment of potential impairment for our long-lived assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable due to various external or internal factors. If we determine that our estimates of future cash flows were inaccurate or our actual results are materially different from what we have predicted, we could record additional impairment charges in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have operated at a loss in the past, and there is no assurance of our profitability in the future.\nHistorically, we have experienced periods of low demand for our services and have incurred operating losses. In the future, we may not be able to reduce our costs, increase our revenues, or reduce our debt service obligations sufficient to achieve or maintain profitability and generate positive operating income. Under such circumstances, we may incur further operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow.\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total outstanding debt of $349.7 million, net of discount and deferred financing costs, including $300.0 million of aggregate principal amount due under the Senior Notes, capital lease obligations in the aggregate amount of $60.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, Basic had $39.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility, giving Basic $69.6 million of available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, we made cash interest payments totaling $25.6 million and $35.1 million, respectively.\nOur current and future indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022impair our ability to make investments and obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business, our industry or the economy in general as a substantial portion of our operating cash flow will be required to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, making it more difficult to react to changes in our business and in industry and market conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing that may be necessary to operate or expand our business;\n\u2022limit management's flexibility in operating our business;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business or industry;\n\u2022put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to interest rate increases to the extent that we incur variable rate indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain the funds required to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in instruments governing any existing or future indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of such instruments. In the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed under those instruments to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest, secured lenders could foreclose on any of our assets securing their loans and we or one or more of our subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our indebtedness is accelerated, or we enter into bankruptcy, we may be unable to pay all of our indebtedness in full. Any of the foregoing consequences could restrict our ability to grow our business and cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nOur New ABL Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our Senior Notes impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business.\nOur New ABL Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our Senior Notes impose limitations on our ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u2022limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness;\n\u2022restrictions on mergers, sales or transfers of assets without the lenders\u2019 consent; and\n\u2022limitations on dividends and distributions.\nIn addition, our New ABL Credit Agreement, our indenture and our current and future indebtedness may require us to maintain certain financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial conditions, some of which become more restrictive over time and may require us to reduce our debt or take some other action in order to comply with them. The failure to comply with any of these financial conditions, including the financial ratios or covenants, would cause a default under our New ABL Credit Agreement, our indenture or future indebtedness. A default under any of our indebtedness, if not waived, could result in the acceleration of such indebtedness or other indebtedness, in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. In addition, a default or acceleration of any of our indebtedness under any of our indebtedness could result in a default under or acceleration of other indebtedness with cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. In the event of any acceleration of our indebtedness, we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it, and any holders of secured\nindebtedness may seek to foreclose on the assets securing such indebtedness. Even if new financing is available, it may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us. These restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We also may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our New ABL Credit Agreement, our indenture or future indebtedness or existing limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, including in connection with acquisitions. Please read Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facility\u201d for a discussion of our New ABL Credit Agreement.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our New ABL Facility bear interest at variable rates, exposing us to interest rate risk. If the interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed would remain the same, and our results of operations and cash flows for servicing our indebtedness would decrease.\nOur operations are subject to inherent risks, including operational hazards and cyber-attacks. These risks may be self-insured, or may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, blowouts, explosions, craters, fires and oil spills. These conditions can cause:\n\u2022personal injury or loss of life;\n\u2022damage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment; and\n\u2022suspension of operations.\nThe occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the well services industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are being used may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nAs is customary in our industry, our service contracts generally provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our customers from any claims arising from personal injury or death of our employees, damage to or loss of our equipment, and pollution emanating from our equipment and services. Similarly, our customers agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from personal injury or death of their employees, damage to or loss of their equipment, and pollution caused from their equipment or the well reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir). Our indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case. For example, from time to time we may enter into contracts with less favorable indemnities or perform work without a contract that protects us. In addition, our indemnification rights may not fully protect us if the customer is insolvent or becomes bankrupt, does not maintain adequate insurance or otherwise does not possess sufficient resources to indemnify us. In addition, our indemnification rights may be held unenforceable in some jurisdictions. Our inability to fully realize the benefits of our contractual indemnification protections could result in significant liabilities and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain insurance coverage that we believe to be customary in the industry against many of these hazards. However, we do not have insurance against all foreseeable risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. As such, not all of our property is insured. We are also self-insured up to retention limits with regard to workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, and medical and dental coverage. We maintain accruals in our consolidated balance sheets related to self-insurance retentions by using third-party data and historical claims history. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against, or the failure of an insurer to meet its insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, it may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could rise significantly in the future so as to make such insurance prohibitively expensive. It is likely that, in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles will be higher, and certain insurance coverage either will be unavailable or considerably more expensive than it has been in the recent past. In addition, our insurance is subject to coverage limits, and some policies exclude coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination.\nWe may not be successful in implementing and maintaining technology development and enhancements. New technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. Our competitors may develop or acquire the right to use new technologies not available to us, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater resources that may allow them to implement new technologies before we can. Our inability to develop and implement new technologies or products on a timely basis and at competitive cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant liabilities for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or compliance.\nOur operations are subject to federal, regional, state, local and tribal laws and regulations relating to protection of natural resources and the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations and waste management, including the transportation and disposal of waste and other materials. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations on our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the incurrence of capital or other substantial expenditures to mitigate or prevent releases of materials from our facilities, the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations and the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection and public health and safety. Regulations concerning equipment certification also create an ongoing need for regular maintenance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in investigations, restrictions or orders suspending well or other service operations, the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the revocation of permits and the issuance of corrective action orders, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is inherent risk of environmental costs and liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and oilfield and industrial wastes, air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Our water logistics segment includes disposal operations into injection wells that pose risks of seismic activity and environmental liability, including leakage from the wells to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was without fault or lawful at the time it occurred or as a result of the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Clean-up costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and costs associated with past operations or changes in environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate as a motor carrier and therefore are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various state agencies and other regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety and hazardous materials manifesting, labeling, placarding and marking. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. In addition, the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, requirements for recording devices or electronic logging devices or limits on vehicle weight and size.\nLaws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent over time and could continue to do so, which could lead to material increases in costs for future environmental compliance and remediation. The modification or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could curtail exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and natural gas and production of oil and natural gas and could limit well servicing opportunities. We may not be able to recover some or any of our costs of compliance with these laws and regulations from insurance.\nPlease read Items 1 and 2. \u201cBusiness and Properties - Environmental Regulation and Climate Change\u201d for more information on the environmental laws and government regulations that are applicable to us.\nWe may not be able to grow successfully through future acquisitions or successfully manage future growth, and we may not be able to effectively integrate the businesses we do acquire.\nOur business strategy includes growth through the acquisitions of other businesses. We may not be able to continue to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or successfully acquire identified targets. In addition, we may not be successful in integrating our current or future acquisitions into our existing operations, which may result in unforeseen operational difficulties\nor diminished financial performance or require a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s attention. Even if we are successful in integrating our current or future acquisitions into our existing operations, we may not derive the benefits, such as operational or administrative synergies, that we expected from such acquisitions, which may result in the commitment of our capital resources without the expected returns on such capital. Furthermore, competition for acquisition opportunities may escalate, increasing our cost of making further acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making additional acquisitions. We may also be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness in connection with or to fund future acquisitions under our credit agreements.\nWhether we realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful.\nWe depend on several significant customers, and a loss of one or more significant customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur customers consist primarily of major and independent oil and gas companies. During each of 2018 and 2017, our top five customers accounted for 24% and 25% of our revenues, respectively. However, no individual customer composed greater than 10% of our revenues in either year. The loss of any one of our largest customers or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nIn most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers\u2019 cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. In addition, customers who are more highly leveraged or otherwise unable to pay their creditors in the ordinary course of business may become insolvent or be unable to operate as a going concern. We may be unable to collect amounts due or damages we are awarded from these customers, and our efforts to collect such amounts may damage our customer relationships. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nOur industry has experienced a high rate of employee turnover. Any difficulty we experience replacing or adding personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to find enough skilled labor to meet our needs, which could limit our growth. Our business activity historically decreases or increases with the prices of oil and natural gas. In addition, we compete with other oilfield services businesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the requisite technical skills and experience. We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions, which can increase our labor costs or subject us to liabilities to our employees. We may have problems finding enough skilled and unskilled laborers in the future if the demand for our services increases. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages. If we are not able to increase our service rates sufficiently to compensate for wage rate increases, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOther factors may also inhibit our ability to find enough workers to meet our employment needs. Our services require skilled workers who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of our industry volatility and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours. We believe that our success is dependent upon our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled technical personnel. Our inability to employ or retain skilled technical personnel generally could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur success depends on key members of our management, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of some of our executive officers. these individuals possess extensive expertise, talent and leadership. The loss of the services of T. M. \u201cRoe\u201d Patterson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, or\nother key personnel could disrupt our operations. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Patterson and our other executive officers that contain, among other provisions, non-compete agreements, we may not be able to enforce the non-compete provisions in the employment agreements.\nOur business could be negatively affected by cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to conduct and protect our business. These information systems are increasingly subject to sophisticated cybersecurity threats such as unauthorized access to data and systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), computer viruses, or other malicious code, phishing and cyber attacks, and other similar events. These threats arise from numerous sources, not all of which are within our control, including fraud or malice on the part of third parties, accidental technological failure, electrical or telecommunication outages, failures of computer servers or other damage to our property or assets, or outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, we remain vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats.\nGiven the rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats, there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed and implemented to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient in preventing all such incidents or attacks, or avoiding a material impact to our systems when such incidents or attacks do occur. A cyber incident or attack could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary customer information, theft or loss of intellectual property, damage to our reputation with our customers and the market, temporary disruptions of service, failure to meet customer requirements or customer dissatisfaction, theft or exposure to litigation, damage to equipment (which could cause environmental or safety issues) and other financial costs and losses. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to devote additional resources to continue to enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. We do not presently maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks. If we procure such coverage in the future, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. A cyber-related attack could adversely impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action.\nAdverse weather conditions may affect our operations.\nOur operations may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. Severe weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, droughts, flooding, extreme temperatures and hurricanes may cause evacuation of personnel, curtailment of services and suspension of operations, and loss of or damage to equipment and facilities. Damage from any adverse weather conditions could delay our operations and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWeather conditions may also affect the price of crude oil and natural gas, and related demand for our services. Please read the risk factor above, \u201cIf oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, or if oil or natural gas prices remain low or decline further, the demand for our services could be adversely affected.\u201d\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting or regulating emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our field services.\nIn response to studies finding that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases from industrial and energy sources contribute to increases of carbon dioxide levels in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans and contribute to global warming and other environmental effects, the EPA has adopted various regulations under the federal Clean Air Act addressing emissions of greenhouse gases that may affect the oil and gas industry. In 2012 the EPA published a final rule that includes standards to reduce volatile organic compound (\u201cVOC\u201d) emissions associated with oil and natural gas production.. In June 2016, the EPA also published a final rule to reduce methane and additional VOC emissions from oil and natural gas facilities that were constructed, reconstructed or modified after September 18, 2015. The rules and the EPA's subsequent actions to reconsider and propose stays of the rules have been heavily litigated, and in October 2018, the EPA released proposed revisions to some of the 2016 requirements, including reducing the required frequency of fugitive emissions monitoring at well sites and compressor stations. These proposed revisions have not yet been finalized and, as a result the EPA\u2019s 2016 standards are currently in effect. According, future implementation and the ultimate scope of the 2016 standards is uncertain at this time. Federal changes will affect state air permitting programs in states that administer the federal Clean Air Act under a delegation of authority, including states in which we have operations.\nNumerous legislative measures have been introduced in the past that would have imposed restrictions or costs on greenhouse gas emissions (\u201cGHGs\u201d), including from the oil and gas industry. Additionally, in 2010, EPA promulgated final rules for mandatory annual reporting of GHGs from certain onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage, and distribution facilities, as well as from facilities in other industries. In addition, the United States has been involved in international negotiations regarding greenhouse gas reductions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange which led to the signing of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, which became effective in November 2016. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Notably, the earliest date of withdrawal under the terms of the Agreement is November 4, 2020. Additionally, certain U.S. states or regional coalitions of states have adopted measures regulating or limiting greenhouse gases from certain sources or have adopted policies seeking to reduce overall emissions of greenhouse gases. The adoption and implementation of any international treaty or of any federal or state legislation or regulations imposing new or additional reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to comply with such requirements and possibly require the reduction or limitation of emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations and other sources within the industrial or energy sectors. Such legislation or regulations could adversely affect demand for the production of oil and natural gas and thus reduce demand for the services we provide to oil and natural gas producers as well as increase our operating costs by requiring additional costs to operate and maintain equipment and facilities, install emissions controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes and fees relating to emissions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRecently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult for our customers to secure funding for exploration and production activities, which could reduce demand for our services. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases may produce changes in climate or weather, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, which if any such effects were to occur, could have adverse physical effects on our operations, physical assets and field services to exploration and production operators.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our well servicing activities and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe provide hydraulic fracturing and fluid handling services to our customers. Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injection of water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) provisions of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) to expressly exclude certain hydraulic fracturing practices from the definition of \u201cunderground injection.\u201d The EPA has asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel and published proposed guidance relating to such practices. At the state level, several states in which we operate have adopted regulations requiring the disclosure of certain information regarding hydraulic fracturing fluids.\nScrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, as the EPA released its report on environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing in December 2016, concluding that hydraulic fracturing could impact drinking water resources. The federal Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d), an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior published a final rule in March 2015 relating to the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques on public lands and disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents. However, in June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule, the BLM appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in July 2016, the appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLM\u2019s issuance of a proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2015 rule and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. However, in January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM\u2019s rescission of the 2015 rule was brought in federal court. These BLM hydraulic fracturing rules are in various stages of suspension, implementation, delay, rescission, and court challenges; accordingly, the future and ultimate scope of these rules is uncertain. The EPA also issued a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities into publicly owned wastewater treatment plants in June 2016.\nIn addition, some states and localities have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations or ordinances that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, that would require, with some exceptions, disclosure of constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids, or that would impose higher taxes, fees or royalties on natural gas production. Recent research has linked disposal of produced water into disposal wells to an increase in earthquakes across the South and Midwest. Certain state agencies, including those in Texas and Oklahoma, have implemented regulations authorizing the imposition of certain limitations on existing wells if seismic activity increases in the area of an injection well, including a temporary injection ban. For example, in Oklahoma, the OCC has implemented a variety of measures, including the adoption of the National Academy of Science\u2019s \u201ctraffic light system\u201d, pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications and may restrict\noperations at existing wells. Beginning in 2013, the OCC has ordered the reduction of disposal volumes into the Arbuckle formation. More recently, the OCC directed the shut in of a number of disposal wells due to increased earthquake activity in the Arbuckle formation and imposed further disposal well volume reductions in the Edmond area. Moreover, vigorous public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production continues, and has resulted in delays of well permits in some areas.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation at the federal, state or local level could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, incurred by our customers or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations or ordinances restricting or increasing the costs of hydraulic fracturing could potentially increase our costs of operations and cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our well servicing activities, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nPotential listing of species as \"threatened\" or \u201cendangered\u201d under the federal Endangered Species Act could result in increased costs and new operating restrictions or delays on our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers, which could adversely reduce the amount of contract drilling services that we provide to such customers.\nThe federal Endangered Species Act and analogous state laws regulate a variety of activities, including oil and gas development, which could have an adverse effect on species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or their habitats. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause oil and natural gas exploration and production operators to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in affected areas, which impacts could adversely reduce the amount of drilling activities in affected areas, including support services that we provide to such operators under our contract drilling services segment. Numerous species have been listed or proposed for protected status in areas in which we provide or could in the future provide field services. Certain wildflower species, among others, are also species that have been or are being considered for protected status under the ESA and whose range can coincide with oil and natural gas production activities. The presence of protected species in areas where operators whom we provide contract drilling services conduct exploration and production operations could impair such operators\u2019 ability to timely complete well drilling and development and, consequently, adversely affect the amount of contract drilling or other field services that we provided to such operators, which reduction of services could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nLimitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain, dispose of or treat water may impact the services that we can provide to our customers.\nOur water logistics operations involve the supply of significant amounts of water for drilling and hydraulic fracturing, treatment of produced and flowback water, and disposal of a variety of fluids. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain water from local sources, such as restrictions that could be imposed during extreme drought conditions, may require us to find remote sources of water and transport that water to our service locations. In addition, treatment and disposal of such water after use is becoming more highly regulated and restricted. Thus, costs for obtaining, treating, and disposing of water could increase significantly, potentially limiting the services that we can provide to our customers. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur ability to use net operating losses and credit carry-forwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited as a result of issuances of equity or other transactions.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and certain tax credits, to offset future taxable income and tax. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders changes by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nIn connection with our emergence from our Chapter 11 Cases, we experienced an ownership change for the purposes of Section 382 of the Code. The ownership changes have not resulted in the expiration or limitation of any NOLs generated prior to the emergence date. However, any subsequent ownership changes under the provisions of Section 382 could adversely affect the use of NOLs in future periods. The amount of consolidated Federal NOLs available as of December 31, 2018 is approximately $783.3 million.\nRecently enacted U.S. tax legislation, as well as future U.S. tax legislation, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017, which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws. The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code which impact 2017 and 2018 and includes, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%, partially limits the deductibility of business interest expense and net operating losses, limits the deductibility for certain types of executive compensation, and allows the immediate deduction of certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time. Although we have estimated the impact of the Tax Act by incorporating assumptions based upon our current interpretation and analysis to date, the Tax Act is complex, far-reaching and is in a state of being clarified by regulation. Consequently, our analysis of the actual impact of its enactment on us is ongoing and subject to change as provisions of the Tax Act are clarified by regulation. Further analysis of the Tax Act could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock or Warrants\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n\u2022a classified board of directors, so that only approximately one third of our directors are elected each year;\n\u2022limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u2022advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.\nDelaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nOur outstanding warrants are exercisable for shares of our common stock. The exercise of such equity instruments could have a dilutive effect to stockholders of the Company.\nWe currently have outstanding warrants that are exercisable into 2,066,576 shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $55.25 per warrant. The exercise of these warrants into our common stock could have a dilutive effect to the holdings of our existing stockholders. The warrants will not expire until December 23, 2023 and may create an overhang on the market for, and have a negative effect on the market price of, our common stock.\nThere is no guarantee that our outstanding warrants will become in the money, and unexercised warrants may expire worthless. Further, the terms of such warrants may be amended.\nAs long as our stock price is below $55.25 per share, the warrants will have limited economic value, and they may expire worthless. In addition, the warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least a certain percentage of the then-outstanding warrants originally issued to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least a certain percentage of the then outstanding warrants approve of such amendment.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, or the issuance of stock as consideration for a future acquisition, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue 80,000,000 shares of common stock, of which an estimated 26,906,690 shares of common stock were outstanding as of March 1, 2019. This number includes shares issued in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, almost all of which are freely transferable without restriction or further registration pursuant to Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code. We also have 2,428,255 shares of common stock authorized for issuance as equity awards under the Basic Energy Services, Inc. Management Incentive Plan and Non-Employee Director Incentive Plan, respectively. As of March 1, 2019, 595,736 shares are issuable pursuant to outstanding options and 628,381 shares are issuable pursuant to outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards.\nA large percentage of our shares of common stock are held by a relatively small number of investors. We entered into a registration rights agreement, (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d) with certain of those investors pursuant to which we filed a registration statement with the SEC to facilitate potential future sales of such shares by them. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or even the perception that these sales might occur, could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock will have on the price at which our common stock trades or the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, or the issuance of stock as consideration for a future acquisition may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91040, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "BASX"}
