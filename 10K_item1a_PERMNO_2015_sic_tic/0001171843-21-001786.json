RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we may face. Additional risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition or results of operations. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nOur limited operating history with respect to our precision medicine services makes evaluation of our business difficult.\nOur precision medicine services were launched with the initial investment in Helomics during the first quarter of 2018 and have not generated significant revenue to date. Our ability to implement a successful business plan with respect to precision medicine remains unproven and no assurance can be given that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business. We have a limited operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our performance. Our prospects should be considered in light of these risks, and the expenses, technical obstacles, difficulties, market penetration rate, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development of new businesses. These factors include uncertainty as to whether we will be able to:\n\u2022 Succeed in uncertain markets;\n\u2022 Respond effectively to competitive pressures;\n\u2022 Successfully address intellectual property issues of others;\n\u2022 Protect and expand our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022 Continue to develop and upgrade our products.\nIn connection with developing our CRO business, we have committed and will continue to commit significant capital to investments in early-stage companies, all of which may be lost, and which may require us to raise significant additional capital, and our entering into new lines of business will result in significant diversion of management resources, all of which may result in failure of our business.\nWe have committed significant capital and management resources to developing our CRO business and other new business areas, and we intend to continue to devote significant capital and management resources to new businesses. Therefore, we could invest significant capital in business enterprises with no certainty when or whether we will realize a return on these investments. Investments using cash will deplete our capital resources, meaning we will be required to raise significant amounts of new capital. There is no assurance that we will be successful in raising sufficient capital, and the terms of any such financing will be dilutive to our stockholders. We may also acquire technologies or companies by issuing stock or other equity securities rather than, or in addition to, payment of cash, which may have the result of diluting our stockholders\u2019 investments. Further, the energy and resources of our officers and personnel may be substantially diverted to new lines of business, which are unproven. If these businesses are unsuccessful or require too great of a financial investment to be profitable, our business may fail.\nWe rely on sole suppliers for some of the materials used in our molecular diagnostic tests, and we may not be able to find replacements or transition to alternative suppliers in a timely manner.\nWe rely on sole suppliers for certain materials used to perform our molecular diagnostic tests. We also purchase reagents used in our molecular diagnostic tests from sole-source suppliers. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective, or the alternative sources will be available in a timely manner. If these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials needed to perform our molecular diagnostic tests, if the materials do not meet required quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, an interruption in molecular diagnostic test processing could occur. Any such interruption may directly impact our revenue and cause us to incur higher costs.\nIf we are sued for product liability or errors and omissions liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale, and use of our molecular diagnostic tests could lead to product liability claims if someone were to allege that the molecular diagnostic test failed to perform as it was designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the results we provide to physicians or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. A product liability or errors and omissions liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming for us to defend. Although we maintain product liability and errors and omissions insurance, we cannot be certain that our insurance would fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against these types of claims or any judgments, fines, or settlement costs arising out of such claims. Any product liability or errors and omissions liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation or cause us to suspend sales of our products and solutions. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our R&D and commercialization efforts for our TruTumor and PeDAL platforms take longer than expected, the commercial revenues from the service offerings that use these platforms could also be delayed.\nOur CRO business offers various services to pharma, diagnostics, and biotech companies. These services use our TruTumor tumor platform and our PeDAL platform. These platforms are the subject of active R&D to further improve and validate them for commercial use in order to help our clients in their drug discovery, biomarker, and clinical trial activities. We could face delays in this R&D, for example:\n\u00b7 we may not be able to secure access to and approval to use clinical data from academic hospital partners required to validate the platform in a timely manner;\n\u00b7 clinical testing volume (number of specimens coming to us for testing) may not grow sufficiently to drive additional data generation as well as further development of the TruTumor platform;\n\u00b7 patient consent to use the patient\u2019s data and tumor material for R&D may not be sufficient to support R&D; and\n\u00b7 we may not be able to attract and retain the appropriately qualified staff to perform the necessary R&D.\nWe have a limited operating history with the CRO business particularly services using our PeDAL, platform as these are new to the market, which makes it difficult to forecast our future revenues. While we are committed to the buildout of the CRO services for the long term, we cannot predict at this time, with any certainty, the future viability of either business unit.\nWe face significant competition in the surgical fluid waste management industry, including competition from companies with considerably greater resources than ours, and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our market share may decline, and our business could be harmed.\nThe surgical fluid waste management industry is highly competitive with numerous competitors ranging from well-established manufacturers to innovative start-ups. Several of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution resources than we do. Their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products and technologies.\nCompanies with significantly greater resources than ours may be able to reverse engineer our products and/or circumvent our intellectual property position. Such action, if successful, would greatly reduce our competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nWe believe our ability to compete successfully with our STREAMWAY System depends on a number of factors, including, without limitation, our technical innovations of unlimited suction and unlimited capacity capabilities, our innovative and advanced research and development capabilities, strength of our intellectual property rights, sales and distribution channels, and advanced manufacturing capabilities. We plan to employ these and other elements as we develop our products and technologies, but there are many other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share, and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our development and marketing of new products, which could adversely impact the trading price of the shares of our common stock.\nIf demand for our STREAMWAY System or molecular diagnostic tests is unexpectedly high or if we experience problems in scaling our operations, there is no assurance that there will not be supply interruptions or delays that could limit the growth of our revenue.\nWe are currently manufacturing the STREAMWAY System, following GMP compliance regulations of the FDA, at our own facility and anticipate having the capability of producing the STREAMWAY System in sufficient quantities for future near-term sales. We have contracted with a manufacturing company that can manufacture products at higher volumes. However, if demand for our product is higher than anticipated, there is no assurance that we or our manufacturing partners will be able to produce the product in sufficiently higher quantity to satisfy demands.\nLikewise, as demand for our molecular diagnostic tests grow, we will need to continue to scale our testing capacity and processing technology to expand our customer service, billing, and systems processes and to enhance our internal quality assurance program. We will also need additional certified laboratory scientists and other scientific and technical personnel to process higher volumes of our molecular diagnostic tests. We cannot guarantee that increases in scale, related improvements, and quality assurance will be implemented successfully or that appropriate personnel will be available. Failure to implement necessary procedures, transition to new processes, or hire the necessary personnel could result in higher costs of processing tests or an inability to meet demand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to perform our testing on a timely basis at a level consistent with demand, or that our efforts to scale our operations will not negatively affect the quality of test results.\nIf we encounter difficulties in scaling our operations as a result of, among other things, quality control and quality assurance issues and availability of reagents and raw material supplies, we would likely experience reduced sales, increased repair or re-engineering costs, defects, and increased expenses due to switching to alternate suppliers. Any of these results would reduce our revenues and gross margins. Although we attempt to match our capabilities to estimates of marketplace demand, to the extent demand materially varies from our estimates, we may experience constraints in our operations and delivery capacity, which could adversely impact revenue in a given fiscal period. Any supply interruptions or inadequate supply would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we encounter difficulty meeting market demand or quality standards our reputation could be harmed, and our future prospects and business could suffer, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may require additional financing to finance operating expenses and fulfill our business plan. Such financing, if available, will be dilutive.\nWe have not achieved profitability and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses at least through the remainder of 2021. While we have received approximately $34.4 million in new investment during the first quarter of 2021 and are attempting to curtail our expenses, we may need to raise additional capital to finance operating expenses, invest in our sales organization and new product development, compete in the international marketplace, and develop the strategic assets of our Helomics businesses, especially over the longer term. We would attempt to raise these funds through equity or debt financing that may include public offerings, private placements, alternative offerings, further draws on our equity line with Oasis Capital, LLC, or other means. Such additional financing would be dilutive to existing stockholders, and there is no assurance that such financing would be available upon acceptable terms. If such financing or adequate funds from operations are not available, we would be forced to limit our business activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. These possibilities, to the extent available, may be on terms that result in significant dilution to our existing shareholders or that result in our existing shareholders losing part or all of their investment.\nOur business and operations have been and will likely continue to be materially and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the recent spread of COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. In response to the crisis, emergency measures have been imposed by governments worldwide, including mandatory social distancing and the shutdown of non-essential businesses. These measures have adversely impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, and our business and operations have been and will likely continue to be materially and adversely affected. For example, our contract manufacturer for the STREAMWAY\u00ae System has been forced to change locations, thereby delaying our order fulfillment for parts. We have also reduced on-site staff at several of our facilities, resulting in delayed production, less efficiency, and our sales staff is unable to visit with hospital administrators who are our customers and potential customers. In addition, COVID-19 has impacted the Company\u2019s capital and financial resources, including our overall liquidity position and outlook. For instance, our accounts receivable has slowed while our suppliers continue to ask for pre-delivery deposits. Ultimately, the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operational and financial performance will depend on, among other matters, the duration and intensity of the pandemic; the level of success of global vaccination efforts; governmental and private sector responses to the pandemic and the impact of such responses on us; and the impact of the pandemic on our employees, customers, suppliers, operations and sales, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. These factors may remain prevalent for a significant period of time even after the pandemic subsides, including due to a continued or prolonged recession in the U.S. or other major economies. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as with any adverse public health developments, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition and heighten or exacerbate risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are dependent on a few key executive officers for our success. Our inability to retain those officers would impede our business plan and growth strategies, which would have a negative impact on our business and the value of an investment.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience, and performance of key members of our management team. We heavily depend on our management team: Carl Schwartz, our Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), and Bob Myers, our Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d). We have entered into employment agreements with the CEO and the CFO and may expand the relatively small number of executives. Were we to lose one or more of these key individuals, we would be forced to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of a replacement, which could result in both a delay in the implementation of our business plan and the diversion of our limited working capital. We can give no assurance that we would be able to find satisfactory replacements for these key individuals at all, or on terms that are not unduly expensive or burdensome to us.\nIf we are required to further write down goodwill and other intangible assets, our financial condition and operating results would be negatively affected.\nWhen we acquire a business, a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. For example, when we acquired Helomics, we acquired $3,725,000 in intangible assets and $23,790,290 in goodwill, which represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. We test intangible assets and goodwill for impairment at least annually. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an impairment of goodwill of $8,100,000 and during the year ended December 31, 2020 we recorded an impairment of goodwill of $12,876,498. During 2019, we also recorded an impairment of our intangible asset associated with our license agreements of $770,250. Under current accounting standards, if we determine that intangible assets or goodwill are impaired in the future, we will be required to further write down these assets. Any write-downs that may be required to be recorded would adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur business is dependent upon proprietary intellectual property rights, which if we were unable to protect, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trade secret and other intellectual property rights, contractual restrictions, and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We currently own and may in the future own or license additional patent rights or trade secrets in the U.S., with non-provisional patents elsewhere in the world that cover certain of our products. We rely on patent laws and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect our products and intangible assets.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us and we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property. While we apply for patents covering our products and technologies and uses thereof, we may fail to apply for patents on important products and technologies in a timely fashion, or at all, or we may fail to apply for patents in relevant jurisdictions. Others could seek to design around our current or future patented technologies. These intellectual property rights are important to our ongoing operations and no assurance can be given that any measure we implement will be sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights.\nFurther, competitors could willfully infringe upon our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology, or develop their own competitive technologies that arguably fall outside of our intellectual property rights. Others may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or replicate any of our products and technologies. Also, with respect to our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, we cannot be certain that the confidentiality agreements we have entered into with employees will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, we may lose the protection afforded by these rights through patent expirations, legal challenges, or governmental action. If our intellectual property does not adequately protect us against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business and the results of our operations. To the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors\u2019 products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our overall business.\nIf we become subject to intellectual property actions, it could hinder our ability to deliver our products and services and our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe could be subject to legal or regulatory actions alleging intellectual property infringement or similar claims against us. Companies may apply for or be awarded patents or have other intellectual property rights covering aspects of our technologies or businesses. Litigation may be necessary for us to enforce our patents and proprietary rights or to determine the scope, coverage, and validity of the proprietary rights of others. The outcome of any litigation or other proceeding is inherently uncertain and might not be favorable to us, and we might not be able to obtain licenses to technology that we require on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, if it is determined that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be prevented from marketing our products. While we are currently not subject to any material intellectual property litigation, any future litigation alleging intellectual property infringement could be costly, particularly in light of our limited resources. Similarly, if we determine that third parties are infringing on our patents or other intellectual property rights, our limited resources may prevent us from litigating or otherwise taking actions to enforce our rights. Any such litigation or inability to enforce our rights could require us to change our business practices, hinder or prevent our ability to deliver our products and services, and result in a negative impact to our business. Expansion of our business via product line enhancements or new product lines to drive increased growth in current or new markets may be inhibited by the intellectual property rights of our competitors and/or suppliers. Our inability to successfully mitigate those factors may significantly reduce our market opportunity and subsequent growth. Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisk Factors Relating to Regulation\nOur business is subject to intense governmental regulation and scrutiny, both in the U.S. and abroad.\nThe production, marketing, and R&D of our products is subject to extensive regulation and review by the FDA and other governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. In addition to testing and approval procedures, extensive regulations also govern marketing, manufacturing, distribution, labeling, and record keeping. If we do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, violations could result in warning letters, non-approvals, suspensions of regulatory approvals, civil penalties and criminal fines, product seizures and recalls, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.\nPeriodically, legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced that could alter the review and approval process relating to medical products. It is possible that the FDA will issue additional regulations further restricting the sale of our present or proposed products. Any change in legislation or regulations that governs the review and approval process relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costlier to obtain approval for new products, or to produce, market, and distribute existing products.\nIf the FDA begins to enforce regulation of our molecular diagnostic tests, we could incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain pre-market clearance or approval and costs associated with complying with post-market requirements.\nClinical laboratory tests like our molecular diagnostic tests are regulated under CLIA as well as by applicable state laws. Most Laboratory Developed Tests (\u201cLDTs\u201d) are currently not subject to the FDA\u2019s regulation (although reagents, instruments, software, or components provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs may be subject to regulation). In October 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents: \u201cFramework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests\u201d, which provides an overview of how the FDA would regulate LDTs through a risk-based approach, and \u201cFDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests\u201d, which provides guidance on how the FDA intends to collect information on existing LDTs, including adverse event reports. On January 13, 2017, the FDA also issued a discussion paper on LDTs. Pursuant to the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, LDT manufacturers would be subject to medical device registration, listing, and adverse event reporting requirements. The risk-based classification considers the LDT\u2019s intended use, technological characteristics, and the risk to patients if the LDT were to fail. The FDA has indicated in its guidance that screening devices for malignant cancers are LDTs of higher concern to the FDA and for which enforcement of pre-market and post-market review requirements would likely commence before other LDT types.\nPursuant to the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, LDT manufacturers would be required to either submit a pre-market application and receive the FDA\u2019s approval before an LDT may be marketed or submit a pre-market notification in advance of marketing. These requirements would be phased in, starting with higher risk LDTs, following the issuance of the FDA\u2019s final guidance on this topic, which the FDA has identified as a priority. The draft guidance provides that LDTs that are already marketed at the time the final guidance is issued would not be withdrawn from the market during the FDA\u2019s review process.\nThere is no timeframe within which the FDA must issue its final guidance, but issuance of this final guidance has been identified among a list of the FDA\u2019s priorities. As of the date of this filing, the FDA has not issued its final guidance. In August 2020, however, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - the parent agency for FDA - announced that the FDA \u201cwill not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, as opposed to through guidance documents, compliance manuals, website statements, or other informal issuances.\u201d It is unclear at this time whether the Biden Administration will rescind or reverse this policy. It is also unclear at this time when, or if, the FDA will finalize its plans to end enforcement discretion (e.g., via notice and comment rulemaking or otherwise), and even then, the new regulatory requirements are expected to be phased-in over time. Nevertheless, the FDA may attempt to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time.\nLegislative proposals addressing the FDA\u2019s oversight of LDTs have been introduced in previous Congresses, and we expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time-to-time. The likelihood that Congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the FDA\u2019s plans to regulate certain LDTs as medical devices is difficult to predict at this time. If the FDA ultimately regulates certain LDTs, whether via final guidance, final regulation, or as instructed by Congress, our molecular diagnostic tests may be subject to certain additional regulatory requirements. The cost of conducting clinical trials and otherwise developing data and information to support pre-market applications may be significant. If we are required to submit applications for our currently marketed tests, we may be required to conduct additional studies, which may be time-consuming and costly and could result in our currently marketed tests being withdrawn from the market. If our tests are allowed to remain on the market, but there is uncertainty in the marketplace about our tests, and if we are required by the FDA to label them investigational, or if labeling claims the FDA allows us to make are limited, orders may decline, and reimbursement may be adversely affected. Continued compliance with the FDA\u2019s regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to heightened regulation by the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements.\nLikewise, if we voluntarily pursue the FDA\u2019s pre-market review of our tests, there can be no assurance that our molecular diagnostic tests or any tests we may develop or acquire in the future will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, nor can there be assurance that labeling claims will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our tests.\nIn sum, we cannot predict the timing or form of any such guidance or regulation, or the potential effect on our existing molecular diagnostic tests or our tests in development, or the potential impact of such guidance or regulation on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with Federal, State, and foreign laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business.\nWe are subject to CLIA, a Federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease. CLIA regulations mandate specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, and quality assurance. CLIA certification is also required in order for our business to be eligible to bill Federal and State healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payors, for our molecular diagnostic tests. To renew these certifications, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make random inspections of our clinical reference laboratories. Pennsylvania laws also require that we maintain a license and establish standards for the day-to-day operation of our clinical reference laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In addition, our Pittsburgh laboratory is required to be licensed on a test-specific basis by certain other states. If we were unable to obtain or lose our CLIA certificate or State licenses for our laboratories, whether as a result of revocation, suspension, or limitation, we would no longer be able to perform our molecular diagnostic tests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we were to lose our licenses issued by the States in which we are required to hold licenses, we would not be able to test specimens from those States. New molecular diagnostic tests we may develop may be subject to new approvals by governmental bodies, and we may not be able to offer our new molecular diagnostic tests to patients in such jurisdictions until such approvals are received.\nComplying with numerous statutes and regulations pertaining to our molecular diagnostics business is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.\nWe are subject to regulation by both the Federal government and the States in which we conduct our molecular diagnostics business, including:\n\u2022 The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as supplemented by various other statutes;\n\u2022 The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, the amendments thereto, and the regulations promulgated thereunder and contained in 21 C.F.R. Parts 203 and 205;\n\u2022 CLIA and State licensing requirements;\n\u2022 Manufacturing and promotion laws;\n\u2022 Medicare and Medicaid billing and payment regulations applicable to clinical laboratories;\n\u2022 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a Federal healthcare program;\n\u2022 The Federal Stark physician self-referral law (and state equivalents), which prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated health services covered by the Medicare program, including laboratory and pathology services, if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services, unless the financial relationship falls within an applicable exception to the prohibition;\n\u2022 The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which established comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy and security of protected health information and requirements for the use of certain standardized electronic transactions, and amendments made in 2013 to HIPAA under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which strengthen and expand HIPAA privacy and security compliance requirements, increase penalties for violators, extend enforcement authority to state attorneys general, and impose requirements for breach notification;\n\u2022 The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies;\n\u2022 The Federal False Claims Act, which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government;\n\u2022 Other Federal and State fraud and abuse laws, prohibitions on self-referral, fee-splitting restrictions, prohibitions on the provision of products at no or discounted cost to induce physician or patient adoption, and false claims acts, which may extend to services reimbursable by any third-party payor, including private insurers;\n\u2022 The prohibition on reassignment of Medicare claims, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the reassignment of Medicare claims to any other party;\n\u2022 The rules regarding billing for diagnostic tests reimbursable by the Medicare program, which prohibit a physician or other supplier from marking up the price of the technical component or professional component of a diagnostic test ordered by the physician or other supplier and supervised or performed by a physician who does not \u201cshare a practice\u201d with the billing physician or supplier; and\n\u2022 State laws that prohibit other specified practices related to billing such as billing physicians for testing that they order, waiving coinsurance, co-payments, deductibles, and other amounts owed by patients, and billing a State Medicaid program at a price that is higher than what is charged to other payors.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations. We periodically conduct internal reviews of our compliance with these laws. Our compliance is also subject to governmental review. The growth of our business may increase the potential of violating these laws, regulations, or our internal policies and procedures. The risk that we are found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Violations of Federal or State regulations may incur investigation or enforcement action by the FDA, Department of Justice, State agencies, or other legal authorities, and may result in substantial civil, criminal, or other sanctions. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert managements\u2019 attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, and fines, we could be required to refund payments received by it, we could face possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal or State healthcare programs, and we could even be required to cease operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes contamination or injury, we could be liable for resulting damages.\nWe are subject to Federal, State, and local laws, rules and regulations governing the use, discharge, storage, handling, and disposal of biological material, chemicals, and waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling, or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, remediation costs, and any related penalties or fines. This liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant, and our failure to comply may result in substantial fines or other consequences, and either could have a significant impact on our operating results.\nThe healthcare regulatory and political framework is uncertain and evolving.\nHealthcare laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and may change significantly in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, (\u201cACA\u201d), was adopted, which is a healthcare reform measure that provided healthcare insurance for approximately 30 million additional Americans. The ACA includes a variety of healthcare reform provisions and requirements that became effective at varying times through 2018 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, which may significantly impact our industry and our business. For instance, the ACA requires \u201cApplicable Manufacturers\u201d to disclose to the Secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services drug sample distributions and certain payments or transfers of value to covered recipients (physicians and teaching hospitals) on an annual basis. \u201cApplicable Manufacturers\u201d and \u201cApplicable Group Purchasing Organizations\u201d must also disclose certain physician ownership or investment interests. The data submitted will ultimately be made available on a public website. Based upon the structure of our relationship with our clients, we may be included in the definition of \u201cApplicable Manufacturer\u201d for purposes of the disclosure requirements or may provide services that include the transfer of drug samples and/or other items of value to covered recipients. As such, we may be required to disclose or provide information that is subject to disclosure. There may be certain risks and penalties associated with the failure to properly make such disclosures, including but not limited to the specific civil liabilities set forth in the ACA, which allows for a maximum civil monetary penalty per \u201cApplicable Manufacturer\u201d of $1,150,000 per year. There may be additional risks and claims made by third parties derived from an improper disclosure that are difficult to ascertain at this time.\nWe cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, or how any future legislation or regulation may affect us. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the constitutionality of the ACA, although it is unclear when a decision will be made. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation\u2019s stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against the corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law or the corporation\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or (4) any action asserting a claim against the corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It could apply, however, to a suit that falls within one or more of the categories enumerated in the exclusive forum provision and asserts claims under the Securities Act, as amended, inasmuch as Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rule and regulations thereunder. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision with respect to claims under the Securities Act, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of their choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees.\nIf a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation, as amended, to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nLimitations on director and officer liability and indemnification of our officers and directors by us may discourage stockholders from bringing a suit against a director.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide, with certain exceptions as permitted by governing state law, that a director or officer shall not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director, except for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud, knowing violation of law, or unlawful payments of dividends. These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders on our behalf against a director. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by governing state law.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and we may never pay dividends; investors must rely on stock appreciation, if any, for any return on investment in our common stock.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans, and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by state law. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize certain returns on their investment. As a result, investors must rely on stock appreciation and a liquid trading market for any return on investment in our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors\u2019 ability to issue undesignated preferred stock and the existence of anti-takeover provisions may depress the value of our common stock.\nOur authorized capital includes 20 million shares of preferred stock. Of this amount and 2,300,000 shares have been designated as series B convertible preferred stock and the remaining authorized shares are undesignated preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of the shares of undesignated preferred stock, including the authority to establish one or more series and to fix the powers, preferences, rights, and limitations of such class or series, without seeking stockholder approval. Further, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law regarding business combinations. We may, in the future, consider adopting additional anti-takeover measures. The authority of our Board of Directors to issue undesignated stock and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, as well as any future anti-takeover measures adopted by us, may, in certain circumstances, delay, deter, or prevent takeover attempts and other changes in control not approved by our Board of Directors. As a result, our stockholders may lose opportunities to dispose of their shares at favorable prices generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal and the market price, voting, and other rights of the holders of common stock may also be affected.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain technical personnel, sales and marketing personnel, and other skilled management.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel. Failure to attract and retain necessary technical, sales and marketing personnel, and skilled management could adversely affect our business. If we fail to attract, train, and retain sufficient numbers of these highly qualified people, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments is limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and may be subject to further limitation because of prior or future offerings of our stock or other transactions.\nSections 382 and 383 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally an increase in the ownership percentage of certain stockholders in the stock of a company by more than 50% over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by that company. Generally, if an ownership change, as defined by Section 382 of the Code, occurs, the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate and the value of stock immediately before the ownership change.\nCosts incurred because we are a public company may affect our profitability.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses and are subject to the SEC\u2019s rules and regulations relating to public disclosure that generally involve a substantial expenditure of financial resources. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, require changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. Full compliance with such rules and regulations requires significant legal and financial compliance costs and makes some activities more time-consuming and costlier, which may negatively impact our financial results. To the extent our earnings suffer as a result of the financial impact of our SEC reporting or compliance costs, our ability to develop an active trading market for our securities could be harmed.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain stockholders may be eligible to sell some or all of their shares of common stock pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144 as in effect as of the date of this filing, a stockholder (or stockholders whose shares are aggregated) who has satisfied the applicable holding period and is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of sale, or at any time during the three months preceding a sale, may sell their shares of common stock. Any substantial sale, or cumulative sales, of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nWe expect volatility in the price of our common stock, which may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our common stock may be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nAcquisitions involve risks that could result in adverse changes to operating results, cash flows, and liquidity.\nWe may desire to make strategic acquisitions in the future. However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, or we may be unable to obtain the consent of our stockholders and therefore, may not be able to complete such acquisitions. We may pay for acquisitions with our common stock or with convertible securities, which may dilute shareholders\u2019 investment in our common stock, or we may decide to pursue acquisitions that our investors may not agree with. In connection with potential acquisitions, we may agree to substantial earn-out arrangements. To the extent we defer the payment of the purchase price for any acquisition through a cash earn-out arrangement, cash flows will be reduced in subsequent periods. In addition, acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including:\n\u2022 the ability to profitably manage acquired businesses or successfully integrate the operations of acquired businesses, as well as the acquired business\u2019s financial reporting and accounting control systems into our existing platforms;\n\u2022 increased indebtedness and contingent purchase price obligations associated with an acquisition;\n\u2022 the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions, or unforeseen internal difficulties;\n\u2022 the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs;\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from existing operations; and\n\u2022 the ability to retain or hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations.\nCompleting acquisitions may require significant management time and financial resources because we may need to assimilate widely dispersed operations with different corporate cultures. In addition, acquired companies may have liabilities that we failed to or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations. We cannot assure the shareholders\u2019 that the indemnification granted by sellers of acquired companies will be sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with businesses or properties we assume upon consummation of an acquisition. We may learn additional information about our acquired businesses that could have a material adverse effect on us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with, or resulting from, acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Borrowings or issuances of convertible securities associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtedness, which could adversely impact our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions to our business or the business of our third-party service providers could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nOur business requires that we collect and store sensitive data, including protected health and credit card information and proprietary business and financial information. We face a number of risks relative to the protection of, and the service providers\u2019 protection of, this critical information, including loss of access, inappropriate disclosure, and inappropriate access, as well as risks associated with our ability to identify and audit such events. The secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this critical information are vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or otherwise breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other activities. While we have not experienced any such attack or breach, if such event would occur and cause interruptions in our operations, our networks could be compromised and the information we store on those networks could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Unauthorized access, loss, or dissemination could disrupt our operations, including collecting, processing, and preparing company financial information, managing the administrative aspects of our business, and damaging our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, and data protection laws in the United States are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems, and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nIf our information technology and communications systems fail or we experience a significant interruption in our operation, our reputation, business, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on information technology and communications systems. The failure of these systems to operate as anticipated could disrupt our business and result in decreased revenue and increased overhead costs. In addition, we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Our information technology and communications systems, including the information technology systems and services that are maintained by third-party vendors, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, fire, terrorist attacks, malicious attacks by computer viruses or hackers, and power loss or failure of computer systems, Internet, telecommunications or data networks. If these systems or services become unavailable or suffer a security breach, we may expend significant resources to address these problems, and our reputation, business, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 15645, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "POAI"}
