Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may materially adversely affect us in future periods. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.\nRisks Related to our Business, Operations and Strategy\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and continues to pose risks to, our business, results of operations and financial condition, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and remain unpredictable.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19. We continue to experience a decline in elective surgical procedures globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, the highly transmissible Delta and Omicron variants resulted in further deferrals of elective surgical procedures, and we believe that staffing shortages at hospitals also contributed to the deferral of such procedures. We expect these declines to continue for the duration of the pandemic, and they may be further impacted by COVID-19 variants and resurgences.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has had, and we expect it to continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our net sales have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. It is not certain when our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows will return to pre-pandemic levels.\nDeferral of elective surgical procedures has caused us to experience certain of the following, and we may experience other of the following, among other potential negative outcomes:\n\u2022\nlower revenues, profits and cash flows compared to historic trends;\n\u2022\nadditional charges from operating our manufacturing facilities at less than normal capacity;\n\u2022\ngoodwill impairment charges;\n\u2022\ndelays in certain strategic projects and investments, including our restructuring plans, which will delay or may eliminate the effectiveness of these strategic initiatives;\n\u2022\nexcess inventory we cannot sell;\n\u2022\nfailure to satisfy the covenants in our credit facilities, which may cause any outstanding amounts to be payable immediately and could affect our access to capital to fund our business; and\n\u2022\ndowngrades to our credit ratings, which could result in increased interest expense.\nCOVID-19 and the current financial, economic and capital markets environment, and future developments in these and other areas, present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, volume of business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur restructuring program may not be successful or we may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring initiatives.\nIn December 2019, our Board of Directors approved, and we initiated, a global restructuring program (the \u201c2019 Restructuring Plan\u201d) with an objective of reducing costs to allow us to further invest in higher priority growth opportunities, which program is ongoing. In December 2021, our management also initiated a global restructuring program (the \u201c2021 Restructuring Plan\u201d) to reorganize our operations in preparation for the planned spinoff of ZimVie with an objective of reducing costs. Restructuring initiatives involve complex plans and actions that may include, or result in, workforce reductions, global plant closures and/or consolidations, product portfolio rationalizations and asset impairments. Additionally, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiencies during transitional periods. Restructuring initiatives present significant risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring program, as well as management distraction. For more information on our restructuring program, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success largely depends on the strength of our talent, including our senior management, and ensuring we have meaningful succession plans in place. We may not be able to attract, retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business, which could harm our business.\nOur future performance depends, in large part, on the continued skills, experiences, competencies and services of our senior management and other key talent, including our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate key talent. Competition for talent in the various geographies and business segments in which we operate is significant. Our ability to attract and retain key talent, in particular senior management, will be dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation packages. There is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key talent, or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key talent, could harm our business. In particular, we may have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave, and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner.\nEffective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and orderly transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations or achieve expected cost savings or profitability from our acquisitions.\nOur acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties in integrating personnel and sales forces, operations, manufacturing, logistics, research and development, information technology, compliance, vendor management, communications, purchasing, accounting, marketing, administration and other systems and processes;\n\u2022\ndifficulties harmonizing and optimizing quality systems and operations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties related to entering geographic regions where we do not have prior experience;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nunforeseen risks and liabilities associated with businesses acquired, including any unknown vulnerabilities in acquired technology or compromises of acquired data; and\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue or realize sufficient cost savings to offset acquisition or investment costs.\nAs a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. These risks would likely be greater in the case of larger acquisitions.\nThe planned spinoff of our Spine and Dental businesses may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the intended results.\nAs previously announced, we plan to spin off our Spine and Dental businesses to form ZimVie Inc., a new and independent, publicly traded company (\u201cZimVie\u201d) through a tax-free distribution to our stockholders of publicly traded stock in ZimVie. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the planned spinoff. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete the spinoff on the terms or on the timeline that we announced, or at all.\nWe expect the completion of the spinoff to continue to require significant expenses and management time and effort. We will have continuing obligations to ZimVie after the completion of the spinoff, which may cause us to incur additional costs. The spinoff will also require modifications to our systems and processes used to operate our business. We may experience delays, increased costs and other difficulties related to these modifications during or following the spinoff, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Following the spinoff, we will be a smaller, less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could adversely affect our operating results. We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees during the pendency of the spinoff and following its completion, which could harm our business.\nFurther, if the spinoff is completed, the anticipated benefits and synergies of the transaction, strategic and competitive advantages of each company, and future growth and other opportunities for each company may not be realized within the expected time periods or at all. Failure to implement the spinoff effectively could also result in a lower value to our company and our stockholders.\nThe planned spinoff, and any subsequent divestiture of our retained interest in ZimVie, could result in substantial tax liability.\nWe obtained an Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) ruling, and we intend to obtain an opinion as to the tax-free nature of the spinoff under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The IRS ruling is, and the opinion will be, based, among other things, on various factual assumptions and representations we will make. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on the opinion and ruling may be jeopardized. If the spinoff does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to us, to our stockholders and to ZimVie stockholders could be substantial.\nWe have announced we intend to retain 19.7% of the outstanding shares of ZimVie common stock upon the spinoff and to divest these shares after the spinoff in a tax-efficient manner. There can be no assurance that any such divestiture will occur, will occur at a time or times favorable to us, or will occur at prices or on terms favorable to us. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any such divestiture achieves a desired or any favorable tax\ntreatment. If the divesture does not achieve a favorable tax treatment, the resulting tax liability to us, to our stockholders, and to ZimVie stockholders could be substantial.\nInterruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers have manufacturing sites all over the world. In some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants. Damage to one or more facilities from weather or natural disaster-related events, vulnerabilities in technology, cyber-attacks against our information systems or the information systems of our business partners (such as ransomware attacks), or issues in manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the QSR and Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, equipment breakdown or malfunction, reductions in operations and/or worker absences due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics (or local, state, or national reactions to such epidemics), or other factors could adversely affect the ability to manufacture our products. In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand. We have experienced such interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may experience such interruptions in the future. In the event of a significant interruption, for example, as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals. As a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by third-party suppliers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from third-party suppliers and we outsource some key manufacturing activities. Certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. In certain cases, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA and other worldwide regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our suppliers' manufacturing processes and the need for clearance or approval of significant changes by worldwide regulatory bodies prior to implementation. A reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products, such as due to one or more suppliers experiencing reductions in operations and/or worker absences due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics; an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service. To the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity, availability of materials for sterilization, regulatory or other constraints, including federal and state regulations on the use of ethylene oxide, or reductions in operations and/or worker absences due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics, we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizers, sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nMoreover, we are subject to the SEC\u2019s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (tantalum, tin and tungsten (or their ores) and gold), which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. This rule could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. In addition, we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products. We have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through our due diligence procedures. As a result, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders.\nWe are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect our information systems or data, including from data breaches, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure. As a result of technology initiatives, expanding privacy and cybersecurity laws, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. In addition, some of our products and services incorporate software or information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy, and some products or software we provide to customers connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes. We also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and, as a result, we manage a number of third-party suppliers who may or could have access to our confidential information, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information of patients, employees and customers (collectively \u201cConfidential Information\u201d).\nOur information systems, and those of third-party suppliers with whom we contract, require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, changing threats and vulnerabilities, and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information. In addition, given their size and complexity, these systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or Confidential Information.\nLike other large multi-national corporations, we have experienced instances of successful phishing attacks on our email systems and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future. We also are subject to other cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, payment fraud or other cyber incidents. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees who are able to work remotely are doing so, and malicious cyber actors may increase malware campaigns and phishing emails targeting teleworkers, preying on the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks. Our incident response efforts, business continuity procedures and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. If we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could:\n\u2022\nlose existing customers, vendors and business partners;\n\u2022\nhave difficulty attracting new customers;\n\u2022\nhave problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing;\n\u2022\nsuffer outages or disruptions in our operations or supply chain;\n\u2022\nhave difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud;\n\u2022\nhave disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals;\n\u2022\nhave regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed;\n\u2022\nincur increased operating expenses;\n\u2022\nbe subject to issues with product functionality that may result in a loss of data, risk to patient safety, field actions and/or product recalls;\n\u2022\nincur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach; or\n\u2022\nsuffer other adverse consequences.\nWhile we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful. We will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and work with government authorities to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents; however, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated, frequent and adaptive. Therefore, despite our efforts, we cannot assure that cyber-attacks or data breaches will not occur or that systems issues will not arise in the future. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, breach, interruption, corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies,\nincluding biological therapies. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies and improve existing products and technologies. Competition is primarily on the basis of:\n\u2022\ntechnology;\n\u2022\ninnovation;\n\u2022\nquality;\n\u2022\nreputation;\n\u2022\ncustomer service; and\n\u2022\npricing.\nIn markets outside of the U.S., other factors influence competition as well, including:\n\u2022\nlocal distribution systems;\n\u2022\ncomplex regulatory environments; and\n\u2022\ndiffering medical philosophies and product preferences.\nOur competitors may:\n\u2022\nhave greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;\n\u2022\nrespond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;\n\u2022\nundertake more extensive marketing campaigns;\n\u2022\nadopt more aggressive pricing policies; or\n\u2022\nbe more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.\nAny of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.\nIf we fail to retain the employees and independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.\nOur marketing success in the U.S. and abroad depends significantly upon our employees\u2019, agents\u2019 and distributors\u2019 sales and service expertise in the marketplace. Many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents\u2019 detailed knowledge of products and instruments. A loss of a significant number of our agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.\nDemand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we may not anticipate because of:\n\u2022\nevolving customer needs;\n\u2022\nchanging demographics;\n\u2022\nslowing industry growth rates;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the musculoskeletal implant market;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products and technologies;\n\u2022\nevolving surgical philosophies; and\n\u2022\nevolving industry standards.\nWithout the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. If that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate customer needs;\n\u2022\ncommercialize new products in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nmanufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time;\n\u2022\ndifferentiate our offerings from competitors\u2019 offerings;\n\u2022\nachieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;\n\u2022\nsatisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost procedures;\n\u2022\ninnovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and\n\u2022\nprovide adequate medical education relating to new products.\nIn addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors:\n\u2022\nentrenched patterns of clinical practice;\n\u2022\nthe need for regulatory clearance; and\n\u2022\nuncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.\nMoreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nIf third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed.\nWe sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. These third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a product or service used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and products.\nIn addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. If third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels or change reimbursement models for hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products may decline, or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nWe have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets. For example, China has implemented a volume-based procurement process designed to decrease prices for medical devices and other products. If key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, including through political changes or transitions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to cost containment measures in the United States and other countries, resulting in pricing pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows.\nInitiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business. These initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing. For example, China has implemented a volume-based procurement process designed to decrease prices for certain medical devices and other products, which has in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, reduced margins on covered devices and products, required renegotiation of distributor arrangements, and incurrence of inventory-related charges. Pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments becoming the primary payors of healthcare expenses, reductions in reimbursement levels and government laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and pricing generally.\nIn addition, many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs. Group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization\u2019s affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer\u2019s products, we may be precluded from making\nsales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement. Our failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nFinancial, Credit and Liquidity Risks\nWe incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations, and the phase-out, replacement or unavailability of LIBOR and/or other interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect our indebtedness.\nWe incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions. At December 31, 2021, our total indebtedness was $7.1 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2021, our debt service principal obligations (excluding interest, leases and equipment notes), during the next 12 months are expected to be $1.6 billion. As a result of the increase in our debt, demands on our cash resources have increased. The increased level of debt could, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nadversely affect our credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing our indebtedness might increase and our ability to obtain surety bonds could be impaired;\n\u2022\nadversely affect the market price of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to apply proceeds from a future offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.\nIn addition, the interest rates applicable to certain of our debt obligations are based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d or \u201cLIBO rate\u201d). Any increase in interest rates applicable to our debt obligations would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, in July 2017, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates to the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited. On March 5, 2021, the FCA publicly announced publication of all non-U.S. dollar denominated LIBO rate settings, as well as the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar denominated LIBO rate, will permanently cease as of December 31, 2021, and that publication of the overnight and 12-month U.S. dollar denominated LIBO rate settings will permanently cease after June 30, 2023. In addition, the FCA announced that immediately after June 30, 2023, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month U.S. dollar LIBO rates will cease to be provided or, subject to the FCA\u2019s consideration of the case, may be provided on a synthetic basis and no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality that they are intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored. The dates announced by the FCA may change or other administrators of LIBO rates and/or regulators may take further action that could change or otherwise impact the availability and characteristics of LIBO rates, currencies and tenors. The credit agreements governing our debt provide a mechanism for determining alternative rates of interest using customary hardwired rate replacement provisions which establish a waterfall approach for establishment of a replacement benchmark interest rate in the event that LIBO rates are unavailable, subject to spread adjustments to be determined with reference to the recommendations of relevant governmental bodies or, in certain circumstances, evolving or then-prevailing market conventions for determining or calculating such spread adjustment for U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities. Any alternative, successor, or replacement rate may not be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBO rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the LIBO rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability, which may increase our overall interest expense on unhedged variable rate indebtedness which is currently based on the LIBO rate.\nWe will continue to monitor the situation and address the potential reference rate changes in future debt obligations that we may incur. Accordingly, the potential effect of the phase-out, replacement or unavailability of LIBOR, or the unavailability of any other interest rate benchmark such as EURIBOR or TIBOR, on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. Further, the use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement rate as a basis for\ncalculating interest with respect to any outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in our costs of capital or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nChanges in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. For example, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting\u201d project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These changes, as adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe proposed Build Back Better Act or similar legislation, if enacted, could lead to changes in tax laws that could negatively impact our effective tax rate.\nThe Build Back Better Act proposed an increase in the U.S. Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) foreign minimum tax rate from 10.5% to 15%, assessing the GILTI tax on a per country basis, reduction of the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax benefit, and disallowance of certain corporate interest expense. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are ultimately enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our independent agents and distributors are characterized as employees, we would be subject to additional tax and other liabilities.\nWe structure our relationships with independent agents and distributors in a manner that we believe results in an independent contractor relationship, not an employee relationship. Although we believe that our independent agents and distributors are properly characterized as independent contractors, tax or other regulatory authorities may in the future challenge our characterization of these relationships. Further, we have been subject to lawsuits challenging the characterization of these relationships in recent years. Changes in classification from independent contractor to employee can result in a change to various requirements associated with the payment of wages, tax withholding, and the provision of unemployment, health, and other traditional employer-employee related benefits. If regulatory authorities or state, federal or foreign courts were to determine that our independent agents or distributors are employees, and not independent contractors, we would be required to withhold income taxes, to withhold and pay social security, Medicare and similar taxes and to pay unemployment and other related payroll taxes. We would also be liable for unpaid past taxes and subject to penalties. As a result, any determination that our independent agents and distributors are our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFuture material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results.\nGoodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. At December 31, 2021, we had $9.2 billion in goodwill and $6.3 billion of intangible assets. The goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable. As discussed further in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, in the first quarter of 2020, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $612.0 million as a result of the adverse impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and a change in our reportable segments, and in the second quarter of 2021 and 2020, we recorded $16.3 million and $33.0 million, respectively, of in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) intangible asset impairments on certain IPR&D projects. If the operating performance at one or more of our reporting units falls significantly below current levels, including if elective surgical procedures are deferred longer than our current expectations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if\nmarket conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline, or as a result of restructuring initiatives pursuant to which we reorganize our reporting units, we could be required to record additional impairment charges. Any write-off of a material portion of our goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.\nGlobal Operational Risks\nWe conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.\nWe sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2021 from outside the U.S. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations. Our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign regulatory requirements, such as more stringent requirements for regulatory clearance of products;\n\u2022\ndiffering local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ndiminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures, import or export requirements, new or increased tariffs, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers, which may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our operating costs;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n\u2022\ncomplex data privacy and cybersecurity requirements and labor relations laws;\n\u2022\nextraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the FCPA;\n\u2022\neffects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nlabor force instability;\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability and uncertainty, including sovereign debt issues.\nViolations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.\nWe are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks.\nA substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in Europe and Japan. The U.S. Dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc or other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective or may create additional financial obligations for us. Further, if the counterparties to the derivative financial instrument transactions fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from those transactions.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations relating to the development, design, product standards, packaging, advertising, promotion, postmarket surveillance, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent, unpredictable and complex. The products we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other supranational, national, federal, regional, state and local governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances to market these products can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations and other supranational, national, federal, regional, state and local requirements globally. Compliance with these requirements, including the QSR, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulators, which may result in observations (such as on Form 483), and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement. If the FDA or another regulator were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such products, refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications, refuse to provide certificates for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. Furthermore, the FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that we may make about approved or cleared products. If the FDA determines that we have marketed or promoted a product for off-label use-uses other than those indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA-we could be subject to fines, injunctions or other penalties. The FDA or other regulators may also impose operating restrictions, including a ceasing of operations at one or more facilities, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products, seizure of products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA or other regulators could also issue a corporate warning letter or a recidivist warning letter or negotiate the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us, and/or recommend prosecution. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn August 2018, we received a warning letter from the FDA related to observed non-conformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the QSR at our Warsaw North Campus manufacturing facility. As of February 25, 2022, this warning letter remained pending. Until the violations are corrected, we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA as described above, the FDA may refuse to grant premarket approval applications and/or the FDA may refuse to grant export certificates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional information regarding these and other FDA regulatory matters can be found in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.\nGovernmental regulations outside the U.S. continue to become increasingly stringent and complex. In the EU, for example, the MDR became effective in May 2021 and includes significant additional premarket and post-market requirements. Complying with the requirements of this regulation requires us to incur significant expense. Additionally, the availability of EU notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited, which may delay the marketing approval for some of our products under the MDR. Any such delays, or any failure to meet the requirements of the new regulation, could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. Similarly, the separation of states from participation in the EU, such as through the cessation of the UK\u2019s membership in the EU (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and the separation of the Swiss and EU medical product markets with the adoption of MDR (commonly referred to as \u201cSwexit\u201d), may result in further regulatory risk and complexity as the former EU member or participant state establishes separate laws and regulations governing medical products.\nOur products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards Organization. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business could be harmed.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical products companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny around the world. Our industry is subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark law, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and similar laws and regulations in the U.S. and around the world. In addition, we are subject to various laws concerning anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters (including the FCPA), sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws are administered by, among others, the DOJ, the OIG-HHS, the SEC, the OFAC, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce and state attorneys general.\nWe are also subject to federal, state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal and protection of health-related and other personal information. The FDA has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices. The FDA and the DHS have also issued urgent safety communications regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities of certain medical devices, which vulnerabilities may apply to some of our current or future devices.\nIn addition, certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy, security and breach notification regulations promulgated under HIPAA. HIPAA governs the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by HIPAA \u201ccovered entities\u201d and their \u201cbusiness associates.\u201d Covered entities are health plans, health care clearinghouses and health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions. A business associate is any person or entity (other than members of a covered entity\u2019s workforce) that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information. HHS (through the Office for Civil Rights) has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with HIPAA regulations. On December 10, 2020, HHS issued an NPR to modify the HIPAA privacy rule. Separately, HHS (through the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology) issued a new rule, which took effect on April 5, 2021, that limits \u201cblocking\u201d of electronic health information. We intend to monitor both the NPR and the \u201cinformation blocking\u201d rule and assess their impact on the use of data in our business.\nIn addition to the FDA guidance and HIPAA regulations described above, a number of U.S. states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of personal information, such as social security numbers, medical and financial information and other personal information. These laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by U.S. federal laws. For example, several U.S. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individuals, and at times regulators, the media or credit reporting agencies, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information. Other state laws include the CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals numerous rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners. A second law in California, the CPRA, passed via a ballot referendum in November 2020. The CPRA expands the scope of the CCPA and establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency that will enforce the law and issue regulations. The CPRA is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023, with a lookback to January 1, 2022. Other states have considered and/or enacted similar privacy laws. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business.\nThe legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt privacy and data security laws. Outside of the U.S., data protection laws, including the GDPR in the EU (\u201cEU GDPR\u201d) and the UK (\u201cUK GDPR\u201d), the LGPD in Brazil, and the Personal Information Protection Law (\u201cPIPL\u201d) in China, also apply to our operations in those countries in which we provide services to our customers. The UK GDPR and EU GDPR impose, among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer UK and EU personal data, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year under the EU GDPR, and up to the greater of 17.5 million Pounds or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year under the UK GDPR). The issue of new standard contractual clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d) governing cross-border data transfers between controllers and processors by the EU Commission, in conjunction with related requirements on\nconducting data transfer impact assessments in respect of cross-border data transfers from the EU and the UK, may involve an increase in our costs of compliance as we transition to those SCCs and subject us to increased scrutiny by EU and UK regulators. The PIPL, which took effect on November 1, 2021, shares many similarities with the EU GDPR. This includes extraterritorial reach, strict restrictions on transfer of personal information (including in certain situations data localization or prior certification/authorization requirements), compliance obligations and sanctions for non-compliance (of up to 5% of annual turnover or 50 million Yuan). It also seeks to impose additional requirements not currently contemplated under the EU GDPR. The PIPL may increase our costs of compliance, subject us to enhanced scrutiny from Chinese regulators and affect our cross-border data transfers.\nThe interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. As discussed further in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the Durom\u00ae Acetabular Component (\u201cDurom Cup\u201d), certain products within the M/L Taper and M/L Taper with Kinectiv\u00ae Technology hip stems and Versys\u00ae Femoral Head implants, and the M2a-MagnumTM hip system. We are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to defend. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.\nWe are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights, and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.\nClaims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly. At any given time, we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation has in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology, processes, methodologies and information. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and nondisclosure, license, assignment and confidentiality arrangements to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights, as well as the intellectual property rights of third parties whose assets we license. However, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property, may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized use, misappropriation or theft of our intellectual property. Further, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information.\nIn addition, intellectual property laws differ in various jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to change at any time, which could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. In particular, a portion of our revenues is derived from jurisdictions where adequately protecting intellectual property rights may prove more challenging or impossible. We may also not be able to detect unauthorized uses or take timely and effective steps to remedy unauthorized conduct. To prevent or respond to unauthorized uses of our\nintellectual property, we might be required to engage in costly and time-consuming litigation or other proceedings and we may not ultimately prevail. Any failure to establish, maintain or protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nIn addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. For example, as discussed further in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, there have been four shareholder derivative actions filed purportedly on our behalf against certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain former stockholders of ours who sold shares of our common stock in secondary public offerings in 2016, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties and insider trading, based on allegations that we made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or omissions about our compliance with FDA regulations and our ability to continue to accelerate our organic revenue growth rate in the second half of 2016. Although we believe there are substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. Given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. We could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Documents and Jurisdiction of Incorporation\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Restated By-Laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.\nThese provisions provide for, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without further stockholder action;\n\u2022\nadvance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;\n\u2022\ncertain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nthe prohibition on engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for three years after the time at which a person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met, as set forth in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nOur Restated By-Laws designate certain Delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Restated By-Laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Restated By-Laws, as either may be amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and\nemployees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 89070, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "ZBH"}
