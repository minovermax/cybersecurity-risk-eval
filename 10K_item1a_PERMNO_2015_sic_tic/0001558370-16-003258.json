RISK FACTORS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nOur business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA substantial or extended decline in gold or copper prices would have a material adverse effect on Newmont.\nOur business is dependent on the prices of gold and copper, which fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence prices include:\n\u00b7\nGold sales, purchases or leasing by governments and central banks;\n\u00b7\nSpeculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold or copper;\n\u00b7\nThe relative strength of the U.S. dollar;\n\u00b7\nThe monetary policies employed by the world\u2019s major Central Banks;\n\u00b7\nThe fiscal policies employed by the world\u2019s major industrialized economies;\n\u00b7\nExpectations of the future rate of inflation;\n\u00b7\nInterest rates;\n\u00b7\nRecession or reduced economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries;\n\u00b7\nDecreased industrial, jewelry or investment demand;\n\u00b7\nIncreased import and export taxes;\n\u00b7\nIncreased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;\n\u00b7\nForward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions; and\n\u00b7\nAvailability of cheaper substitute materials.\nAny decline in our realized gold or copper price adversely impacts our revenues, net income and operating cash flows, particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to gold or copper sales. We have recorded asset impairments in the past and may experience additional impairments as a result of lower gold or copper prices in the future.\nIn addition, sustained lower gold or copper prices can:\n\u00b7\nReduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that have become uneconomic at sustained lower gold or copper prices;\n\u00b7\nReduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads and increase the likelihood and amount that the Company might be required to record as an impairment charge related to the carrying value of its stockpiles;\n\u00b7\nHalt or delay the development of new projects;\n\u00b7\nReduce funds available for exploration and advanced projects with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced; and\n\u00b7\nReduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices.\nWe may be unable to replace gold and copper reserves as they become depleted.\nGold and copper producers must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineral producing operations. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.\nWe may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore reserves from others related to development properties and operating mines. Such acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical operating results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. Other factors that affect our decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our assumptions for future gold or copper prices or other mineral prices and the projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or potential liabilities associated with the property and its operations and projections of how these may change in the future. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties and which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. Other than historical operating results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our revenue, our cash flow and other operating issues, as well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process used to estimate ore reserves. In addition, there may be intense competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.\nEstimates of proven and probable reserves and Mineralized Material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.\nThe reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold and copper that we estimated, at December 31, 2015, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold and copper and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results. Producers use feasibility studies to derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. Actual operating and capital cost and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time, the economic feasibility of production may change.\nAdditionally, the term \u201cMineralized Material\u201d does not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the SEC or the Company\u2019s standards. Estimates of Mineralized Material are subject to further exploration and development, and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Despite the Company\u2019s history of converting a substantial portion of Mineralized Material to reserves through additional drilling and study work, the Company cannot be certain that any part or parts of the Mineralized Material deposit will ever be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant reserves or that Mineralized Material can be economically or legally extracted.\nIn addition, if the price of gold or copper declines from recent levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, we can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves or Mineralized Material can be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our ore reserves\nhave become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves and Mineralized Material. Consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and Mineralized Material are less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position may be materially impaired.\nIncreased operating and capital costs could affect our profitability.\nCosts at any particular mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow.\nWe could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with the development of new projects in challenging jurisdictions and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond our control. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the profitability of and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects.\nEstimates relating to new development projects are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than estimated.\nMine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. Such projects could experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up.\nOur decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of feasibility studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors, among others:\n\u00b7\nChanges in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore to be mined and processed;\n\u00b7\nChanges in input commodity and labor costs;\n\u00b7\nThe quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made;\n\u00b7\nAdverse geotechnical conditions;\n\u00b7\nAvailability of adequate and skilled labor force;\n\u00b7\nAvailability, supply and cost of water and power;\n\u00b7\nFluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nAvailability and terms of financing;\n\u00b7\nDelays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development;\n\u00b7\nChanges in tax laws, the laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes due to the regional and national governments and royalty agreements;\n\u00b7\nWeather or severe climate impacts, including, without limitation, prolonged or unexpected precipitation and/or sub-zero temperatures;\n\u00b7\nPotential delays relating to social and community issues, including, without limitation, issues resulting in protests, road blockages or work stoppages; and\n\u00b7\nPotential challenges to permits or other approvals or delays in development and construction of projects based on claims of disturbance of cultural resources.\nOur future development activities may not result in the expansion or replacement of current production with new production, or one or more of these new production sites or facilities may be less profitable than currently anticipated or may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining.\nThe exploration for natural resources and the development and production of mining operations are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nEnvironmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals;\n\u00b7\nIndustrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of mining transportation equipment, milling equipment and/or conveyor systems and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of large-scale blasting operations, milling, processing and transportation of chemicals, explosions or other materials;\n\u00b7\nSurface or underground fires or floods;\n\u00b7\nUnexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form);\n\u00b7\nGround and water conditions;\n\u00b7\nFall-of-ground accidents in underground operations;\n\u00b7\nFailure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls;\n\u00b7\nSeismic activity; and\n\u00b7\nOther natural phenomena, such as lightning, cyclonic or tropical storms, floods or other inclement weather conditions.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development and production of mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.\nOur business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other extraterritorial and domestic anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and other collateral consequences and reputational harm.\nWe operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws and heightened expectations of enforcement authorities may be in tension with certain local customs and practices. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws with extraterritorial reach, including the U.K. Bribery Act, and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. We have an ethics and compliance program which includes our Code of Conduct, Business Integrity Policy and other policies and standards, all of which mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws by the Company and its subsidiaries and their personnel. Our program also includes a well-publicized hot line for raising issues and processes for investigating such issues and assurances of non-retaliation for persons who in good faith raise concerns. We report regularly to the Audit Committee of our Board\nof Directors on such program. There can be no assurance that Newmont\u2019s internal control policies and procedures will always protect it from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable laws and internal policies, recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company\u2019s affiliates, employees, agents or associated persons for which we might be claimed to be responsible. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. We occasionally identify or are apprised of information or allegations that certain employees, affiliates, agents or associated persons may have engaged in unlawful conduct for which we might be held responsible. Our policy when receiving credible information or allegations is to conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews to evaluate that information, determine compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations and company policies and take such remedial steps as may be warranted. In appropriate circumstances, we communicate with authorities in the United States and elsewhere about those investigations and reviews. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, loss of operating licenses or permits and other collateral consequences, and may damage the Company\u2019s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nShortages of critical parts and equipment may adversely affect our operations and development projects.\nThe mining industry has been impacted, from time to time, by increased demand for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, trucks, shovels and tires. These shortages have, at times, impacted the efficiency of our operations, and resulted in cost increases and delays in construction of projects; thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and production and construction schedules.\nMining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate, and are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nAs a result of public concern about the real or perceived detrimental effects of economic globalization and global climate impacts, businesses generally and large multinational corporations in natural resources industries, such as Newmont, in particular, face increasing public scrutiny of their activities. These businesses are under pressure to demonstrate that, as they seek to generate satisfactory returns on investment to shareholders, other stakeholders, including employees, governments, communities surrounding operations and the countries in which they operate, benefit and will continue to benefit from their commercial activities. Such pressures tend to be particularly focused on companies whose activities are perceived to have a high impact on their social and physical environment. The potential consequences of these pressures include reputational damage, legal suits, increasing social investment obligations and pressure to increase taxes and royalties payable to governments and communities.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop and operate mines and to successfully operate in communities around the world will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which we operate. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain government permits and approvals may adversely affect our operations, including our ability to explore or develop properties, commence production or continue operations. Key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be varied in a manner that adversely affects our operations, including our ability to explore or develop properties, commence production or continue operations.\nOur exploration, development, mining and processing operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing worker health and safety and land use and the protection of the environment, which generally apply to air and water quality, protection of endangered, protected or other specified species, hazardous waste management and reclamation. For example, in May 2015, the U.S. Department of the Interior released a plan to protect the greater sage grouse, a species whose natural habitat is found across much of the western United States. The U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s plan is intended to guide conservation efforts on approximately 70 million acres of national public lands, including in Nevada. No assurances can be made that restrictions relating to conservation will not have an adverse impact on our growth plans or not result in delays in project development, constraints on exploration and constraints on operations in impacted areas. During 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service engaged in an extensive review and considered whether the greater sage grouse would be placed on the endangered species list under protection of the Endangered Species Act. In late 2015, it was determined that the greater sage grouse would not currently be placed on the endangered species list. Nonetheless, federal land management agencies, including the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, may impose additional restrictions and mitigation obligations on development activities occurring on federal lands, which could also adversely impact our business.\nSome of the countries in which we operate have implemented, and are developing, laws and regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. We have made, and expect to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and burdens, and can cause delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, government permits and approvals which may adversely impact our closure processes and operations.\nFuture changes in applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, lead to the revocation of existing or future exploration or mining rights or otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. For instance, the operation of our mines in the United States is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (\u201cMSHA\u201d) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the \u201cMine Act\u201d). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Over the past several years MSHA has significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations and increased the dollar penalties assessed for citations issued. If MSHA inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines, penalties or sanctions and our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures. For example, in early July 2015, the Company\u2019s Leeville operation received 103(k) orders relating to ground control resulting in a temporary shut down of certain levels at Leeville. MSHA issued fines, penalties or sanctions and mandated temporary or extended closures could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. See Exhibit 95 to this report for additional information regarding certain MSHA orders and citations issued during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncreased global attention or regulation on consumption of water by industrial activities, as well as water quality discharge, and on restricting or prohibiting the use of cyanide and other hazardous substances in processing activities could similarly have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to increased compliance and input costs.\nWe have implemented a management system designed to promote continuous improvement in health and safety, environmental performance and community relations. However, our ability to operate, and thus, our results of operations and our financial position, could be adversely affected by accidents or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate.\nMine closure and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.\nNatural resource extractive companies are required to close their operations and rehabilitate the lands that they mine in accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Estimates of the total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs for gold and copper mining operations are significant and based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and mine closure plans that may change materially. For example, we have conducted extensive remediation work at two inactive sites in the United States. We are conducting remediation activities at a third site in the United States, an inactive uranium mine and mill site formerly operated by a subsidiary of Newmont.\nAny underestimated or unanticipated rehabilitation costs could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income attributable to Newmont stockholders in the related period. In addition, regulators are increasingly requesting security in the form of cash collateral, credit, trust arrangements or guarantees to secure the performance of environmental obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position.\nThe laws and regulations governing mine closure and remediation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. For a more detailed description of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters in Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRegulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProducing gold is an energy-intensive business, resulting in a significant carbon footprint. Energy costs account for approximately twenty percent of our overall operating costs, with our principal energy sources being purchased electricity, diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and coal.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. At the 18th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (\u201cUNFCC\u201d) held in 2012, Parties to the Kyoto Protocol agreed to a second commitment period of emissions reductions from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2020, which takes the form of an amendment to the Protocol. The 37 countries with binding targets in the second commitment period include Australia and all members of the European Union. Several Annex I Parties who participated in Kyoto\u2019s first-round have not taken on new targets in the second commitment period, including Japan, New Zealand and Russia. Other Annex I Parties without second-round targets are the United States (which never became a member to the Kyoto Protocol) and Canada (which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol effective 2012). At the 21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCC held in Paris in 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted which is intended to govern emission reductions beyond 2020. The Paris Agreement will open for signature in April 2016 to all 187 parties of the UNFCC: all members of the United Nations, as well as Cook Islands, Niue, Palestine and the European Union. It will enter into force (and then become fully effective) only if 55 countries that produce at least 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions ratify, accept, approve or accede to the agreement. While there are no immediate impacts to business from the Paris Agreement, the goal of limiting global warming to \u201cwell below 2o C\u201d will be taken up at national levels. Industrialized nations (e.g., Australia, United States) are likely to implement national emission reduction targets that require an investment shift towards low carbon technologies and systems, shifting away from coal and diesel power generation. The temperature change goal implies a move to net zero greenhouse gas emissions from energy use and industrial activities by 2050 to 2060. The relevant details of the shift towards low carbon technologies are defined in the national plans, which will need further definition in new rules from each country by 2020.\nSome of the countries in which we operate have implemented, and are developing, laws and regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. In December 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) issued an endangerment finding under the U.S. Clean Air Act that current and projected concentrations of certain mixed greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare. The United States is presently promulgating new EPA rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a result of the endangerment finding and has a five-year plan to reduce emission by 17% below 2005 levels by the year 2020. Additionally, the United States and China signed a bilateral agreement in November 2014 that committed the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by the year 2025. To date, U.S. regulations do not impose carbon tax on our operations but may in the future. Australia passed the Clean Energy Act in 2011 that sets up a mechanism to mitigate climate change by imposing a \u201ccarbon tax\u201d on greenhouse gas emissions and encourage investment in clean energy, which had the potential to impact our Australian operations. However, the Australian Clean Energy Act was subsequently repealed, thereby removing the related \u201ccarbon tax\u201d. The current legislation, Direct Action, remains to be defined and it is currently unclear if it will have a cost impact on our business.\nLegislation and increased regulation and requirements regarding climate change could impose increased costs on us, our venture partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. In August 2015, the EPA issued the final rules for the Clean Power Plan under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The Clean Power Plan is intended to reduce carbon emissions through EPA mandated reduction targets for each state. Nevada regulatory authorities are currently preparing Nevada\u2019s plan to comply with the EPA reduction targets. Newmont\u2019s TS Power Plant is currently subject to the requirements of the Clean Power Plan and could possibly be impacted by such requirements depending upon the compliance plan adopted by Nevada and approved by the EPA. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future requirements becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, financial position, results of operations and ability to compete.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. Operations that rely on national hydro-electric grid power can be adversely affected by drought resulting in power load-shedding and lost production. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.\nOur operations are subject to risks of doing business.\nExploration, development, production and mine closure activities are subject to regional, political, economic, community and other risks of doing business, including:\n\u00b7\nDisadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to the rigorous laws and regulations of the U.S. or other jurisdictions, including without limitation, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Dodd-Frank Act;\n\u00b7\nChanges in laws or regulations;\n\u00b7\nRoyalty and tax increases or claims, including retroactive increases and claims and requests to renegotiate terms of existing investment agreements, contracts of work, leases, royalties and taxes, by governmental entities, including such increases, claims and/or requests by the governments of Australia, Ghana, Indonesia, Peru, Suriname, the State of Colorado and the State of Nevada in the United States;\n\u00b7\nIncreases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located;\n\u00b7\nDelays in obtaining or renewing collective bargaining or certain labor agreements;\n\u00b7\nDelays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, necessary governmental permits, mining or operating leases and other agreements and/or approvals;\n\u00b7\nClaims for increased mineral royalties or ownership interests by local or indigenous communities;\n\u00b7\nExpropriation or nationalization of property;\n\u00b7\nCurrency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high inflation;\n\u00b7\nForeign exchange controls;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell gold offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such companies to hold U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts;\n\u00b7\nImport and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold and/or copper, such as the export restrictions on copper concentrate in Indonesia;\n\u00b7\nIncreases in costs relating to, or restrictions or prohibitions on, the use of ports for concentrate storage and shipping, such as in relation to our Boddington and Batu Hijau operations where use of alternative ports is not currently economically feasible or in relation to our ability to procure economically feasible ports for developing projects;\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to otherwise repatriate funds;\n\u00b7\nRisk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;\n\u00b7\nRisk of loss due to criminal activities such as trespass, local artisanal or illegal mining, theft and vandalism;\n\u00b7\nRisk of loss due to disease, such as malaria or the Zika virus, and other potential endemic health issues, such as Ebola;\n\u00b7\nDisadvantage and risk of loss due to the limitations of certain local health systems and infrastructure to contain diseases and potential endemic health issues;\n\u00b7\nRisk of loss due to inability to access our properties or operations;\n\u00b7\nDisadvantages relating to submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitration panels or enforcement or appeals of judgments at foreign courts or arbitration panels against a sovereign nation within its own territory; and\n\u00b7\nOther risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in contracts with government owned entities such as unilateral cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other mining rights.\nConsequently, our exploration, development and production activities may be affected by these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.\nOur Batu Hijau operation in Indonesia is subject to political and economic risks.\nWe have a substantial investment in Indonesia, a nation that since 1997 has undergone periods of financial crises and currency devaluation, outbreaks of political and religious violence and acts of terrorism, changes in national leadership, devolution of authority to regional governments, and the secession of East Timor, one of its former provinces. These factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts, regulatory changes that impose greater financial burdens, increased taxation and royalties (at both the national and regional level), denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets. In 2014, elections for the president of Indonesia and the national parliament were held and the new administration\u2019s policies pertaining to foreign investment remain under development. In regard to issues of resource nationalism, certain government officials and members of parliament may have a preference for government or domestic company ownership of Indonesia\u2019s mineral assets and mining operations, and the government has advocated policies intended to result in development of additional in-country processing and refining of minerals mined in Indonesia and restrictions on exportation, including the smelting and refining and exportation of copper concentrates.\nIn 2014, the Indonesian government issued new regulations pertaining to the export of copper concentrate that contain potentially restrictive conditions in respect of obtaining an export permit and impose a new export duty. The 2009 mining law preserves the validity of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara\u2019s (\u201cPTNNT,\u201d the entity operating the Batu Hijau mine) Contract of Work (the investment agreement entered into by PTNNT and the Indonesian government in 1986, which includes the right to export copper concentrates and a prohibition against new taxes, duties, and levies), and the Company believes and contended that these 2014 regulations were contrary to the Contract of Work. After PTNNT\u2019s Batu Hijau mine was shut down in June 2014 due to an inability to export copper concentrate and PTNNT and its majority shareholder filed for international arbitration, PTNNT and the government entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2014 in which, among other things, PTNNT agreed to pay higher royalties and certain export duties and the government agreed to issue permits to allow PTNNT to export and sell copper concentrates. The government then issued several six month export permits commencing in September 2014, March 2015 and November 2015. The most recent November permit was issued following a two month delay and expires in May 2016. PTNNT is continuing to work with the government to amend its Contract of Work to resolve ongoing issues pertaining to in-country smelting and refining and export of copper concentrate. However, due to the limited smelting and refining capacity in Indonesia, the 2014 regulations could result in the inability to export copper concentrate or additional financial obligations, which could adversely impact our future operating and financial results.\nViolence committed by radical elements in Indonesia and other countries and U.S. involvement in conflicts in the Middle East, may increase the risk that foreign operations owned by U.S. companies will be the target of violence. If our Batu Hijau operation were so targeted it could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur Batu Hijau operation faced demonstrations by the local community in 2011 and again in 2015 relating to a worker recruitment process, including protests and roadblocks. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur and the recurrence of significant opposition from the local community could disrupt mining activities and, thereby, adversely affect Batu Hijau\u2019s assets and operations. Batu Hijau also faced temporary work stoppages in 2011 and 2012. Indonesia has seen greater worker and union activism in recent times, and a strike or other labor disputes could adversely affect Batu Hijau\u2019s operations.\nWe are required to apply for renewals of certain key permits related to Batu Hijau. For example, PTNNT utilizes a submarine tailings placement (\u201cSTP\u201d) system. The STP system is operated pursuant to a permit from the government of Indonesia that was renewed in 2011 and expires in mid-2016. The inability to renew the STP permit, the export permit or other key permits would be expected to adversely impact Batu Hijau operations and may adversely impact our future operating and financial results.\nOur ownership interest in Batu Hijau has been reduced in accordance with the Contract of Work issued by the Indonesian Government and future reductions in our interest in PTNNT may result in our loss of control over the Batu Hijau operations.\nWe currently have a 31.5% direct ownership interest in PTNNT, held through Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V. (\u201cNTPBV\u201d), which is owned with an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan (\u201cSumitomo\u201d). We have a 56.25% interest in NTPBV and a Sumitomo affiliate holds the remaining 43.75%. NTPBV in turn owns 56% of PTNNT, the Indonesian subsidiary that owns Batu Hijau. In December 2009, Newmont entered into a transaction with P.T. Pukuafu Indah (\u201cPTPI\u201d), an unrelated noncontrolling shareholder in PTNNT, whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTPI in exchange for (i) a pledge of PTPI\u2019s 20% shareholding in PTNNT; (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax; (iii) a commitment to support the application\nof our standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine; and (iv) as of September 16, 2011, powers of attorney to vote and sell the PTNNT shares (only as further security for the financing arrangement in support of the pledge, and only enforceable in an event of default). On June 25, 2010, PTPI completed the sale of approximately a 2.2% interest in PTNNT to PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama (\u201cPTIMI\u201d), and, to effectuate PTPI\u2019s desire to sell the shares, Newmont entered into a transaction with PTIMI whereby we agreed to advance certain funds to PTIMI in exchange for (i) a pledge of PTIMI\u2019s 2.2% shareholding in PTNNT; (ii) an assignment of dividends payable on the shares, net of withholding tax; and (iii) a commitment to support the application of our standards to the operation of the Batu Hijau mine. Under the terms of the transaction, the Company has no powers of attorney or other right to vote PTIMI\u2019s shares. Based on the above transactions, Newmont recognizes an additional 17% effective economic interest in PTNNT. Combined with Newmont\u2019s 56.25% ownership in NTPBV, Newmont has a 48.5% effective economic interest in PTNNT and continues to consolidate Batu Hijau in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnder the Contract of Work executed in 1986 between the Indonesian government and PTNNT, 51% of PTNNT\u2019s shares were required to be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals by March 31, 2010. As PTPI owned 20% of PTNNT\u2019s shares at relevant times and an additional 24% stake in PTNNT had previously been divested, a final 7% stake was offered to the Indonesian government in March 2010. On May 6, 2011 we announced that a definitive agreement was signed with an agency of the Indonesian Government\u2019s Ministry of Finance for the sale of the final 7% divestiture stake. Subsequently, a dispute over the legality of the purchase under relevant laws and regulations arose between certain members of parliament and the Ministry of Finance, and the transaction never closed despite NTPBV and the agency repeatedly agreeing to extend the period for satisfying the closing conditions. Upon divestment of the 7% stake, our ownership interest in the Batu Hijau mine\u2019s production, assets and proven and probable reserves would reduce to a 27.5625% direct ownership interest as NTPBV\u2019s ownership interest in PTNNT would reduce to 49%, thus potentially affecting our ability to control the operation at Batu Hijau. We will also continue to hold, however, a 17% effective economic interest in PTNNT through the financing arrangements with existing shareholders described above, and we have identified Variable Interest Entities in connection with our economic interests in PTNNT due to these financing arrangements and shareholder commitments. Therefore, we expect to continue to consolidate PTNNT in our Consolidated Financial Statements after the final 7% sale is completed. Loss of effective control over PTNNT operations may result in our deconsolidation of PTNNT for accounting purposes, which would reduce our reported consolidated sales, total assets and operating cash flows. See Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the PTNNT share divestiture.\nAs part of the negotiation of the 2009 divestiture share sale agreements with PT Multi Daerah Bersaing (\u201cPTMDB\u201d), the nominee of the local governments, the parties executed an operating agreement (the \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d), under which each recognizes the rights of Newmont and Sumitomo to apply their operating standards to the management of PTNNT\u2019s operations, including standards for safety, environmental stewardship and community responsibility. The Operating Agreement became effective in February 2010 and will continue for so long as Newmont and Sumitomo collectively own more shares of PTNNT than PTMDB. If the Operating Agreement terminates, then Newmont may lose control over the applicable operating standards for Batu Hijau and will be at risk for operations conducted in a manner that detracts from value or results in safety, environmental or social standards below those adhered to by Newmont and Sumitomo.\nThe Contract of Work has been and may continue to be the subject of dispute, legal review, or requests for renegotiation by the Indonesian government, and is subject to termination by the Indonesian government if we do not comply with our obligations, which would result in the loss of all or much of the value of Batu Hijau.\nThe divestiture provisions of the Contract of Work have been the subject of dispute. In 2008, Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (the \u201cMEMR\u201d) alleged that PTNNT breached its divestiture requirements under the Contract of Work and threatened to terminate the Contract of Work if PTNNT did not agree to divest shares in accordance with the direction of the MEMR. The matter was resolved by an international arbitration panel in March 2009. The arbitration decision led to NTPBV divesting 24% of PTNNT\u2019s shares to PTMDB, the party nominated by the MEMR.\nAlthough the Indonesian government has not, since the 2008 arbitration, alleged that PTNNT is in breach of the Contract of Work, future disputes may arise under the Contract of Work. From time to time, some Indonesian government officials have advocated for the elimination of Contracts of Work and could instigate future disputes surrounding the Contract of Work, particularly given that Batu Hijau is a large business operated by a non-Indonesian company. Although any dispute under the Contract of Work is subject to international arbitration, there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such dispute and any termination of the Contract of Work could result in substantial diminution in the value of our interests in PTNNT. See Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the disputes involving the Contract of Work.\nIn January 2009, the Indonesian Government passed a new mining law. While the law preserves the validity of the Contract of Work, and therefore, PTNNT\u2019s right to operate Batu Hijau pursuant to the Contract of Work, in January 2014 the Indonesian\ngovernment issued new regulations pertaining to domestic processing and refining and the export of copper concentrate that contained restrictive conditions for export permits and a new export duty, which regulations conflict with the provisions of the Contract of Work. After PTNNT\u2019s Batu Hijau mine was shut down in June 2014 due to an inability to export copper concentrate and PTNNT and its majority shareholder filed for international arbitration, PTNNT and the government entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2014 that set out a framework for negotiating an amendment to the Contract of Work. PTNNT and the Indonesian government have not yet reached agreement on terms for an amendment to the Contract of Work and no assurances can be made in respect of the outcome of such negotiations or future permit renewals. Future disputes relating to the Contract of Work or the failure to obtain export permits could impact operating plans at Batu Hijau and adversely impact our future operating and financial results.\nOur operations at Yanacocha and the development of our Conga Project in Peru are subject to political and social unrest risks.\nDuring the last several years, Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (\u201cYanacocha\u201d), in which we own a 51.35% interest, and whose properties include the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga Project in Peru, has been the target of local political and community protests, some of which blocked the road between the Yanacocha mine and Conga project complexes and the City of Cajamarca in Peru and resulted in vandalism and equipment damage. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur in the future. The recurrence of significant political or community opposition or protests could continue to adversely affect Conga\u2019s development and the continued operation of Yanacocha.\nConstruction activities on our Conga Project were suspended on November 30, 2011, at the request of Peru\u2019s central government following increasing protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. At the request of the Peruvian central government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project, which was previously approved by the central government in October 2010, was reviewed by independent experts in an effort to resolve allegations around the environmental viability of Conga. This review concluded that the environmental impact assessment complied with international standards and provided some recommendations to improve water management. Yanacocha is currently focusing on the construction of water reservoirs prior to the development of other project facilities. However, development of Conga is contingent upon generating acceptable project returns and getting local community and government support. Under the current social and political environment, the Company does not anticipate being able to develop Conga for the foreseeable future. Given recent expiration of operating and construction permits and the related uncertainty around the renewal of those permits, as well as the deferral of the project, the Company has removed Conga from its Reserves statement and reclassified the project as Mineralized Material. Should the Company be unable to develop Conga, the Company may in the future reprioritize and reallocate capital to other development alternatives, which may result in an impairment of the Conga Project and further reclassification of the related Mineralized Material.\nThe Central Government of Peru continued to support responsible mining as a vehicle for the growth and future development of Peru in 2014. However, we are unable to predict whether the Central government will continue to take similar positions in the future. The regional government of Cajamarca and other political parties actively opposed the Conga Project and continue to reject the viability of its development. We are unable to predict the positions that will be taken in the future and whether such positions or changes in law will affect Yanacocha or Conga. Such changes may include increased labor regulations, environmental and other regulatory requirements, and additional taxes and royalties, as well as future protests, community demands and road blockages. We cannot predict future positions of either the Central or regional government on foreign investment, mining concessions, land tenure or other regulation. Any change in government positions or laws on these issues could adversely affect the assets and operations of Yanacocha or Conga, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, the inability to develop Conga or operate at Yanacocha could have an adverse impact on our growth and production in the region.\nIn addition, in early 2015, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the Ministry of the Environment (\u201cMINAM\u201d), issued proposed water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria would modify the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In 2015, MINAM issued the final regulation that modified the water quality standards and extended the compliance deadline. This law provides 60 days to notify whether the Company is able to comply with the new standards and one year to submit a modification to the previously approved Environmental Impact Assessment. A total of up to four years are allowed for permitting, detailed engineering, and construction of water treatment facilities required for compliance with the new water quality standards. Yanacocha is currently assessing treatment options in connection with the new water quality standards. Those treatment options may result in increased costs. If Yanacocha is unsuccessful in designing, constructing and implementing effective treatment options in the next four years, it could result in potential fines and penalties relating to potential intermittent non-compliant exceedances. These impacts may adversely impact the future cost, production and financial performance of our operations in Peru.\nOur business depends on good relations with our employees.\nProduction at our mines is dependent upon the efforts of our employees and, consequently, our maintenance of good relationships with our employees. Due to union activities or other employee actions, we could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us. At December 31, 2015, various unions represented approximately 41% of our employee work force worldwide. The collective bargaining agreements with the workforce in Ghana expired in 2014. The 2014 wage negotiations with the union in connection with the collective bargaining process concluded in September 2015 through arbitration after a prolonged negotiation. Wage negotiations in Ghana for 2015 wages remain ongoing. Batu Hijau also faced temporary work stoppages in 2011 and 2012, and the operation\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with the workforce expires at the end of 2016. Indonesia has seen greater worker and union activism in recent times and during those negotiations. The labor agreement in Peru will expire in April 2016 and the collective labor agreement in Nevada will expire in January 2019. A failure to successfully enter into new contracts could result in future labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. As such, there can be no assurance that any future disputes will be resolved without disruptions to operations.\nOur Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability.\nNewmont and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of certain of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. This leads to higher pit walls, more complex underground environments and increased exposure to geotechnical instability and hydrological impacts. As our operations are maturing, the open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper and we have experienced certain geotechnical failures at some of our mines, including, without limitation, in Indonesia at the Batu Hijau open-pit mine and at our operations in Australia, Nevada, Peru and Colorado.\nNo assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides and pit wall failures, will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material.\nGeotechnical failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of ore and other impacts, which could cause one or more of our projects to be less profitable than currently anticipated and could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nCurrency fluctuations may affect our costs.\nCurrency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur at our operations. Gold and copper are sold throughout the world based principally on the U.S. dollar price, but a portion of our operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The appreciation of those local currencies against the U.S. dollar increases our costs of production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the United States.\nThe foreign currency that primarily impacts our results of operations is the Australian dollar. We estimate that every $0.10 increase in the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate increases annually the U.S. dollar Costs applicable to sales by approximately $79 for each ounce of gold sold from operations in Australia before taking into account the impact of currency hedging. During the majority of 2015, the Australian dollar was relatively weaker than the U.S. dollar compared to 2014. The annual average Australian dollar exchange rate depreciated by approximately 7% from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. The annual average Australian dollar exchange rate further depreciated by approximately 17% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. We hedge a portion of our future forecasted Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures to reduce the variability of our Australian dollar exposure. At December 31, 2015, we had hedged 12%, 8%, and 4%, of our forecasted Australian denominated operating costs in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Our Australian dollar derivative programs will limit the benefit to Newmont of future decreases, if any, in the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rates.\nOur business requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to raise additional funding on favorable terms.\nThe construction and operation of potential future projects and various exploration projects will require significant funding. Our operating cash flow and other sources of funding may become insufficient to meet all of these requirements, depending on the timing\nand costs of development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices, our operational performance and our current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or a further dislocation in the financial markets as experienced in recent years, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing operations, retire or service all of our outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained.\nTo the extent that we seek to expand our operations and increase our reserves through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.\nFrom time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to provide increased returns to our shareholders and to expand our operations and reported reserves and, potentially, generate synergies. The success of any acquisition would depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nIdentifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms;\n\u00b7\nObtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially Newmont\u2019s shareholders;\n\u00b7\nMaintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nImplementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and\n\u00b7\nTo the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by energy shortages.\nOur mining operations and development projects require significant amounts of energy. Our principal energy sources are electricity, purchased petroleum products, natural gas and coal. Some of our operations are in remote locations requiring long distance transmission of power, and in some locations we compete with other companies for access to third party power generators or electrical supply networks. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations.\nWe have periodically experienced power shortages in Ghana resulting primarily from drought, insufficient rainfall, unavailability of thermal plants, shortage of fuel or other circumstances, increasing demands for electricity and insufficient hydroelectric or other generating capacity which caused curtailment of production at our Ahafo and Akyem operations in 2015. In late January 2015, in response to power shortages in Ghana resulting from insufficient rainfall and thermal plant unavailability, the Government of Ghana imposed a country-wide power reduction and notified the mining industry of the need to reduce power usage by 33%. In order to address shut downs and load shedding concerns, the Company engaged the power generating company and the Ministry of Power to produce alternative plans to help reduce our load shedding requirements. These alternative methods may cause increases in our diesel consumption and increase our costs. By year-end, the Company entered into a three-year power supply purchase agreement that provides the Company with a fixed percentage of power supply on a take-or-pay basis to reduce the potential future load reductions. Future power shortages or disruptions and increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nContinuation of our mining production is dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies to support our mining operations.\nOur mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Our operations in North and South America and Australia are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights, claims and contracts and to defeat claims adverse to our current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights, claims and contracts to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to our water rights, claims, contracts and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company\u2019s control. For example, the continuation of the below average rainfall or the occurrence of drought in southwest Australia could impact our raw water supply at Boddington. While we incorporated systems to address the impact of dry season as part of our operating plans, we can make no assurances that those systems will be sufficient to address all shortages in water supply, which could result in production and processing interruptions. The loss of some or all water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights could require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in our operations, thus adversely affecting our operations.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow and overall profitability.\nWe maintain insurance policies that mitigate against certain risks related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe are reasonable depending upon the circumstances surrounding each identified risk. However, we may elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for various other reasons; in other cases, insurance may not be available for certain risks. Some concern always exists with respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest, war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic crises are possible. These countries may also pose heightened risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption, increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and contracts. We do not maintain insurance policies against political risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects.\nA significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u00b7\nNegotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;\n\u00b7\nThe inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n\u00b7\nReduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;\n\u00b7\nFailure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;\n\u00b7\nInterruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n\u00b7\nFailure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and\n\u00b7\nProblems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues.\nIn addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to Newmont, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 30 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nTitle to some of our properties may be defective or challenged.\nAlthough we have conducted title reviews of our properties, title review does not preclude third parties from challenging our title or related property rights. While we believe that we have satisfactory title to our properties, some titles may be defective or subject to challenge. In addition, certain of our Australian properties could be subject to native title or traditional landowner claims, and our ability to use these properties is dependent on agreements with traditional owners of the properties. A determination of defective title or restrictions in connection with a challenge to title rights could impact our ability to develop and operate at certain properties, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. For more information regarding native title or traditional landowner claims, see the discussion under the Asia Pacific Section of Item 2, Properties, in this report.\nCivil disturbances, criminal activities, including illegal mining, and artisanal mining, occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties, which can disrupt business and expose the Company to liability.\nCivil disturbances and criminal activities such as trespass, illegal mining, sabotage, theft and vandalism may cause disruptions and could result in the suspension of operations and development at certain sites. Incidents of such activities have occasionally led to conflict with security personnel and/or police, which in some cases resulted in injuries including in Peru and Suriname. Although security measures have been implemented by the Company to protect employees, property and assets, such measures will not guarantee that such incidents will not continue to occur in the future, or result in harm to employees or trespassers, decrease operational efficiency or construction delays, increase community tensions or result in liabilities. The manner in which the Company\u2019s personnel, national police or other security forces respond to civil disturbances and criminal activities can give rise to additional risks where those responses are not conducted in a manner consistent with international and Newmont standards relating to the use of force and respect for human rights. Newmont takes seriously our obligation to respect and promote human rights, is a signatory to and active participant in the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, and has adopted a Sustainability and Stakeholder Engagement Policy and Human Rights Standard in-line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Nonetheless, although the Company has implemented a number of significant measures and safeguards which are intended to ensure that their personnel understand and uphold these standards, the implementation of these measures will not guarantee that personnel, national police or other security forces will uphold these standards in every instance. The failure to conduct security operations in accordance with these standards can result in harm to employees, community members or trespassers, increase community tensions, reputational harm to Newmont or result in criminal and/or civil liability and/or financial damages or penalties.\nArtisanal and illegal miners have been active on, or adjacent to, some of Newmont\u2019s African, Indonesian and South American properties, including recently at Suriname. Illegal mining, which involves trespass into the development or operating area of the mine, is both a security and safety issue, which may present a security threat to property and human life. The illegal miners from time to time have clashed with security staff and law enforcement personnel who have attempted to move them away from the facilities. Although, under certain circumstances, artisanal mining may be a legally sanctioned activity, artisanal mining is also associated with a number of negative impacts, including environmental degradation, poor working practices, erosion of civil society, human rights abuse and funding of conflict. The environmental, social, safety and health impacts of artisanal and illegal mining are frequently attributed to formal mining activity, and it is often assumed that artisanally-mined gold is channeled through large-scale mining operators, even though artisanal and large-scale miners may have separate supply chains. These misconceptions impact negatively on the reputation of the industry. The activities of the illegal miners could cause damage to Newmont\u2019s properties for which Newmont could potentially be held responsible. The presence of illegal miners could lead to exploration and project delays and disputes regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits. Illegal mining and theft could also result in lost gold production and reserves, mine and development stoppages, and have a material adverse effect on financial condition or results of operations or project development.\nCompetition from other natural resource companies may harm our business.\nWe compete with other natural resource companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We also compete with other natural resource companies for specialized equipment, components and supplies, such as drill rigs, necessary for exploration and development, as well as for rights to mine properties containing gold, copper and other minerals. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.\nWe recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. In the future, our estimates could change requiring a valuation allowance or impairment of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2015, the Company\u2019s long-term deferred tax assets were $1,718.\nReturns for investments in pension plans are uncertain.\nWe maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide for specified payments after retirement. The ability of the pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions. A sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. If future plan investment returns are not sufficient, we may be required to increase the amount of future cash contributions.\nAny downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could increase our future borrowing costs and adversely affect the availability of new financing.\nThere can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services or Moody\u2019s Investors Service to Newmont will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. In November 2013, Standard & Poor\u2019s lowered our credit rating from BBB+ to BBB, and, in June 2014, revised its outlook to negative from stable. In January 2014, Moody\u2019s Investors Service issued a notice that Newmont\u2019s debt had been placed on \u201cReview for possible downgrade.\u201d Subsequently in May 2014, Moody\u2019s Investors Service issued a notice that Newmont\u2019s debt has been downgraded to Baa2 with negative outlook. In June 2015, Standard & Poor\u2019s reaffirmed our credit rating at \u201cBBB\u201d rating and revised its outlook from negative to stable. In January 2016, the Company was one of 11 mining companies rated in the U.S. that was placed on review by Moody\u2019s Investor Services for potential downgrade. We cannot make assurances regarding the outcome of the rating agencies future reviews. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase our borrowing costs, which in turn could impair our results of operations and financial position.\nFuture funding requirements may affect our business.\nPotential future investments, including projects in the Company\u2019s project pipeline, acquisitions and other investments, will require significant funds for capital expenditures. Depending on gold and copper prices, our operating cash flow may not be sufficient to meet all of these expenditures, depending on the timing of development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities and pay dividends. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold and copper prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. In light of the limited global availability of credit, and given our existing debt position, we may determine that it may be necessary or preferable to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. Additional financing may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, any additional financing may involve substantial dilution to existing shareholders. In the event of lower gold and copper prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt and pay dividends could be significantly constrained.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.\nThe market price and volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are:\n\u00b7\nchanges in gold, and to a lesser extent, copper prices;\n\u00b7\noperating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in our business or in the mining sector generally;\n\u00b7\nregulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations;\n\u00b7\nthe operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock may not receive dividends.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock and utilized a gold price-linked dividend policy, we are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock and our Board of Directors may modify the dividend policy or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.", "PERMNO": 21207, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "NEM"}
