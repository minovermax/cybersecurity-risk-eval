RISK FACTORS\nVarious risks and uncertainties may affect the Company\u2019s business. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or the Company\u2019s other SEC filings may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Independent Business, Save-A-Lot and Retail Food segments face intense competition.\nThe grocery business is intensely competitive, and the recent and ongoing consolidation within the grocery industry is expected to result in increased competition, including from some competitors that have greater financial, marketing and other resources than the Company. The nature and extent to which the Company\u2019s competitors implement various pricing and promotional activities in response to increasing competition and the Company\u2019s response, or failure to respond effectively, to these competitive actions, in a grocery industry characterized by relatively small gross margins, can adversely affect profitability and the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s Independent Business segment is primarily wholesale distribution, which competes with traditional grocery wholesalers as well as specialty wholesalers on the basis of price, quality, assortment, schedule and reliability of deliveries, service fees and distribution facility locations. The profitability of the Independent Business segment is dependent upon sufficient volume to support the Company\u2019s operating infrastructure, which is dependent on the ability of the Company to attract new customers and retain existing customers, as well as the ability of the Company and its independent retail customers to distinguish themselves from competitors in the grocery channel. The Company\u2019s Independent Business segment also faces competition from retailers that maintain or develop self-distribution systems as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise. The inability to attract new customers, the loss of existing customers to a competing wholesaler or due to closure, vertical integration, or industry consolidation, or the inability of the Company\u2019s customers to compete successfully with other grocery retailers and non-traditional retailers may negatively impact the Company\u2019s sales and gross margin.\nThe Company\u2019s Save-A-Lot and Retail Food segments face significant competition for customers, managers, employees, store sites and products from traditional grocery retailers, including regional and national chains and independent food store operators, and non-traditional retailers, such as supercenters, membership warehouse clubs, specialty supermarkets, drug stores, discount stores, dollar stores, convenience stores, online retailers and restaurants. Competitors continue to increase their presence in the Company\u2019s markets, including certain non-traditional competitors that have entered the grocery retailing business. The Company\u2019s ability to differentiate itself from its competitors and create an attractive value proposition for its customers is dependent upon a combination of price, quality, customer service, convenience, assortment, in-stock levels, brand perception, store location and conditions, in-store marketing and merchandising and promotional strategies. Any failure to positively differentiate the Company\u2019s stores, as well as the inability to identify and respond to changes in economic conditions\nand trends in consumer preferences, could result in a loss of competitive position for the Company\u2019s retail stores in the markets they serve.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully identify and execute initiatives to increase its sales and profits.\nThe Company continuously evaluates the changing business environments in which the Company operates and seeks out opportunities to improve performance, customer service and growth through selected initiatives. The Company\u2019s ability to execute on these initiatives is dependent, in part, upon its ability to continue to provide a high level of customer service, offer competitive products at low prices, maintain high levels of productivity, become a more cost-efficient organization and offer services that provide value. The Company\u2019s ability to grow will also depend on many factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to attract new customers and licensees throughout the existing networks of distribution centers, the availability of attractive store locations, the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms, the ability to hire and train new personnel and political and economic conditions. Delays or failures in opening new locations, achieving lower than expected sales or achieving lower than expected returns on new stores or store remodels could adversely affect growth and profitability. Any initiatives that involve acquisitions or dispositions may entail various risks such as identifying suitable sellers or buyers, realizing acceptable rates of return on the investment or sale, negotiating acceptable terms and conditions and successfully integrating or separating operations and systems following the acquisition or disposition.\nThere are no assurances that the Company will be able to identify the appropriate course of action, including which initiatives will be the most effective in improving the competitive position of the Company, or that the Company will be able to respond appropriately to competitors\u2019 initiatives. If the Company is unable to execute on its initiatives, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company has substantial indebtedness that could increase the Company\u2019s borrowing costs and decrease the Company\u2019s financial and operational flexibility.\nThe Company has, and expects to continue to have, a substantial amount of debt. The Company\u2019s substantial indebtedness may increase the Company\u2019s borrowing costs and decrease the Company\u2019s business flexibility, making it more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions. For example, high levels of debt could:\n\u2022\nrequire the Company to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, new store growth, capital expenditures, acquisitions and for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain, or increase the cost at which the Company is able to obtain, financing in order to refinance existing indebtedness and fund working capital, new store growth, capital expenditures, acquisitions and for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to adjust to changing business and market conditions and to respond to market opportunities, placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors that have less debt.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s debt portfolio has a variable interest rate component. Volatility in interest rates causes volatility in interest expense, potentially resulting in an adverse impact to earnings. Additionally, pursuant to the Company\u2019s debt agreements, the Company has created a security interest in substantially all of its assets to secure certain debt instruments. The Company has also agreed to certain limitations on its ability to acquire or dispose of assets and is required to use the proceeds of such dispositions to pay down its debt, subject to certain exceptions. There are also various restrictive covenants and cross-default covenants in the Company\u2019s debt instruments that could limit the Company\u2019s operating and financial flexibility.\nIf the Company fails to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and the Company may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due. A default under the Company\u2019s debt instruments may also significantly affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional or alternative financing.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to comply with the covenants or to refinance the Company\u2019s obligations with respect to the Company\u2019s indebtedness will depend on the Company\u2019s operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. In particular, the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing through the capital markets may be adversely impacted by global economic conditions. Tightening of credit, low liquidity or volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit and higher costs of borrowing, making it more difficult for the Company to obtain debt financing on favorable terms. These conditions and\nfactors may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s debt ratings, which may increase the cost of borrowing, adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to access one or more financial markets or result in a default under the Company\u2019s debt instruments.\nAny of these outcomes may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of February 28, 2015, the Company is a party to 49 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 16,000 of its employees, of which eight collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 1,200 employees are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2016. In addition, during fiscal 2015, 19 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 11,700 employees were renegotiated. In fiscal 2015, four collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 800 employees expired without their terms being renegotiated. Negotiations are expected to continue with the bargaining units representing the employees subject to those agreements. In future negotiations with labor unions, the Company expects that, among other issues, rising healthcare, pension and employee benefit and wage costs and operational flexibility will be important topics for negotiation. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to negotiate the terms of expiring or expired agreements in a manner acceptable to the Company. Therefore, potential increases in operating costs or work disruptions from labor disputes could disrupt the Company\u2019s businesses and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Certain of the Company\u2019s operations have employees who are non-union, and while the Company believes its employee relations are strong, there can be no assurance that these operations will not experience pressure from labor unions or become the target of campaigns to unionize.\nIncreased healthcare, pension and other costs under the Company\u2019s and multiemployer benefit plans could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company provides health benefits to many of its employees and the costs to provide such benefits continue to increase annually. The amount of any increase or decrease in the cost of Company-sponsored health plans will depend on a number of different factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which has resulted in changes to the U.S. healthcare system. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposes new mandatory types of coverage and reporting and other requirements on Company-sponsored health plans, which have increased and the Company expects will continue to increase the Company\u2019s health plan costs over time.\nThe Company also sponsors defined benefit pension, defined contribution pension, and other postretirement benefit plans for substantially all employees not participating in multiemployer health and pension plans. The Company\u2019s costs to provide such benefits generally continue to increase annually. The Company uses actuarial valuations to determine the Company\u2019s benefit obligations for certain benefit plans, which require the use of significant estimates, including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs. Changes to these significant estimates could increase the cost of these plans, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe defined benefit pension plan sponsored by the Company is for pension obligations to current and former employees of the Company as well as some of its divested businesses. The Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan was closed for eligibility and frozen for credited benefit service for the vast majority of participants effective December 2007. In December 2012, that plan was frozen as to credited service and earnings for the vast majority of participants and, effective March 21, 2013 the plan was frozen for all remaining participants, although vesting service may continue to accrue. Participants who were employed by the Company or NAI on March 21, 2013 became vested in their pension plan benefit under the Company\u2019s defined benefit plan. Service at the Company (but not service at NAI) after that date will count toward eligibility for early retirement if applicable under the pension plan formula.\nThe projected benefit obligations of the Company-sponsored plans exceed the fair value of those plans\u2019 assets. Required contributions could increase due to a variety of factors, including lower pension discount rates, increased levels of underfunding, new mortality tables and new legislation.\nAdditionally, if the Company is unable to control healthcare benefits and pension costs, the Company may experience increased operating costs, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company participates in various multiemployer health and pension plans for a majority of its union-affiliated employees, and the Company is required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. The costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years. The amount of any\nincrease or decrease in the Company\u2019s required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if the Company chooses to exit a market. Withdrawal liabilities could be material, and potential exposure to withdrawal liabilities may influence business decisions and could cause the Company to forgo business opportunities. Increases in the costs of benefits under these plans, coupled with both performance below the plans\u2019 assumed rates of return in the equity and fixed income markets in past years and withdrawals of other companies from these plans, have caused most multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates to be underfunded. Many of these plans have required rehabilitation plans or funding improvement plans, and the Company can give no assurances of the extent to which a rehabilitation plan or a funding improvement plan will improve the funded status of the plan. The Company expects that the unfunded liabilities of these plans will result in increased future payments by the Company and the other participating employers over the next few years. Underfunded multiemployer pension plans may, in certain situations, impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions. The Company\u2019s risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan. A significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe financial condition of these pension plans may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s debt ratings, which may increase the cost of borrowing, adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to access one or more financial markets or result in a default under the Company\u2019s debt instruments.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s relationships with NAI, Albertson\u2019s LLC or Haggen could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn connection with the sale of NAI, the Company entered into the TSA with each of NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC to support the divested NAI banners and the continuing operations of Albertson\u2019s LLC. The TSA each had an initial term expiring on September 21, 2015, subject to annual renewal by notice given at least 12 months prior to expiration of the then current term. In September 2014, the terms of the TSA were renewed for an additional year and now end on September 21, 2016, unless renewed again by notice given by NAI and/or Albertson\u2019s LLC (or the Company with respect to the services it receives) no later than September 21, 2015.\nOn April 16, 2015, following discussions with NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC regarding the impact of Albertson\u2019s LLC\u2019s acquisition of Safeway, Inc. (the \u201cSafeway Acquisition\u201d) and their plans around winding down the TSA, the Company entered into a letter agreement regarding the TSA with NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC (the \u201cTSA Letter Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which the Company will provide services to NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC as needed to transition and wind down the TSA. The $50 million in aggregate fees under the TSA Letter Agreement are separate from and incremental to the fixed and variable fees the Company receives under the TSA. The Company estimates that the complete transition and wind down of the TSA could take approximately four years. This estimate is based on the information currently known to the Company and could change materially.\nThe transition and wind down of the TSA could be time consuming and resource intensive for the Company. The Company is working with NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC to coordinate what will be required to fully transition and wind down the TSA and over what timeline. This work will be on-going and could lead to disputes with NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC, including related to what services the Company must perform to transition and wind down the TSA, the manner or timeline in which these transition and wind down services are performed and the cost to perform these services which could cause disruptions and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe amount of revenue the Company receives under the TSA is based on the number of NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC stores and distribution centers receiving services under the TSA. Pursuant to the terms of the TSA, and at any time during the transition and wind down of the TSA, NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC may choose to not receive services at stores or distribution centers for any reason. As stores and distributions centers are removed from the TSA, the variable fee the Company receives under the TSA is reduced beginning ten weeks after the Company receives notice of such removal. The removal of stores or distribution centers before September 21, 2015 would also reduce the fixed fee the Company receives under the TSA during the one-year extension period (September 22, 2015 to September 21, 2016) and any future extension period(s). This reduction in the fixed fee occurs every year for stores and distribution centers removed before September 21 of that year.\nThe impact of the TSA on the Company\u2019s results of operations depends on the revenue being received by the Company and the Company\u2019s ability to manage its cost structure. The Company expects that the decline in TSA revenue from stores and distributions centers no longer receiving services under the TSA as part of the transition and wind down of the TSA will happen\nearlier than the decline in TSA services the Company is required to perform, which the Company expects will prevent it from being able to take out certain costs until some period of time after the TSA revenue declines. This timing difference creates challenges for the Company in managing its costs and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations in any given period.\nTo date, the Company has already developed plans to eliminate costs and to generate other services revenue streams (such as the Haggen TSA) that are expected to mitigate approximately two-thirds of the fiscal 2015 TSA revenue by the end of the estimated four year wind down of the TSA. The Company is developing additional plans to address the remaining one-third through other initiatives, including through further reductions in the Company\u2019s cost structure, growth strategies, additional investment in the business to accelerate revenue growth and, for a period of time, the incremental revenue from the TSA Letter Agreement to the extent the Company\u2019s costs are lower than the fees received; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to fully address the impact from the termination of the TSA.\nThe Company provides information technology services to the Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI stores under the TSA. Some stores owned and operated by Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI experienced criminal intrusions in connection with the criminal intrusions experienced by the Company in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The Company does not believe that any losses incurred by Albertson\u2019s LLC or NAI as a result of the intrusions would be the Company\u2019s responsibility; however, the Company is unable to assess the impact of such intrusions on the ongoing relationship between the Company and Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue to perform services under the TSA and the Transition Services Agreement with Haggen (the \u201cHaggen TSA\u201d) at the applicable service level, and to provide transition and wind down services for the TSA, will depend partly on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Retaining such personnel may be more difficult in connection with the transition and wind down of the TSA. A shortage of qualified employees who devote time to services under the TSA or the Haggen TSA could increase the Company\u2019s costs and decrease the Company\u2019s ability to effectively serve these customers. The Company could face claims for disruptions or other impacts to the businesses of NAI, Albertson\u2019s LLC or Haggen.\nThe Company continues to be in discussions with NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC regarding the $69 of discrete tax benefits that the Company recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 relating to tangible property repair regulations and, while the Company believes it is entitled to these tax benefits, whether the Company will pay any portion of the related tax refund to NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC. The Company is also a party to an Operating and Supply Agreement with NAI under which the Company operates a warehouse/distribution center owned by NAI. The Company provides wholesale distribution of products to certain NAI banners and to certain of the Company\u2019s independent retail customers from this warehouse/distribution center. This agreement may be terminated by either party on 24 months\u2019 notice. If the Company were not able to supply its independent retail customers from this warehouse, it would need to identify an alternative warehouse to service those customers and a delay or failure to do so could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn December 2014, the Company entered into the Haggen TSA to provide certain services to all 164 Haggen stores owned and being acquired by Haggen in five states in connection with the Safeway Acquisition as the stores are acquired by Haggen. The Haggen TSA is similar to the TSA supporting NAI and Albertson\u2019s LLC and has a term of two years with three one-year automatic renewal periods unless earlier notice of nonrenewal is given by either party. The Company\u2019s obligations under the Haggen TSA could impact the Company\u2019s ability to eliminate costs and overhead in connection with a transition and wind down of the TSA. Additionally, similar to the TSA, Haggen has the ability to remove stores from receiving services under the Haggen TSA, which would reduce revenue to the Company and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company experienced information technology intrusions in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and is not yet able to determine the full extent of their impact on its business and future operating results.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company experienced separate criminal intrusions into the portion of its computer network that processes payment card transactions for some of its owned and franchised retail food stores, including some of the associated stand-alone liquor stores. These intrusions may have resulted in the theft of account numbers, and in some cases also the expiration date, other numerical information and/or the cardholder\u2019s name, from payment cards used at some point of sale systems at some of the Company\u2019s owned and franchised stores.\nWhile the costs that the Company has incurred to date in connection with the intrusions primarily include professional advisory and legal costs relating to its continuing investigation of the intrusions, the Company expects to incur additional costs and expenses related to the intrusions in the future. The Company\u2019s investigation of the intrusions is ongoing, and it is possible that it will determine that information was in fact stolen from the Company during one or both of these intrusions or that time frames, locations, at-risk data, and/or other facts in addition to those currently known will be identified in the future, any of which could materially affect the Company\u2019s losses and cause reputational damage to the Company. The Company may also be\nadversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card brands, stockholders and others and by costly inquiries or enforcement actions on the part of regulatory authorities.\nThe Company has also expended significant time and resources on enhanced protective technology. The Company continues to take actions to implement further security enhancements and the Company is committed to continuing to improve its information security safeguards to protect its stores against intrusions. The time and resources devoted to enhancing the Company\u2019s information security can be disruptive to the day-to-day operations of the Company\u2019s businesses, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nSome stores owned and operated by Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI experienced related criminal intrusions. The Company provides information technology services to these Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI stores pursuant to the TSA, and the Company has been working together with Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI to respond to the intrusion into their stores. While the Company believes that any losses incurred by Albertson\u2019s LLC or NAI as a result of the intrusion affecting their stores would not be the Company\u2019s responsibility, the Company could face claims by Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI related to the intrusions, or other third parties seeking to hold the Company responsible for the intrusions into the stores of Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI. The Company also cannot be certain whether the intrusions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s relationships with Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI.\nThe Company is currently subject to private litigation and claims relating to the intrusions, and in the future the Company may be subject to additional litigation and claims and to governmental investigations or proceedings relating to one or both of the intrusions. The Company\u2019s financial liability arising from such litigation, claims, investigations or proceedings will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe results of the payment card brands\u2019 ongoing forensic investigations of the intrusions;\n\u2022\nwhether, at the time of the intrusions, the portion of its network that handles payment card data was in compliance with applicable payment card industry standards;\n\u2022\nwhether, and if so to what extent, any fraud losses or other expenses experienced by cardholders, card issuers and/or the payment card brands on or with respect to the payment card accounts affected by the intrusions can be properly attributed to these intrusions and whether, and if so to what extent, those expenses would be the Company\u2019s legal responsibility;\n\u2022\nthe nature and extent of any losses to Albertson\u2019s LLC or NAI from the intrusions and any claims asserted against the Company for such losses; and\n\u2022\nthe adequacy of the Company\u2019s insurance.\nDisruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology systems, including future cyber-attacks and security breaches, and the costs of maintaining secure and effective information technology systems could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe efficient operation of the Company\u2019s businesses is highly dependent on computer hardware and software systems, including customized information technology systems. Information systems are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists. The Company relies on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on the Company\u2019s information systems, and continues to invest in maintaining and upgrading the systems and applications to ensure risk is controlled. In response to the information technology intrusions the Company experienced in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company has taken and is continuing to take actions to strengthen the security of its information technology systems. Nevertheless, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches in the future. There can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer another intrusion, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to confidential or personal information, or that any such incident will be discovered promptly. The techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, and the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. The failure to promptly detect, determine the extent of and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason, including a major disaster or business interruption resulting in an inability to access data stored in these systems or sustain the data center systems necessary to support functions to meet Company needs, and any inability to respond to, or recover from, such an event, could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs, causing the Company\u2019s business and results of operations to suffer.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s businesses involve the receipt and storage of sensitive data, including personal information about the Company\u2019s customers and employees and proprietary business information of the Company and its customers and vendors. The Company may also share information with vendors that assist the Company in conducting its business, as required by law, with the permission of the individual or as permitted under the Company\u2019s privacy policy. As a merchant that accepts debit and\ncredit cards for payment, the Company is subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d), issued by the PCI Council. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to the Company\u2019s security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. By accepting debit cards for payment, the Company is also subject to compliance with American National Standards Institute data encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines. As a result of the intrusions, the Company engaged a new third party security firm to provide the Company a report on compliance with PCI DSS. This transition of security firms has delayed the Company\u2019s receipt of its report on PCI DSS compliance. Previously, a third party data security firm certified to the Company that it was compliant with PCI DSS version 2.0; however, the Company is now required to comply with the new PCI DSS version 3.0 and is currently engaged in the assessment process.\nDespite any certifications and the utilization of other information security measures, the Company cannot be certain that all of its IT systems or the IT systems of its vendors are or will be able to prevent, contain or detect any future cyber-attacks or security breaches from known malware, malware that may be developed in the future or otherwise. Cyber-attacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect, and therefore, the Company may be unable to anticipate these attacks or implement adequate preventive measures. Additionally, unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to the Company\u2019s or a vendor\u2019s systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deception involving the Company\u2019s employees or vendors. To the extent that any attack or breach results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, the Company may be adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card brands, stockholders and others and by costly inquiries or enforcement actions on the part of regulatory authorities. The Company\u2019s operations could also be significantly disrupted by these claims, as well as by the need to spend significant time and expense to upgrade, fix or replace its systems. The Company could also lose credibility with its customers and suffer damage to its reputation and future sales. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards, including PCI DSS version 3.0, and developing, maintaining and upgrading technology systems to address future advances in technology, could be significant and the Company could experience problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems.\nCustomers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop in stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary on their shopping experience, including prices. Multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving. If the Company does not keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments and technology investments by its competitors, the Company\u2019s ability to compete and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if the customer-facing technology systems do not reliably function as designed, the Company may experience a loss of customer confidence or data security breaches or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, which, if significant, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and results of operations.\nWorsening economic conditions could adversely impact consumer spending, increase costs of doing business or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe vast majority of the Company\u2019s store locations and customers are located in the United States, making its results highly dependent on U.S. consumer confidence and spending habits. In recent years, the U.S. economy has experienced economic recession, higher unemployment rates, higher energy costs, higher insurance and healthcare costs, a decline in the housing market, and greater restrictions on the availability of credit, all of which contributed to suppressed consumer confidence and increased price competition. While the U.S. economy and consumer confidence have improved recently, the sustainability of these improvements remains uncertain and consumers have continued to trade down to a less expensive mix of products that often yield lower margins and seek out discounters for grocery items. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify and respond to changes and trends in consumer spending and preferences and/or maintain the competitive position of its operations. Additionally, these economic factors along with higher interest rates, costs of labor and tax rates, and other changes in tax, healthcare and other laws and regulations, can increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. While economic conditions have improved and are showing less signs of volatility, there is continued uncertainty. In addition, inflation continues to be unpredictable; food deflation could reduce sales growth and earnings, while food inflation, combined with reduced consumer spending, could reduce gross profit margins. If these consumer spending patterns continue or worsen, and the economy does not continue to improve or it weakens, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to laws and governmental regulations that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices. These laws require the Company to comply with numerous provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food safety, marketing of natural or organically produced food, facilities, environmental, equal employment opportunity, public\naccessibility, employee benefits, wages and hours worked and licensing for the sale of food, drugs and alcoholic beverages, among others. The Company\u2019s inability to timely obtain permits, comply with government regulations or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance with governmental regulations may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business operations and prospects for future growth and its ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs. In addition, the Company cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can the Company determine the effect that additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on the Company\u2019s future business. They may, however, impose additional requirements or restrictions on the products the Company sells, require that the Company recall or discontinue sale of certain products, make substantial changes to the Company\u2019s facilities or operations, or otherwise result in changes to the manner in which the Company operates its businesses. Any or all of such requirements may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, the Company could be liable for the failure to properly dispose of hazardous waste and costs of removal or remediation of contamination at current or former locations. These costs could be substantial, and any failure to properly remediate such contamination may subject the Company to liability to third parties and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell or lease such property or to borrow money using such property as collateral.\nThe Company\u2019s supplier base includes domestic and foreign suppliers, and the Company has a limited number of licensed stores in foreign countries. Accordingly, political or financial instability in these foreign countries, changes in U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, or changes in the enforcement of those laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company is required to comply with laws and regulations governing ethical, anti-bribery and similar business practices. The Company may choose to pursue further expansion into international markets. If the Company seeks and attains a larger international footprint, it would be required to comply with additional foreign laws and regulations. Any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in civil and/or criminal sanctions and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFood and drug safety issues and related unfavorable publicity could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThere is increasing governmental scrutiny and public awareness regarding food and drug safety. The Company may be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the Company\u2019s food and drug products. Any events that give rise to actual or potential food contamination, drug contamination or food-borne illness or injury may result in product liability claims, penalties and enforcement actions from government agencies and a loss of consumer confidence. In addition, adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether valid or not, may discourage consumers from buying the Company\u2019s products or cause production and delivery disruptions, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. It may be necessary for the Company to recall unsafe, contaminated or defective products. Recall costs and product liability claims can be material. While the Company generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from its suppliers, it might not be able to recover these significant costs from its suppliers.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses may become subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to the risk of legal proceedings by employees, unions, consumers, customers, suppliers, stockholders, debt holders, governmental agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease consumer confidence in the Company\u2019s businesses, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether the Company is ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. See also \u201cItem 3 Legal Proceedings\u201d below.\nSevere weather and natural disasters may harm the Company\u2019s business.\nSevere weather conditions such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, extended winter storms or tornadoes, as well as other natural disasters, in areas in which the Company has stores, offices or distribution facilities or from which the Company obtains products may cause physical damage to the Company\u2019s properties, closure of one or more of the Company\u2019s stores, offices or distribution facilities, lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary disruption in the supply of products, disruption in the transport of goods, delays in the delivery of goods to the Company\u2019s distribution centers or stores, a reduction in customer volume and a reduction in the availability of products in the Company\u2019s stores. In addition, adverse climate conditions and\nadverse weather patterns, such as drought or flood, that impact growing conditions and the quantity and quality of crops yielded by food producers may adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within the grocery supply chain. Any of these factors may disrupt the Company\u2019s businesses and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruption to the supply chain and distribution network could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s sales and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s sales and operating results could be adversely impacted if the Company is not able to provide goods to the Company\u2019s stores and its customers\u2019 and licensees\u2019 stores in a timely and cost-effective manner, to maintain continued supply, pricing or access to new products or to identify alternative sources of merchandise without delay and at similar cost and quality levels. Factors that may disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply chain and distribution network include weather, product recalls, crop conditions, regulatory actions, political or financial instability for suppliers, transportation interruptions, labor supply or stoppages or vendor defaults or disputes, as well as other risk factors mentioned, any of which could also have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s sales and operating results. Disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could also negatively affect the Company\u2019s business.\nChanges in the military commissary system or decreases in governmental funding could negatively impact the sales and operating performance of the Company\u2019s military business.\nThe Company\u2019s Independent Business segment sells and distributes grocery products to military commissaries and exchanges in the United States. The Company\u2019s military business faces competition from large national and regional food distributors as well as smaller food distributors. Due to the narrow margins in the military food distribution industry, it is of critical importance for distributors to achieve economies of scale. Any material changes in the commissary system, the level of governmental funding to the Defense Commissary Agency (\u201cDeCA\u201d), military staffing levels, or the locations of bases may have a corresponding impact on the sales and operating performance of the Company\u2019s military business. Mandated reductions in government expenditures, including those imposed as a result of sequestration, may impact the level of funding to the DeCA and could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance and self-insurance programs may not be adequate to cover future claims.\nThe Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liabilities for workers\u2019 compensation, automobile and general liability, director and officer liability, property risk, cyber and privacy risks and employee healthcare benefits. The Company estimates the liabilities associated with the risks retained by the Company, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions, which, by their nature, are subject to a degree of variability. Any actuarial projection of losses concerning workers\u2019 compensation and general and automobile liability is subject to a degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, discount rates, rising health care costs, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and actual claim settlement patterns. For example, the Company believes that its insurance coverage will mitigate the financial impact of the criminal intrusions to the Company\u2019s information technology systems that it experienced in the second quarter of fiscal 2015; however, the Company cannot be certain that its coverage will fully mitigate the financial impact of the intrusions or that such coverage will not be disputed.\nSome of the many sources of uncertainty in the Company\u2019s reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels, medical fee schedules, medical utilization guidelines, vocation rehabilitation and apportionment. If the number or severity of claims for which the Company is self-insured increases, or the Company is required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than the Company\u2019s original assessments, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nVolatility in fuel and energy costs and risk associated with the Company\u2019s compressed natural gas program could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are dependent on the availability of a significant amount of energy and fuel to store and transport products. Energy and fuel costs are influenced by international, political and economic circumstances and have experienced volatility over time. To reduce the impact of volatile fuel and energy costs, the Company has entered into contracts to purchase fuel, electricity and natural gas at fixed prices to satisfy a portion of its expected needs. Additionally, the Company has invested in 60 semitrailer trucks powered by compressed natural gas, an increase of 25 from the original 35 semitrailer trucks in the pilot program launched in December 2013. In the recent past, the price of natural gas has been volatile, and this volatility may continue. Additionally, having compressed natural gas equipment and a fueling station entails inherent risks, including\nequipment defects, malfunctions and failures and natural disasters, which could result in flows of natural gas, fires, explosions and other damages, and could subject the Company to additional regulation. Volatility in fuel and energy costs that exceeds offsetting contractual arrangements, or failure to recognize the anticipated benefits from the compressed natural gas pilot program, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nImpairment charges for long-lived assets or goodwill may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company monitors the recoverability of its long-lived assets such as buildings and equipment and evaluates their carrying value for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Events that may trigger such an evaluation include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or the Company\u2019s plans for store closures. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the group of assets being tested.\nThe Company annually reviews goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred. Additionally, interim reviews are performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, the Company is required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made.\nThe testing of goodwill for impairment requires the Company to make significant estimates about its weighted average cost of capital, future revenue, profitability, cash flows, fair value of assets and liabilities, as well as other assumptions. These estimates may be affected by significant variability, including potential changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations and market strategies, changes in competition or changes in the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of the Company\u2019s future performance, may affect the fair value of goodwill, which may result in an impairment charge.\nThe Company cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of long-lived assets or goodwill become impaired, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors. These factors, some of which may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, include the perceived prospects and actual operating results of the Company\u2019s business; changes in estimates of the Company\u2019s operating results by analysts, investors or the Company; trading activity by our large stockholders; the Company\u2019s actual operating results relative to such estimates or expectations; actions or announcements by the Company or its competitors; litigation and judicial decisions; legislative or regulatory actions; and changes in general economic or market conditions. In addition, the stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations could reduce the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock for reasons unrelated to the Company\u2019s operating performance.", "PERMNO": 44951, "SIC": 5141, "TIC": "SVU"}
