{"cik": "845289", "company": "HARVEST NATURAL RESOURCES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to other information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating us.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nGeneral Risks Related to Our Business\nOur financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has not generated revenue and has incurred recurring losses as well as negative cash flow from operations that give rise to this concern. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOur cash position and limited ability to access additional capital may limit our growth and development opportunities. We have no recurring cash flows and our available cash may not be sufficient to meet capital and operational commitments for the next twelve months. To maintain the liquidity required to run our operations and capital spending requirement, we may attempt to improve our future cash position by effectuating a farm-down, selling or monetizing assets, or accessing debt or equity markets. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity and may limit our ability to grow through the acquisition or exploration of additional oil and natural gas properties and projects.\nOur common stock may not remain listed for trading on the NYSE. The NYSE has established certain quantitative and qualitative standards that companies must meet in order to remain listed for trading. We may not be able to maintain necessary requirements for listing, in which case our common stock may not remain listed for trading on the NYSE or any similar market. On December 2, 2015, we received notification from the NYSE that we had fallen below the NYSE's continued listing standards, which require a minimum average closing price of $1.00 per share over 30 consecutive trading days. Under the NYSE's rules, we have a period of six months from the date of the NYSE notice to bring our share price and 30 trading-day average share price back above\n$1.00. During this period, our common stock will continue to be traded on the NYSE, subject to our compliance with other NYSE continued listing requirements. As required by the NYSE, in order to maintain our listing, we have notified the NYSE that we intend to cure the price deficiency. If we are unable to cure the deficiency, the NYSE could delist our common stock and we may seek to be listed on an alternative exchange. While we have not yet received any notification from the NYSE, as of the date of this Report, we believe we may be in noncompliance with a second NYSE continued listing standard, which states that a company will be in noncompliance if its average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period is less than $50.0 million at a time when its stockholders\u2019 equity is less than $50.0 million. We believe the NYSE will give us an opportunity to cure this deficiency, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to cure or will be given such opportunity before the NYSE commences delisting procedures.\nOur business may be sensitive to market prices for oil and natural gas. We have made significant investments in our oil and natural gas properties. If we seek to sell the assets in our portfolio, to the extent market values of oil and natural gas decline, the valuation of the investments in these projects may be adversely affected.\nGlobal market and economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A general slowdown in economic activity could adversely affect our business by impacting our ability to access additional capital as well as the need to preserve adequate development capital in the interim.\nWe may not be able to meet certain contractual funding requirements. We may not have the funds available to meet the minimum funding requirements of our existing contracts when they come due and be required to forfeit the contracts.\nOur portfolio of hydrocarbon assets in known hydrocarbon basins globally is exposed to greater deal execution, operating, financial, legal and political risks. The environments in which we operate are often difficult and the ability to operate successfully will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to control the pace of development, our ability to apply \u201cbest practices\u201d in drilling and development, and the fostering of productive and transparent relationships with local partners, the local community and governmental authorities. Financial risks include our ability to control costs and attract financing for our projects. In addition, often the legal systems of these countries are not mature and their reliability is uncertain. This may affect our ability to enforce contracts and achieve certainty in our rights to develop and operate oil and natural gas projects, as well as our ability to obtain adequate compensation for any resulting losses. Our business depends on our ability to have significant influence over operations and financial control.\nRisks Related to Gabon Project\nWe impaired our offshore project in Gabon and we may need to record additional impairments in the future. Due to our liquidity situation we have not been able to commit to the development of our property in Gabon. If oil prices do not improve, we may not be able to obtain the necessary capital to develop Gabon and we may be required to record additional impairments relating to this asset. Currently the Company is considering alternatives with this property such as a farm-down or sale.\nThe capital required to develop our Gabon asset currently exceeds the Company\u2019s ability to finance such development and we may have to farm-down or consider an outright sale of the asset. Our ability to secure financing is currently limited and there may be factors beyond our control, which might hinder the marketability of this asset.\nRisks Related to Petrodelta\nWe do not directly manage operations of Petrodelta. PDVSA, through CVP, exercises substantial control over Petrodelta\u2019s operations, making Petrodelta subject to some internal policies and procedures of PDVSA as well as being subject to constraints in skilled personnel available to Petrodelta. These issues may have an adverse effect on the efficiency and effectiveness of Petrodelta\u2019s operations.\nWe hold a minority investment in Petrodelta. We are not able to exercise significant influence as a minority investor in Petrodelta and our control of Petrodelta is limited to our rights under the Conversion Contract and its annexes and Petrodelta\u2019s charter and bylaws. As a result, our ability to implement or influence Petrodelta\u2019s business plan, assure quality control, and set the timing and pace of development may be adversely affected. In addition, the majority partner, CVP, has initiated and undertaken numerous unilateral decisions that can impact our minority investment.\nPetrodelta\u2019s business plan will be sensitive to market prices for oil. Petrodelta operates under a business plan, the success of which will rely heavily on the market price of oil. To the extent that market values of oil decline, the business plan of Petrodelta may be adversely affected.\nA decline in the market price of crude oil could uniquely affect the financial condition of Petrodelta. Under the terms of the Conversion Contract and other governmental documents, Petrodelta is subject to a special advantage tax (\u201cventajas especiales\u201d) which requires that if in any year the aggregate amount of royalties, taxes and certain other contributions is less than 50 percent of the value of the hydrocarbons produced, Petrodelta must pay the government of Venezuela the difference. In the event of a significant decline in crude prices, the ventajas especiales could force Petrodelta to operate at a loss. Moreover, our ability to control those losses\nby modifying Petrodelta\u2019s business plan or restricting the budget is limited under the Conversion Contract. In 2015, Petrodelta was subject to the ventajas especiales and it may continue to be subject to this tax.\nOil price declines and volatility could adversely affect Petrodelta\u2019s operations and profitability, which in turn could affect cash available for dividends and profitability. Prices for oil also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and dividends from Petrodelta. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil that we can produce economically and lower oil production could affect the amount of natural gas we can produce. Prices have declined from June 30, 2014 through December 31, 2015 from approximately $86 to approximately $37 per barrel based on the Venezuelan export basket. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, oil price changes have been volatile. Factors that can cause fluctuations in oil prices include:\n\u00b7\nrelatively minor changes in the global supply and demand for oil;\n\u00b7\nexport quotas;\n\u00b7\nmarket uncertainty;\n\u00b7\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and policies;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic conditions in oil-producing and oil consuming countries; and\n\u00b7\noverall economic conditions.\nAn increase in oil prices could result in increased tax liability in Venezuela affecting Petrodelta\u2019s operations and profitability, which in turn could affect our dividends and profitability. Prices for oil fluctuate widely. In April 2011, the Venezuelan government published the Windfall Profits Tax which establishes a special contribution for extraordinary prices to the Venezuelan government of 20 percent to be applied to the difference between the price fixed by the Venezuela budget for the relevant fiscal year (set at $60 per barrel for 2015) and $80 per barrel. The Windfall Profits Tax also establishes a special contribution for exorbitant prices to the Venezuelan government of (1) 80 percent when the average price of the Venezuelan Export Basket (\u201cVEB\u201d) exceeds $80 per barrel but is less than $100 per barrel; (2) 90 percent when the average price of the VEB greater than or equal to $100 per barrel but is less than $110 per barrel; and (3) 95 percent when the average price of the VEB is greater than or equal to $110 per barrel. Any increase in the taxes payable by Petrodelta, including the Windfall Profits Tax, as a result of increased oil prices will reduce cash available for dividends to us and our partner, CVP.\nThe total capital required for development of Petrodelta\u2019s assets may exceed the ability of Petrodelta to finance such developments. Petrodelta\u2019s ability to fully develop the fields in Venezuela will require a significant investment. Petrodelta\u2019s future capital requirements for the development of its assets may exceed the cash available from existing cash flow. Petrodelta\u2019s ability to secure financing is currently limited and uncertain, and has been, and may continue to be, affected by numerous factors beyond its control, including the risks associated with operating in Venezuela. Because of this financial risk, Petrodelta may not be able to secure either the equity or debt financing necessary to meet its future cash needs for investment, which may limit its ability to fully develop the properties, cause delays with their development or require early divestment of all or a portion of those projects. This could negatively impact our minority investment. If we are called upon to fund our share of Petrodelta\u2019s operations, our failure to do so could be considered a default under the Conversion Contract and cause the forfeiture of some or of all our shares in Petrodelta. In addition, CVP may be unable or unwilling to fund its share of capital requirements and our ability to require them to do so is limited. Should PDVSA continue in insufficient monetary support and contractual adherence of Petrodelta, underinvestment in the development plan may lead to continued under-performance.\nThe legal or fiscal framework for Petrodelta may change and the Venezuelan government may not honor its commitments. While we believe that the Conversion Contract and Petrodelta provide a basis for a more durable arrangement in Venezuela, the value of the investment necessarily depends upon the Venezuelan government\u2019s maintenance of legal, currency, tax, royalty and contractual stability. Our experiences in Venezuela demonstrate that such stability cannot be assured. While we have and will continue to take measures to mitigate our risks, no assurance can be provided that we will be successful in doing so or that events beyond our control will not adversely affect the value of our minority investment in Petrodelta.\nPDVSA\u2019s failure to timely pay contractors could have an adverse effect on Petrodelta. PDVSA has failed to pay on a timely basis certain amounts owed to contractors that PDVSA has contracted to do work for Petrodelta. PDVSA purchases all of Petrodelta\u2019s oil production. PDVSA and its affiliates have reported shortfalls in meeting their cash requirements for operations and planned capital expenditures, and PDVSA has fallen behind in certain of its payment obligations to its contractors, including contractors engaged by PDVSA to provide services to Petrodelta. In addition, PDVSA has fallen behind in certain of its payment obligations to Petrodelta, which payments Petrodelta would otherwise use to pay its contractors, including Harvest Vinccler. As a result, Petrodelta is continuing to experience difficulty in retaining contractors who provide services for Petrodelta\u2019s operations. We cannot provide any assurance as to whether or when PDVSA will become current on its payment obligations. Inability to retain contractors or to pay them on a timely basis is continuing to have an adverse effect on Petrodelta\u2019s operations and on Petrodelta\u2019s ability to carry out its business plan.\nThe operating environment in Venezuela is challenging, with high inflation, increased risk of political and economic instability increased government restrictions, exchange rate restrictions and increased risks of enforcement actions by the United States Department of Justice. Going forward, additional government actions, political and labor unrest, or other economic headwinds, including the Venezuelan government's inability to fulfill its fiscal obligations and additional foreign currency devaluations, could have further adverse impacts on our business in Venezuela and our ability to fully realize the potential of our investment in Petrodelta. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cU.S. DOJ\u201d) has increasingly focused on investigating criminal matters involving Venezuela, typically involving allegations of corruption, money laundering, drug trafficking and other crimes by Venezuelan government officials. Specifically, late in 2015, the U.S. DOJ brought a case against United States companies for bribing procurement officials at PDVSA, the Venezuelan national oil company and the indirect 60% parent company of Petrodelta. The increased scrutiny by the U.S. DOJ and ongoing investigation into PDVSA, combined with the weakened Venezuelan government and unstable economic climate, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Strategic Relationship with CT Energy\nOur transaction with CT Energy may significantly dilute our existing stockholders. CT Energy may choose to fully convert the CT Warrant that we issued to CT Energy on June 19, 2015. CT Energy would own approximately 49.9% of our outstanding common stock following full exercise and the holdings of our other stockholders would be diluted. However, the CT Warrant will not be exercisable until the volume weighted average price of our common stock over any 30-day period equals or exceeds $2.50 per share, which means that stockholders other than CT Energy will have experienced significant share price appreciation prior to such exercise when compared to the $0.69 price per share of our common stock on May 8, 2015, the last trading date before we entered into the term sheet with representatives of CT Energy.\nAs a significant stockholder and debtholder of Harvest, CT Energy has significant influence over our actions and its presence may affect the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. CT Energy currently owns approximately 16.6% of our outstanding common stock. For so long as CT Energy is a significant stockholder and debtholder, CT Energy and its affiliates may exercise significant influence or control over our management and affairs, including influence or control beyond what is expressly permitted under the CT Energy transaction documents. CT Energy and its affiliates also will be able to strongly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval. In any of these matters, the interests of CT Energy and its affiliates may differ or conflict with those of other stockholders. Further, the high concentration of stock ownership in one stockholder may directly or indirectly deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes in control or changes in management, or limit the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in our best interests. The trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a significant stockholder and debtholder.\nAnti-dilution provisions in the securities we issued to CT Energy may make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future and may result in further dilution to our stockholders. The CT Warrant that we issued to CT Energy on June 19, 2015 contains customary full ratchet anti-dilution provisions. If triggered, these anti-dilution provisions will have the effect of lowering the price at which shares of our common stock are issued upon exercise of the CT Warrant, thereby increasing the number of shares received upon exercise. Accordingly, if we are unable to raise additional capital at an effective price per share that is higher than the exercise price of the CT Warrant, the anti-dilution provisions will make it more difficult and expensive to raise additional capital in the future. If triggered, these anti-dilution provisions also would result in further dilution to our stockholders.\nChanges in the fair value of financial instruments, particularly the securities we issued to CT Energy, may result in significant volatility in our reported operating results. We recorded an embedded derivative asset related to the 15% Note and a derivative liability related to the CT Warrant that we issued to CT Energy on June 19, 2015. Please see Part IV - Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule, Note 11 - Debt and Financing and Note 12 - Warrant Derivative Liabilities for further information. These financial instruments require us to \u201cmark to market\u201d (i.e., record the derivatives at fair value) as of the end of each reporting period as assets or liabilities, as applicable, on our balance sheet and to record the change in fair value during each period as a non-cash adjustment to our current period results of operations and in our income statement. These accounting classifications could significantly increase the volatility of our reported operating results, and the negative reporting implications may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future.\nWe may be unable to consummate the restructuring of Petrodelta as contemplated by the term sheet between HNR Finance and CVP and PDVSA. On July 14, 2015, HNR Finance, our majority-owned subsidiary, entered into a non-binding term\nsheet with CVP and PDVSA. The term sets forth a framework for definitive agreements that would govern the restructuring of the management and operations of Petrodelta. Because the term sheet is non-binding and subject to several conditions precedent, we cannot guarantee that HNR Finance will be able to consummate the transactions contemplated by the term sheet. Given the concentration of our assets in Petrodelta, our results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected if we are unable to consummate the restructuring of the management and operations of Petrodelta, as contemplated by the term sheet.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth. Actual production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures and operating expenses with respect to our reserves will likely vary from the estimates used, and these variances may be material.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues as of December 2014 and 2013 referred to in Part IV - Item 15 - Additional Supplemental Information on Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities (unaudited) for Petrodelta S.A., TABLE V - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Quantities is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves from our investment in Petrodelta. In 2015, we accounted for Petrodelta as a cost investment and did not provide this information. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on the unweighted average price of the first day of the month during the 12-month period before the ending date of the period covered by the reserve report and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any changes in demand, changes in our ability to produce or changes in governmental regulations, policies or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor. The effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the 10 percent discount factor. We did not have any proved oil and natural gas reserves in 2015, 2014 or 2013 except for our share of the reserves in Petrodelta.\nWe may not be able to replace production with new reserves. In general, production rates and remaining reserves from oil and natural gas properties decline as reserves are depleted. The decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics. Our future oil and natural gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. The business of exploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain. We may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We cannot give any assurance that our future exploration, development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs.\nOur future operations and our investment in Petrodelta, and our future operations and our development, sale or farm-down in Gabon, are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities. Oil and natural gas exploration and development drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found. The cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain. Oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nshortages or delays in the delivery of equipment;\n\u00b7\nshortages in experienced labor;\n\u00b7\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u00b7\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u00b7\nequipment or facilities failures or accidents;\n\u00b7\nremediation and other costs resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials;\n\u00b7\ngovernment actions or changes in regulations;\n\u00b7\ndelays in receiving necessary governmental permits;\n\u00b7\ndelays in receiving partner approvals; and\n\u00b7\nweather conditions.\nThe prevailing price of oil also affects the cost of and availability for drilling rigs, production equipment and related services. We cannot give any assurance that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable. Drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs.\nWe operate in international jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government and other officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot be assured that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from acts of corruption committed by our employees or agents. Any additional expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOperations in areas outside the United States are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. Our operations are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may include, among other things, loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation, nationalization, war, insurrection, civil unrest, strikes and other political risks, increases in taxes and governmental royalties, being subject to foreign laws, legal systems and the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or tribunals, renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities, changes in laws and policies, including taxes, governing operations of foreign-based companies, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign policy, foreign trade, taxation and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the United States.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations. Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations. These regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions. Matters regulated may include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations, bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. At various times, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and natural gas production. In order to conserve or limit supplies of oil and natural gas, these agencies have restricted the rates of the flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity. We cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations.\nWe are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include:\n\u00b7\nthe amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment;\n\u00b7\nresponse to unexpected releases to the environment;\n\u00b7\nreports and permits concerning exploration, drilling, production and other operations; and\n\u00b7\ntaxation.\nUnder these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs, natural resource damages and other environmental damages. We also could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses, and insurance may not protect us against all of these risks. We are not insured against all risks. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the risk of:\n\u00b7\nfires and explosions;\n\u00b7\nblow-outs;\n\u00b7\nuncontrollable or unknown flows of oil, natural gas, formation water or drilling fluids;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions or natural disasters;\n\u00b7\npipe or cement failures and casing collapses;\n\u00b7\npipeline ruptures;\n\u00b7\ndischarges of toxic gases;\n\u00b7\nbuildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials; and\n\u00b7\nvandalism.\nIf any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of:\n\u00b7\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u00b7\nsevere damage or destruction of property and equipment, and oil and natural gas reservoirs;\n\u00b7\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u00b7\ninvestigatory and clean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigation and penalties;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u00b7\nrepairs to resume operations.\nIf we experience any of these problems, our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not insurable.\nCompetition within the industry may adversely affect our operations. We operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete with major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and natural gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our strategy. We are a small organization and depend on the skills and experience of a few individuals in key management and operating positions to execute our business strategy. Loss of one or more key individuals in the organization could hamper or delay achieving our strategy.\nTax claims by municipalities in Venezuela may adversely affect Harvest Vinccler\u2019s financial condition. The municipalities of Uracoa and Libertador have asserted numerous tax claims against Harvest Vinccler which we believe are without merit. However, the reliability of Venezuela\u2019s judicial system is a source of concern and it can be subject to local and political influences.\nPotential regulations regarding climate change could alter the way we conduct our business. Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have begun adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that requires reporting and reductions of the emission of greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a by-product of the burning of oil, gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol address greenhouse gas emissions, and several countries including the European Union have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating and compliance costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce and as a result, negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. The proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. If these information technology systems fail or are interrupted, our operations may be adversely affected and operating results could be harmed. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the future growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. Our information technology systems, and those of third party providers, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control. These include catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, viruses or malware, physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. Any material disruption, malfunction or similar challenges with our business processes or information systems, or disruptions or challenges relating to the transition to new processes, systems or providers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 75734, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "HNR"}
