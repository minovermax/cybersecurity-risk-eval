RISK FACTORS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d These statements, which may relate to such matters as future earnings, growth, liquidity, supply and demand, costs, subsidiary performance, credit ratings, dividend payments, new technologies and strategic initiatives, often include words such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cassume,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201ccan,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cindicate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cproposed,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cwould\u201d or similar expressions. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. While we believe that our expectations are reasonable in view of the information that we currently have, these expectations are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties, and there are numerous factors-many beyond our control-that could cause actual results to vary materially from these expectations.\nSuch events, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in price, supply and demand for natural gas and related products; the impact of changes in state and federal legislation and regulation, including any changes related to climate matters; actions taken by government agencies on rates and other matters; concentration of credit risk; utility and energy industry consolidation; the impact on cost and timeliness of construction projects by government and other approvals, development project delays, adequacy of supply of diversified vendors, and unexpected changes in project costs, including the cost of funds to finance these projects and our ability to recover our project costs from our customers; limits on pipeline capacity; the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, including recent acquisitions in our retail operations segment; our ability to successfully integrate operations that we have or may acquire or develop in the future; direct or indirect effects on our business, financial condition or liquidity resulting from a change in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our counterparties or competitors; interest rate fluctuations; financial market conditions, including disruptions in the capital markets and lending environment; general economic conditions; uncertainties about environmental issues and the related impact of such issues, including our environmental remediation plans; the impact of the new depreciation rates for Nicor Gas; the impact of changes in weather, including climate change, on the temperature-sensitive portions of our business; the impact of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, on the supply and price of natural gas; acts of war or terrorism; the outcome of litigation; and the factors described in this Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and the other factors discussed in our filings with the SEC.\nThere also may be other factors that we do not anticipate or that we do not recognize are material that could cause results to differ materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise, except as required by law.\nGlossary\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is subject to substantial regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Adverse determinations by them and, in some instances, the absence of timely determinations, could adversely affect our business.\nAt the federal level, our business is regulated by the FERC. At the state level, our business is regulated by public service commissions or similar authorities, as well as local governing bodies with respect to certain issues.\nDepending upon the jurisdiction, these regulatory authorities are generally entitled to review and approve many aspects of our operations, including the rates that we charge customers (including the recovery of costs for pipeline replacement and other capital projects), the rates of return on our equity investments in our operating companies, how we operate our business, and the interaction between our regulated operating companies and other subsidiaries that might provide products or services to those companies. In addition, our operating companies are generally subject to franchise agreements that entitle them to provide products and services.\nWhile applicable law often provides a framework for the approvals that we need, the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion. Moreover, in some jurisdictions, the regulatory process involves elected officials and is subject to inherent political issues, which can impact the approvals that we request. As a result, we may or may not be able to obtain the approvals that we request, the timing of obtaining those approvals can be uncertain, and the approvals can be subject to conditions that may or may not be favorable to our business. Should we not be able to obtain the rate increases that we request in a timely manner, should we not be able to fully recover the costs that we incur, or should we otherwise not obtain favorable approvals for the operation of our business, our business will be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the regulatory environment in which we operate has increased in complexity over time, and further change is likely in many jurisdictions. These changes may or may not be favorable to our business. As the regulatory environment grows in complexity, inadvertent noncompliance is increasingly a greater risk. Noncompliance can, depending upon the circumstances, result in fines, penalties or other enforcement action by regulatory authorities, as well as damage our reputation and standing in the community, all of which would adversely impact our business.\nEnergy prices can fluctuate widely and quickly. To the extent that we have not anticipated and planned for those changes, our business can be adversely affected.\nRecently, the price for natural gas and competing energy sources, such as oil, have fluctuated widely. Generally, we pass through changes in prices to the customers of our operating companies, and we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our utility gas rates and to take appropriate action with the applicable regulatory authorities. However, there is an inherent regulatory lag in adjusting rates and, in an increasing price environment, we have to bear the increased costs on an interim basis. We also have to incur additional financing costs as a result of purchasing more expensive gas.\nIn addition, increases in gas prices, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative energy sources, negatively impacts demand, the ability of customers to pay their utility bills and the timing of those payments (which lead to larger accounts receivable and greater bad debt expense) and various other factors. While the impact of some of these factors can be passed through to customers, there is generally a delay in that process that can adversely affect our business.\nAs noted below, for some portions of our business, we hedge the risk of price changes through the purchase of futures contracts and other means. These efforts, while designed to minimize the adverse impact of price changes, cannot assure that result. As a result, we retain exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be extremely material and can adversely affect our business.\nGlossary\nVariations in weather beyond what we have planned for can adversely impact our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the transportation or sale of gas for space heating purposes. We plan for the demand of gas for this purpose based upon historical weather patterns and resulting demand. Where weather varies significantly beyond the range that we have planned for, it can impact us in many ways, including through increasing or decreasing the demand for gas, the cost of gas to us, and the availability, sufficiency and cost of transportation and storage capacity.\nA decrease in the availability of adequate pipeline transportation capacity due to weather conditions or otherwise could adversely impact our business. We depend upon having access to adequate transportation and storage capacity for virtually all of our operations. A decrease in interstate pipeline capacity available to us, or an increase in competition for interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity (e.g., even as a result of weather in regions that we do not significantly serve) could reduce our normal interstate supply of gas or cause rates to fluctuate.\nWe have WNA mechanisms for Virginia Natural Gas, Elizabethtown Gas and Chattanooga Gas that partially offset the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on residential and commercial customer billings and on our operating margin, although at Elizabethtown Gas, we could be required to return a portion of any WNA surcharge to its customers if Elizabethtown Gas\u2019 return on equity exceeds its authorized return on equity of 10.3%. These WNA regulatory mechanisms are most effective in a reasonable temperature range relative to normal weather using historical averages. Outside of those ranges, our financial exposure is greater.\nWe also have decoupled rate designs, including straight-fixed-variable, at Atlanta Gas Light, Virginia Natural Gas and Chattanooga Gas that allow for the recovery of fixed customer service costs separately from assumed natural gas volumes used by our customers. For more information, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d under the caption \u201cRate Structures\u201d herein.\nAt Nicor Gas, approximately 60% of all usage is for space heating and approximately 75% of the usage and revenues occur from October through March. Weather fluctuations have the potential to significantly impact operating income and cash flow. For example, we estimate that a 100 degree-day variation from normal weather of 5,752 Heating Degree Days impacts Nicor Gas\u2019 margin, net of income taxes, by approximately $1 million under its current rate structure. For our weather risk associated with Nicor Gas, we utilize weather derivatives to reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of lower operating margins potentially resulting from significantly warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois. For more information, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nChanges in weather conditions may also impact SouthStar\u2019s earnings. As a result, SouthStar uses a variety of weather derivative instruments to mitigate the impact on its operating margin in the event of warmer or colder-than-normal weather in the winter months. However, these instruments do not fully mitigate the effects of unusually warm or cold weather.\nSimilarly, changes in weather conditions may also impact wholesale services\u2019 earnings. In addition to the impacts described above, weather impacts the ability of our wholesale services segment to capture value from location and seasonal spreads. Through the acquisition of natural gas and hedging of natural gas prices, wholesale services reduces some of the weather-related risks that it faces, but it cannot eliminate all of those risks.\nOur retail energy businesses in Illinois, Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy, offer utility-bill management products that mitigate and/or eliminate the risks of variations in weather to customers. We hedge this risk to reduce any adverse effects to us from weather variations.\nWe are subject to environmental regulation and our costs to comply are significant. Any changes in existing environmental regulation could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, state and municipal laws and regulations. Such environmental regulation imposes, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations associated with storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of MGP residuals and waste in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental legislation also requires that our facilities, sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Our current costs to comply with these laws and regulations are significant. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and failure to obtain any required permits and licenses may expose us to material fines, penalties or interruptions in our operations.\nWe are generally responsible for liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the natural gas assets that we have operated, acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are or were known or unknown. In addition, in connection with certain acquisitions and sales of assets, we may obtain, or be required to provide, indemnification against certain environmental liabilities. Before natural gas was widely available, we manufactured gas from coal and other fuels. Those manufacturing operations were known as MGPs, which we ceased operating in the 1950s. A number of environmental issues may exist with respect to MGP\u2019s. For more information regarding these obligations, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein. Claims against us under environmental laws and regulations could result in material costs and liabilities.\nExisting environmental laws and regulations could also be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities. With the trend toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permit requirements and an increase in the number and types of assets operated by us subject to environmental regulation, our environmental expenditures could increase in the future, and such expenditures may not be fully recoverable from our customers. Additionally, the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions could give rise to expenditures and liabilities, including fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGlossary\nOur infrastructure improvement and customer growth may be restricted by the capital-intensive nature of our business.\nWe must construct additions and replacements to our natural gas distribution systems to continue the expansion of our customer base and improve system reliability, especially during peak usage. We may also need to construct expansions of our existing natural gas storage facilities or develop and construct new natural gas storage facilities. The cost of such construction may be affected by the cost of obtaining government and other approvals, project delays, adequacy of supply of vendors, vendor performance, or unexpected changes in project costs. Weather, general economic conditions and the cost of funds to finance our capital projects can materially alter the cost, the projected construction schedule and the completion timeline of a project. Our cash flows may not be fully adequate to finance the cost of such construction. As a result, we may be required to fund a portion of our cash needs through borrowings, the issuance of common stock, or both. For our distribution operations segment, this may limit our ability to expand our infrastructure to connect new customers due to limits on the amount we can economically invest, which shifts costs to potential customers and may make it uneconomical for them to connect to our distribution systems. For our natural gas storage business, this may significantly reduce our earnings and return on investment from what would be expected for this business, or it may impair our ability to complete the expansions or development projects.\nWe may be exposed to regulatory and financial risks related to the impact of climate change and associated legislation and regulation.\nClimate change is expected to receive increasing attention from the current federal administration, non-governmental organizations and legislators. Debate continues as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the potential causes of any change and its potential impacts. Some attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe EPA has begun using provisions of the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, differently than under historical precedent. Thus far, EPA has imposed greenhouse gas regulations on automobiles and implemented new permitting requirements for the construction or modification of major stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, including natural gas-fired power plants.\nIn addition, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum on June 25, 2013, directing the EPA to adopt performance standards to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Specifically, the Presidential Memorandum directs the EPA to propose standards for future power plants by September 20, 2013 and propose regulations and emission guidelines for modified, reconstructed, and existing power plants by June 1, 2014. The Presidential Memorandum directs the EPA to finalize those regulations by June 1, 2015. States would be required to develop regulations implementing the EPA\u2019s guidelines by June 30, 2016. It also includes a wide variety of other initiatives designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, prepare for the impacts of climate change, and lead international efforts to address climate change.\nThe outcome of federal and state actions to address climate change could potentially result in new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions, which in turn could:\n\u00b7\nresult in increased costs associated with our operations,\n\u00b7\nincrease other costs to our business,\n\u00b7\naffect the demand for natural gas (positively or negatively), and\n\u00b7\nimpact the prices we charge our customers and affect the competitive position of natural gas.\nBecause natural gas is a fossil fuel with low carbon content relative to other traditional fuels, future carbon constraints may create additional demand for natural gas, both for production of electricity and direct use in homes and businesses. The impact is already being seen in the power production sector due to both environmental regulations and low natural gas costs. However, methane, the primary constituent of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas. Future regulation of methane could likewise result in increased costs to us and affect the demand for natural gas, as well as the prices we charge our customers and the competitive position of natural gas.\nAny adoption of regulation by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. We cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations on our business.\nGlossary\nTransporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\nOur gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, including explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of our operations, which in turn could lead to substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe face increasing competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our revenues, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected, which may limit our ability to grow our business.\nThe natural gas business is highly competitive, increasingly complex, and we are facing increasing competition from other companies that supply energy, including electric companies, oil and propane providers and, in some cases, energy marketing and trading companies. In particular, the success of our retail businesses is affected by competition from other energy marketers providing retail natural gas services in our service territories, most notably in Illinois and Georgia. Natural gas competes with other forms of energy. The primary competitive factor is price. Changes in the price or availability of natural gas relative to other forms of energy and the ability of end users to convert to alternative fuels affect the demand for natural gas. In the case of commercial, industrial and agricultural customers, adverse economic conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could also cause these customers to bypass or disconnect from our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per-unit costs.\nOur retail operations segment markets fixed-price and fixed-bill contracts that protect customers against higher natural gas prices, or protect customers against both higher natural gas prices and colder weather. The sale of these fixed-price contracts may be adversely affected if natural gas prices are, or are perceived to be, low and stable. Our retail operations segment also faces risks in the form of price, convenience and service competition from other warranty and HVAC companies.\nOur wholesale services segment competes for sales with national and regional full-service energy providers, energy merchants and producers, and pipelines based on our ability to aggregate competitively-priced commodities with transportation and storage capacity. Some of our competitors are larger and better capitalized than we are and have more national and global exposure than we do. The consolidation of this industry and the pricing to gain market share may affect our operating margin. We expect this trend to continue in the near term, and the increasing competition for asset management deals could result in downward pressure on the volume of transactions and the related operating margin available in this portion of Sequent\u2019s business.\nOur midstream operations segment competes with natural gas facilities in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., as the majority of the existing and proposed high deliverability salt-dome natural gas storage facilities in North America are located in the Gulf Coast region. Competition for our Central Valley storage facility in northern California primarily consists of storage facilities in northern California and western North America. Storage values have declined over the past several years due to low gas prices and low volatility, and we expect this to continue in 2015.\nA significant portion of our accounts receivable is subject to collection risks, due in part to a concentration of credit risk at Nicor Gas, Atlanta Gas Light, SouthStar and Sequent.\nNicor Gas and Sequent often extend credit to counterparties. Despite performing credit analyses prior to extending credit and seeking to implement netting agreements, if the counterparties fail to perform and any collateral Nicor Gas or Sequent has secured is inadequate, we could experience material financial losses.\nFurther, Sequent has a concentration of credit risk with a limited number of parties. Most of this concentration is with counterparties that are either load-serving utilities or end-use customers that have supplied some level of credit support. Default by any of these counterparties in their obligations to pay amounts due to Sequent could result in credit losses that could be significant.\nWe have accounts receivable collection risks in Georgia due to a concentration of credit risks related to the provision of natural gas services to approximately 12 Marketers. As a result, Atlanta Gas Light depends on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenues.\nAdditionally, SouthStar markets directly to end-use customers and has periodically experienced credit losses as a result of severe cold weather or high prices for natural gas that increase customers\u2019 bills and, consequently, impair customers\u2019 ability to pay. For more information, see Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d under the caption \u201cCredit Risk\u201d herein.\nThe asset management arrangements between Sequent and our LDC\u2019s, and between Sequent and its non-affiliated customers, may not be renewed or may be renewed at lower levels, which could have a significant impact on Sequent\u2019s business.\nSequent currently manages the storage and transportation assets of our affiliates Atlanta Gas Light, Virginia Natural Gas, Elizabethtown Gas, Florida City Gas, Chattanooga Gas and Elkton Gas. The profits it earns from the management of those assets with these affiliates are shared with their respective customers and for Atlanta Gas Light with the Georgia Commission\u2019s Universal Service Fund, with the exception of Chattanooga Gas and Elkton Gas where Sequent is assessed annual fixed-fees. Entry into and renewal of these agreements are subject to regulatory approval, and we cannot predict whether such agreements will be renewed or the terms of such renewal.\nSequent also has asset management agreements with certain non-affiliated customers. Sequent\u2019s results could be significantly impacted if these agreements are not renewed or are amended or renewed with less favorable terms. Sustained low natural gas prices could reduce the demand for these types of asset management arrangements.\nGlossary\nWe are exposed to market risk and may incur losses in wholesale services, midstream operations and retail operations.\nThe commodity, storage and transportation portfolios at Sequent and the commodity and storage portfolios at midstream operations and SouthStar consist of contracts to buy and sell natural gas commodities, including contracts that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash. If the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate, we could experience financial losses from our trading activities. For more information, see Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d under the caption \u201cVaR\u201d herein.\nOur accounting results may not be indicative of the risks we are taking or the economic results we expect for wholesale services.\nAlthough Sequent enters into various contracts to hedge the value of our energy assets and operations, the timing of the recognition of profits or losses on the hedges does not always correspond to the profits or losses on the item being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in Sequent\u2019s reported results, even though the expected operating margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were initiated.\nThe cost of providing retirement plan benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the performance of investments, demographics, and various other factors and assumptions. These changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe cost of providing retirement plan benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of our pension fund assets, changing demographics and assumptions, including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and changes in health care cost trends. Any sustained declines in equity markets and reductions in bond yields will have an adverse effect on the value of our pension plan assets. In these circumstances, we may be required to recognize an increased pension expense and a charge to our other comprehensive income to the extent that the actual return on assets in the pension fund is less than the expected return. We may be required to make additional contributions in future periods in order to preserve the current level of benefits under the plans and in accordance with federal funding requirements.\nFor more information, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the caption \u201cContractual Obligations and Commitments\u201d and the subheading \u201cPension and Welfare Obligations\u201d and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 herein.\nNatural disasters, terrorist activities and similarly unpredictable events could adversely affect our businesses.\nNatural disasters may damage our assets, interrupt our business operations and adversely impact the demand for natural gas. Future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the U.S., and companies in the energy industry may face a heightened risk of exposure. The insurance industry has been disrupted by these types of events. As a result, the availability of insurance covering risks against which we and similar businesses typically insure may be limited or insufficient. In addition, the insurance we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms. In addition, an employee or third party may purposely, or inadvertently, fail to adhere to our policies and procedures or our policies and procedures may not be effective; this could result in the violation of a law or regulation, a material error or misstatement, damage to our reputation or the incurrence of substantial expense.\nWork stoppages could adversely impact our businesses.\nSome of our businesses are dependent upon employees who are represented by unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements may increase our costs, affect our ability to continue offering market-based salaries and benefits, and limit our ability to implement efficiency-related improvements. Disputes with the unions could result in work stoppages that could impact the delivery of natural gas and other services, which could strain relationships with customers, vendors and regulators. We believe that we have a good working relationship with our unionized employees and we remain committed to work in good faith with the unions to renew or renegotiate collective bargaining agreements that balance the needs of the company and our employees. For more information, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d under the caption \u201cEmployees\u201d herein.\nChanges in laws and regulations regarding the sale and marketing of products and services offered by our retail operations segment could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur retail operations segment provides various energy-related products and services. These include sales of natural gas and utility-bill management services to residential and small commercial customers, and the sale, repair, maintenance and warranty of heating, air conditioning and indoor air quality equipment. The sale and marketing of these products and services are subject to various state and federal laws and regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations could impose additional costs on, restrict or prohibit certain activities, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nGlossary\nConservation could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs a result of legislative and regulatory initiatives on energy conservation, we have put into place programs to promote additional energy efficiency by our customers. Funding for such programs is being recovered through cost recovery riders. However, the adverse impact of lower deliveries and resulting reduced margin could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nA security breach could disrupt our operating systems, shutdown our facilities or expose confidential personal information.\nSecurity breaches of our information technology infrastructure, including cyber-attacks, could lead to system disruptions or generate facility shutdowns. If a cyber-attack or security breach were to occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a cyber-attack could affect our ability to service our indebtedness, our ability to raise capital and our future growth opportunities.\nAdditionally, the protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to us. A breakdown or a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could occur and could expose us to liability to our customers, vendors, financial institutions and others. In addition, a breakdown or breach could also materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such risks. There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, although, to our knowledge, we did not have any material security breaches in 2014.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions, the success of which may impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have pursued acquisitions to complement or expand our business, divestures and other strategic transactions in the past and expect to in the future. If we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired businesses with our existing business and services. Acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, amortization expenses and substantial goodwill. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may cause dilution to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common shares. Any failure to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire in an efficient and effective manner could have a material adverse effect on us. Similarly, we may divest portions of our business, which may also have material and adverse effects.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We assess our long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset\u2019s carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the value of goodwill or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on our results of operations. No impairment of goodwill was recorded as a result of our 2014 annual impairment testing, as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value. Additionally, no impairment of long-lived assets was recorded during 2014.\nSince interest rates are a key component, among other assumptions, in the models used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units, as interest rates rise, the calculated fair values decrease and future impairments may occur. Further, the rates for contracting capacity at Jefferson Island, Golden Triangle and Central Valley are also key components in the models used to estimate their fair value. Consequently, a further decline in market fundamentals and the rates for contracting availability could result in future impairments. Due to the subjectivity of the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment analysis, we cannot provide assurance that future analyses will not result in impairment. These assumptions and estimates include projected cash flows, current and future rates for contracted capacity, growth rates, WACC and market multiples. For additional information, see Item 7,\u201dManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the caption \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d herein.\nGlossary\nRisks Related to Our Corporate and Financial Structure\nWe depend on access to the capital and financial markets to fund our business. Any inability to access the capital or financial markets may limit our ability to execute our business plan or pursue improvements that we may rely on for future growth.\nWe rely on access to both short-term money markets (in the form of commercial paper and lines of credit) and long-term capital markets as sources of liquidity for capital and operating requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations. If we are not able to access financial markets at competitive rates, our ability to implement our business plan and strategy will be negatively affected, and we may be forced to postpone, modify or cancel capital projects. Certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or affect our ability to access one or more financial markets. Such market disruptions could result from:\n\u00b7\nadverse economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nadverse general capital market conditions;\n\u00b7\npoor performance and health of the utility industry in general;\n\u00b7\nbankruptcy or financial distress of unrelated energy companies or marketers;\n\u00b7\nsignificant decrease in the demand for natural gas;\n\u00b7\nadverse regulatory actions that affect our local gas distribution companies and our natural gas storage business;\n\u00b7\nterrorist attacks on our facilities or our suppliers; or\n\u00b7\nextreme weather conditions.\nThe amount of our working capital requirements in the near term will primarily depend on the market price of natural gas and weather. Higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our operations.\nWhile we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and our available sources of financing, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future, especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near term. The future effects on our business, liquidity and financial results due to market disruptions could be material and adverse to us, both in the ways described above or in ways that we do not currently anticipate.\nA downgrade in our credit rating would require us to pay higher interest rates and could negatively affect our ability to access capital, or may require us to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties.\nOur senior debt is currently assigned investment grade credit ratings. If the rating agencies downgrade our ratings, particularly below investment grade, it may significantly limit our access to the commercial paper market and our borrowing costs would increase. In addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease.\nAdditionally, if our credit rating by either S&P or Moody\u2019s falls to non-investment grade status, we would be required to provide additional collateral to continue conducting business with certain customers. For additional credit rating and interest rate information, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the caption \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d under the caption \u201cInterest Rate Risk\u201d herein.\nWe are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt, which could lead to changes in interest expense and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. In order to maintain our desired mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, we may use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed-rate and variable-rate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements, without exchange of the underlying principal amounts. For additional information, see Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d under the caption \u201cInterest Rate Risk\u201d herein. However, we may not structure these swap agreements in a manner that manages our risks effectively. If we are unable to do so, our earnings may be reduced. In addition, higher interest rates, all other things equal, reduce the earnings that we derive from transactions where we capture the difference between authorized returns and short-term borrowings.\nWe are a holding company and are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, which may not be available in the amounts and at the times we need.\nA significant portion of our outstanding debt was issued by our wholly owned subsidiary, AGL Capital, which we fully and unconditionally guarantee. Since we are a holding company and have no operations separate from our investment in our subsidiaries, we are dependent on the net income and cash flows of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or other distributions to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends and make other distributions is subject to applicable state law and regulatory restrictions. In addition, Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. Refer to Item 5, \u201cMarket for the Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d herein for additional information.\nThe use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe use derivative instruments, including futures, options, forwards and swaps, to manage our commodity and financial market risks. We could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In addition, derivative contracts entered into for hedging purposes may not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these derivative instruments can involve management\u2019s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could adversely affect the reported fair values of these contracts.\nGlossary\nAs a result of cross-default provisions in our borrowing arrangements, we may be unable to satisfy all of our outstanding obligations in the event of a default on our part.\nOur credit facilities contain cross-default provisions. Should an event of default occur under some of our debt agreements, we face the prospect of being in default under our other debt agreements, obligated in such instance to satisfy a large portion of our outstanding indebtedness and unable to satisfy all of our outstanding obligations simultaneously.", "PERMNO": 15553, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "SO7"}
