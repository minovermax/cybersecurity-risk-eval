{"cik": "102198", "company": "CALMARE THERAPEUTICS Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to our Business and the Market Environment\nThe risk factors described below are not all-inclusive. All risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business, results of operations, and financial position. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements or risk factors. There may be other risks and uncertainties not highlighted herein that may affect our financial condition and business operations.\nWe derived more than 85% of our total revenue in 2015 from one technology.\nTotal revenue consists of revenue from product sales, retained royalties, and other income. We derived approximately $892,000, or 89.5%, of 2015 revenue from sales of our Calmare pain therapy medical device technology. An additional 4% of revenue derived indirectly from that technology through sales of supplies and training, rental payments and the sale of rental assets. A concentration of revenue makes our operations vulnerable to patent changes or expiration, or to variability in the medical device market, or to the development of new and competing technologies and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial position.\nIn the last five fiscal years, we incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows, and our ability to finance future losses is limited, and may significantly affect existing stockholders.\nThe Company has incurred operating losses since fiscal 2006 and has a working capital and shareholders\u2019 deficiency at December 31, 2015. At current reduced spending levels, the Company may not have sufficient cash flow to fund operations through 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments to reflect the possible future effect of the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its developing other recurring revenue streams sufficient to cover operating costs. If necessary, we will meet anticipated operating cash requirements by further reducing costs, issuing debt or equity, and/or pursuing sales of certain assets. The Company does not have any significant individual capital requirements in the budget going forward. To return to and sustain profitability, we must increase our revenue through sales of our Calmare Devices and other products and services related to the Devices.\nOur recent $15 million contract with the U.S. Government over five years will significantly improve our revenue streams. Failure to develop a recurring revenue stream sufficient to cover operating expenses would negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial position.\nOur current recurring revenue stream is insufficient for us to be profitable with our present cost structure. To return to and sustain profitability, we must increase sales revenue by further penetrating the U.S. market and expanding to other markets. We significantly reduced overhead costs with staff reductions across all company departments, reduced extraneous litigations, and obtained new technologies to build revenue. We will continue to monitor our cost structure, and expect to operate within our generated revenue and cash balances.\nFuture revenue is subject to many factors beyond our control. These include technological changes and economic cycles. Consequently, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable. Although we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts, we believe the combination of our cash on hand, and revenue from successfully executing our strategy will be sufficient to meet our obligations of current and anticipated operating cash requirements.\nOur exclusive, worldwide rights to sell the chronic pain reduction technology, marketed as Calmare, which accounted for 89% of our total revenue in 2015, will expire on March 31, 2016 unless action is taken by the Company.\nIn 2007, the Company entered into an agreement (the \u201c2007 Agreement\u201d) with Giuseppe Marineo (\u201cMarineo\u201d) and Delta Research and Development (\u201cDelta\u201d), Mr. Marineo\u2019s wholly-owned company, collectively (the \u201cParties\u201d), that secured the exclusive, worldwide sales and distribution rights to the science behind Calmare Pain Mitigation Therapy\u2122 (the \u201cTechnology\u201d). Today, this science is effectuated by the Company\u2019s flagship medical device - the Calmare Device. Sales of our Calmare Device continue to be the major source of revenue for the Company. In 2011, the Company\u2019s 2007 agreement was amended (the \u201c2011 Amendment\u201d) to extend the exclusivity rights afforded to the Company by the 2007 Agreement through March 31, 2016.\nIn July 2012, the Company and the Parties worked on a five-year extension to the 2011 Agreement (the \u201c2012 Amendment\u201d). However, the Company believes that the 2012 Amendment is neither valid nor enforceable as it was never duly signed or authorized and subsequently deemed null and void. Therefore, the Company\u2019s rights are determined by the 2011 Amendment which provides the Company with the exclusive rights to manufacture and sell the Calmare Device worldwide using the Technology. The Company is negotiating an extension to the 2007 Agreement.\nWe depend on government approvals to commercially develop our primary product.\nThe Calmare Device currently has a 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). Full commercial introduction in the United States will require an \u201capproval\u201d from the FDA. The FDA's approval process is rigorous, time consuming and costly. We may not be successful in obtaining FDA approval for the Calmare Device. In addition, we will require approval from foreign government agencies to commercially market the Calmare Device in those countries. We may not be successful in obtaining approval from individual foreign government agencies.\nWe and our customers depend on government and private insurance reimbursement to develop commercially viable medical products.\nSuccessful commercialization of medical products demands appropriate reimbursement rates from government and private medical insurance programs. In the US, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) sets reimbursement rates for medical procedures. Private insurance companies independently develop reimbursement rates for medical procedures as well. There is no assurance that rates will be set on the schedule or at the rates that we and our customers prefer. A lack of sufficient insurance reimbursement may cause customers to delay purchases of a new medical technology, pending the availability of reimbursement.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since 1981, and, our Board of Directors does not currently have plans to declare or pay cash dividends in the future. The decision to pay dividends is solely at the discretion of our Board of Directors based upon factors that they deem relevant, and may change at any time.\nOur shares are listed for trading on the OTC Marketplace, and our shares will likely be classified as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mean equity securities with a price less than $5.00. Our shares will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock.\nWe are subject to the penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that require brokers to provide extensive disclosure to its customers prior to executing trades in penny stocks. These disclosure requirements may cause a reduction in the trading activity of our common stock, which in all likelihood would make it difficult for our stockholders to sell their securities.\nUnder the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or accredited investor must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale, unless the broker-dealer is otherwise exempt. Generally, an individual with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000, or annual income exceeding $200,000 individually, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse, is considered an accredited investor. In addition, under the penny stock regulations the broker-dealer is required to:\n\u00b7 Deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt;\n\u00b7 Disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities;\n\u00b7 Send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer\u2019s account, the account\u2019s value and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks;\n\u00b7 Make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction, prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer\u2019s account.\nBecause of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of selling stockholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities. In addition, the liquidity for our securities may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. Our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our stockholders will, in all likelihood, find it difficult to sell their securities.\nOur common stock is subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting us or our competitors. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe OTC Marketplace is a quotation system, not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Therefore, buying and selling stock on the Pinks is not as efficient as buying and selling stock through an exchange. As a result, it may be difficult for you to sell your common stock or you may not be able to sell your common stock for an optimum trading price.\nThe OTC Marketplace is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume limitations in over-the-counter securities. Nevertheless, because trades and quotations on the OTC Marketplace involve a manual process, the market information for such securities cannot be guaranteed. In addition, quote information, or even firm quotes, may not be available. The manual execution process may delay order processing and intervening price fluctuations may result in the failure of a limit order to execute or the execution of a market order at a significantly different price. Execution of trades, execution reporting and the delivery of legal trade confirmations may be delayed significantly. Consequently, one may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at the optimum trading prices.\nWhen fewer shares of a security are being traded on the OTC Marketplace, volatility of prices may increase and price movement may outpace the ability to deliver accurate quote information. Lower trading volumes in a security may result in a lower likelihood of an individual\u2019s orders being executed, and current prices may differ significantly from the price one was quoted by the Pinks at the time of the order entry. Orders for OTC Marketplace securities may be canceled or edited like orders for other securities. All requests to change or cancel an order must be submitted to, received and processed by the OTC Pink. Due to the manual order processing involved in handling OTC Marketplace trades, order processing and reporting may be delayed, and an individual may not be able to cancel or edit his order. Consequently, one may not be able to sell shares of common stock at the optimum trading prices.\nThe dealer\u2019s spread (the difference between the bid and ask prices) may be large and may result in substantial losses to the seller of securities on the OTC Marketplace if the common stock or other security must be sold immediately. Further, purchasers of securities may incur an immediate \u201cpaper\u201d loss due to the price spread. Moreover, dealers trading on the OTC Marketplace may not have a bid price for securities bought and sold through the OTC Marketplace. Due to the foregoing, demand for securities that are traded through the OTC Marketplace may be decreased or eliminated.\nWe anticipate the need to sell additional authorized shares in the future. This will result in a dilution to our existing shareholders and a corresponding reduction in their percentage ownership in the Company.\nWe may seek additional funds through the sale of our common stock. This will result in a dilution effect to our shareholders whereby their percentage ownership interest in the Company is reduced. The magnitude of this dilution effect will be determined by the number of shares we will have to issue in the future to obtain the funds required. The sale of additional stock to new shareholders will reduce the ownership position of the current shareholders. The price of each share outstanding common share may decrease in the event we sell additional shares.\nSince our securities are subject to penny stock rules, you may have difficulty reselling your shares.\nOur shares are considered \u201cpenny stocks\u201d and are covered by Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell our securities including the delivery of a standardized disclosure document; disclosure and confirmation of quotation prices; disclosure of compensation the broker/dealer receives; and, furnishing monthly account statements. For sales of our securities, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination and receive from its customer a written agreement prior to making a sale. The imposition of the foregoing additional sales practices could adversely affect a shareholder's ability to dispose of his stock.", "PERMNO": 66368, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "CTTC"}
