Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect the Company's business, financial position and results of operations. The risks that the Company has highlighted in the following section of this report are not the only ones that the Company faces.\nThe Company's business involves various risks and uncertainties which are based on the lines of business the Company writes as well as more global risks associated with the general business and insurance industry environments.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions, Market Conditions and Investments\nVolatile financial markets and adverse economic environments can impact financial market risk as well as the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial markets in the U.S. and elsewhere can experience extreme volatility and disruption for uncertain periods of time. During such times, stresses affecting the global banking system can lead to economic volatility which can exert significant downward pressure on prices of equity securities and many other investment asset classes and result in substantially increased market volatility, severely constrained credit and capital markets, particularly for financial institutions, and an overall loss of investor confidence.\nMany states and local governments can also be impacted by adverse economic conditions which could have an impact on both the Company's niche market and its investment portfolio. Like other financial institutions which face significant financial market risk in their operations, the Company was adversely affected by these conditions and could be adversely impacted by similar circumstances in the future. The Company's ability to access the capital markets to refinance outstanding indebtedness or raise capital could be impaired during significant financial market disruptions.\nAs discussed further in subsequent risk factors, in addition to the effects of financial markets volatility, a prolonged economic recession may have other adverse impacts on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company's investment strategy is not successful, the Company could suffer unexpected losses.\nThe success of the Company's investment strategy is crucial to the success of its business. Specifically, the Company's fixed maturity securities portfolio is subject to a number of risks including:\n\u2022\ninterest rate risk, which is the risk that interest rates will decline and funds reinvested will earn less than expected;\n\u2022\nmarket value risk, which is the risk that invested assets will decrease in value due to changes in yields realized on the assets and prevailing market yields for similar assets, an unfavorable change in the liquidity of the asset or an unfavorable change in the financial prospects or a downgrade in the credit rating of the issuer of the asset;\n\u2022\ncredit risk, which is the risk that the value of certain investments become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of those instruments or the deterioration in performance or credit quality of the underlying collateral of certain structured securities and, ultimately, the risk of permanent loss in the event of default by an issuer or underlying credit;\n\u2022\nmarket fundamentals risk, which is the risk that there are changes in the market that can have an unfavorable impact on securities valuation such as availability of credit in the capital markets, re-pricing of credit risk, reduced market liquidity due to broker-dealers' unwillingness to hold inventory, and increased market volatility;\n\u2022\nconcentration risk, which is the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of deterioration in the financial condition of those issuers or the market value of their securities;\n\u2022\nliquidity risk, which is the risk that liabilities are surrendered or mature sooner than anticipated requiring the sale of assets at an undesirable time to provide for policyholder surrenders, withdrawals or claims; and\n\u2022\nregulatory risk, which is the risk that regulatory bodies or governments, in the U.S. or in other countries, may make substantial investments or take significant ownership positions in, or ultimately nationalize, financial institutions or other issuers of securities held in the Company's investment portfolio, which could adversely impact the seniority or contractual terms of the securities. Regulatory risk could also come from changes in tax laws or bankruptcy laws that would adversely impact the valuation and/or after tax yields of certain invested assets.\nIn addition to significant steps taken to attempt to mitigate these risks through the Company's investment guidelines, policies and procedures, the Company also attempts to mitigate these risks through product pricing, product features and the establishment of policy reserves, but it cannot provide assurance\nthat assets will be properly matched to meet anticipated liabilities or that the investments will provide sufficient returns to enable satisfaction of guaranteed fixed benefit obligations.\nThe Company's investment strategy and guidelines have resulted in an investment portfolio which is comprised primarily of investment grade, fixed maturity securities. Inclusion of alternative investments, although consistent with the Company's overall conservative investment guidelines, could result in some volatility in the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Company could enter into foreign currency, interest rate, credit derivative and other hedging transactions in an effort to manage risks, including risks that may be attributable to any new products offered by the Company. For instance, the Company utilizes call options to manage interest crediting risk related to its FIA and IUL products. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will successfully structure derivatives and hedges so as to effectively manage risks. If the Company's calculations are incorrect, or if it does not properly structure derivatives or hedges, it may have unexpected losses that may require it to draw on surplus, which could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the Company's defined benefit pension plan has been frozen since 2002, declining financial markets could also cause, and in the past have caused, the value of the investments in this plan to decrease, resulting in additional pension expense, a reduction in other comprehensive income and an increase in required contributions to this plan, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe determination of fair value of the Company's fixed maturity securities portfolio includes methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe determination of fair values is made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. The use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. During periods of market disruption, including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. In such cases, fair value determination may require more subjectivity and management judgment and those fair values may differ materially from the value at which the investments ultimately could be sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. The difference between fair value and amortized cost, net of applicable deferred income taxes and the related impact on deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) associated with investment (annuity) contracts and life insurance products with account values, and interest-sensitive life contracts, is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity. Decreases in the fair value of investments could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nEquity method adjustments on certain limited partnership investments as well as fair value accounting for equity securities may reduce profitability and/or cause volatility in the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company invests in limited partnership interests, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. This means that the Company's proportionate share of the changes in fair value of the underlying net asset values are reported in net investment income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a result, the amount of net investment income recognized from these investments can vary substantially from period to period. Recent equity and credit market volatility may reduce net investment income from these types of investments and negatively impact the results of operations. Changes in fair value from applying fair value accounting to equity securities that is reported in net investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations may cause volatility in the Company's results of operations.\nAn impairment of all or part of the Company's goodwill could adversely affect its results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company had $47.4 million of goodwill recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill was recorded when the Company was acquired in 1989 and when HMPCIC was acquired in 1994, in both instances reflecting the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired. In 2018, the goodwill balance was evaluated for impairment, as described in Item 8, Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, with no impairment charge resulting from such assessment. The evaluation of goodwill considers a number of factors including the impacts of a volatile financial market on earnings, discount rate assumptions, liquidity and the Company's market capitalization. If an evaluation of the Company's fair value or of the Company's reporting units' fair value indicates that all or a portion of the goodwill balance is impaired, the Company would be required to write-off the impaired portion. Such a write-off could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations in the period of the write-off; however, management does not anticipate a material effect on the Company's financial condition.\nRisks Related to Life and Retirement Segments\nA sustained period of low interest rates or interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect net interest margin derived from the difference between interest earned on investments and interest paid under fixed annuity and life insurance products with account values.\nSignificant changes in interest rates expose the Company to the risk of not earning the appropriate level of income or experiencing losses based on the differences between the interest earned on investments and the credited interest paid on outstanding fixed annuity and life insurance products with account values. Significant changes in interest rates may affect:\n\u2022\nthe ability to maintain appropriate interest rate spreads over the rates guaranteed in fixed annuity and life products;\n\u2022\nthe book yield of the investment portfolio; and\n\u2022\nthe net unrealized investment gains (losses) in the portfolio and the related after tax effect on shareholders' equity and total capital.\nBoth rising and declining interest rates can negatively affect the income derived from fixed annuity and life products' interest rate spreads. During periods of falling interest rates or a sustained period of low interest rates, investment earnings will be lower because new investments in fixed maturity securities likely will bear lower interest rates. The Company may not be able to fully offset the decline in investment earnings with lower crediting rates on fixed annuity products, particularly in a multi-year period of low interest rates. As of the time of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, new money rates remain at historically low levels. If interest rates do remain low over an extended period of time, it could pressure investment income by having to invest insurance cash flows and reinvest the cash flows from the investment portfolio in lower yielding securities.\nDuring periods of rising interest rates, there may be competitive pressure to increase the crediting rates on fixed annuity products. The Company may not, however, immediately have the ability to acquire investments with interest rates sufficient to offset an increase in crediting rates under fixed annuity products. Although the Company develops and maintains asset/liability management programs and procedures designed to reduce the volatility of investment income when interest rates are rising or falling, changes in interest rates can affect interest rate spreads.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect business in other ways. For example, a rapidly changing interest rate environment may result in less competitive crediting rates on certain fixed rate products which could make those products less attractive, leading to lower sales and/or increases in the level of life insurance and fixed annuity product surrenders and withdrawals. New business volume also could be negatively impacted by product or agent compensation changes which the Company might make to mitigate the income effect of spread compression. Interest rate fluctuations that impact future profits may also impact DAC amortization.\nThe Company's Life and Retirement operations participate in cash flow testing procedures imposed by statutory insurance regulations, the purpose of which is to ensure that reserves are adequate to meet the Company's obligations under a variety of interest rate scenarios. Variable annuity reserves are also calculated under a variety of interest rate and market rate scenarios. A continuation of the current low interest rate environment could cause the Company to increase statutory reserves as a result of cash flow testing or minimum requirements for variable annuities, which would reduce statutory surplus of the Life insurance subsidiaries and potentially limit the subsidiaries' ability to distribute cash to the holding company or write insurance business (as further described in a subsequent risk factor).\nThe Retirement business may be, and in the past has been, adversely affected by volatile or declining financial market conditions.\nConditions in the U.S. and international financial markets affect the sale and profitability of retirement products. In general, sales of fee-based products decrease when financial markets are declining or experiencing a higher than normal level of volatility over an extended period of time. Therefore, weak and/or volatile financial market performance may adversely affect sales of fee-based products to potential customers, may cause current customers to withdraw or reduce the amounts invested in fee-based products and may reduce the market value of existing customers' investments in fee-based products, in turn reducing the amount of fee-based product revenues generated. In addition, some variable annuity products offer guaranteed minimum death benefit features, which provide for a benefit if the contractholder dies and the contract value is less than a specified amount. A decline in the financial markets could cause the contract value to fall below this specified amount, increasing exposure to losses from variable annuity products featuring guaranteed minimum death benefits. Declining or volatile financial markets that impact future profits may also impact DAC amortization.\nThe Company may experience volatility in its results of operations and financial condition due to fair value accounting for derivative instruments.\nAll derivative instruments, including derivative instruments embedded in FIA and IUL products, are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in the Company's results of operations as follows:\n\u2022\nCall options purchased to fund the annual index credits on FIA and IUL products are carried at fair value. Fair value is based on the amount of cash expected to be received to settle the call options adjusted for the nonperformance risk of the counterparty. Changes in fair value of derivatives include the gains or losses recognized at expiration of the option term or upon early termination as well as changes in fair value for open positions.\n\u2022\nFIA contractual obligations for future annual index credits are accounted for as a \"series of embedded derivatives\" over the expected lives of the applicable contracts. Increases or decreases in the fair value of embedded derivatives generally correspond to increases or decreases in equity market performance and changes in interest rates used to discount the excess of the projected policy contract values over the projected minimum guaranteed contract values.\n\u2022\nThe IUL contractual obligations for future index credits are set equal to the fair value of outstanding 12 month derivatives held in support of the applicable contracts.\nIn future periods, the application of fair value accounting for derivatives and embedded derivatives to FIA and IUL business may cause volatility in the Company's results of operations.\nDeviations from assumptions regarding future market appreciation, interest spreads, business persistency, mortality and morbidity used in calculating life and annuity reserves and DAC amortization could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe processes of calculating reserves and DAC amortization for the life and annuity businesses involve the use of a number of assumptions, including those related to market appreciation (the rate of growth in market value of the underlying variable annuity sub-accounts due to price appreciation), interest spreads (the interest rates expected to be received on investments less the rate of interest credited to contractholders), business persistency (how long a contract stays with the Company), mortality (the relative incidence of death over a given period of time) and morbidity (the relative incidence of disability resulting from disease or physical impairment). The Company periodically reviews the adequacy of these reserves and DAC recoverability on an aggregate basis and, if future experience is estimated to differ significantly from previous assumptions, adjustments to reserves and DAC amortization may be required which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nA reduction or elimination of the tax advantages of retirement and life products and/or a change in the tax benefits of various government-authorized retirement programs, such as 403(b) products and individual retirement accounts (IRAs), could make the Company's products less attractive to clients and adversely affect its results of operations.\nA significant part of the Company's retirement business involves fixed and variable 403(b) tax-qualified products, which are purchased voluntarily by individuals employed by public school systems or other tax-exempt organizations. The Company's financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations that affect the relative tax and other advantages of its life and retirement products to clients or the tax benefits of programs utilized by its customers. As a result of persisting economic conditions, revenue challenges exist at federal, state and local government levels. These challenges could increase the risk of future adverse impacts on current tax-advantaged products or result in notable reforms to educator pension programs. Also, see Item 1, Regulation of this report.\nCurrent federal income tax laws generally permit the tax-deferred accumulation of earnings on the premiums paid by the holders of retirement and life insurance products. Taxes, if any, are generally payable on income attributable to a distribution under the contract for the year in which the distribution is made. From time to time, Congress has considered legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of such deferral of taxation on the accretion of value within life insurance and non-qualified annuity contracts. Enactment of this legislation, or other tax reform efforts, including a simplified \"flat tax\" income structure with an exemption from taxation for investment income, could result in fewer sales of life insurance and retirement products.\nRisks Related to Property and Casualty\nCatastrophic events, as well as significant weather events not designated as catastrophes, can have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nUnderwriting results of property and casualty insurers are subject to weather and other conditions prevailing in an accident year. While one year may be relatively free of major weather or other disasters - not all of which are designated by the insurance industry as a catastrophe, another year may have numerous such events causing results for such a year to be materially worse than for previous years.\nThe Company's Property and Casualty insurance subsidiaries have experienced, and the Company anticipates that in the future they will continue to experience, catastrophe losses. A catastrophic event, a series of multiple catastrophic events or a series of non-catastrophe severe weather events could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the insurance subsidiaries.\nVarious events can cause catastrophes, including hurricanes, windstorms, hail, severe winter weather, wildfires, earthquakes, explosions and terrorism. The frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Although catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of property and casualty lines, most of the catastrophe-related claims of the Company's insurance subsidiaries are related to property coverages. The Company's ability to provide accurate estimates of ultimate catastrophe costs is based on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe proximity of the catastrophe occurrence date to the date of the Company's estimate;\n\u2022\npotential inflation of property repair costs in the affected area;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of multiple catastrophes in a geographic area over a relatively short period of time; and\n\u2022\nthe outcome of litigation which may be filed against the Company by policyholders, state attorneys general and other parties relative to loss coverage disputes and loss settlement payments.\nBased on 2018 direct premiums earned, 57.8% of the total annual premiums for the Company's Property and Casualty business were for policies issued in the ten largest states in which the insurance subsidiaries write property and casualty coverage. Included in this top ten group are certain states which are considered to be more prone to catastrophe occurrences: California, North Carolina, Texas, South Carolina, Florida, Louisiana and Colorado.\nAs an ongoing practice, the Company manages its exposure to catastrophes, as well as its exposure to non-catastrophe weather and other property loss risks. Reductions in Property and Casualty business written in catastrophe-prone areas may have a negative impact on near-term business growth and results of operations.\nThe Company's insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses through their underwriting strategies and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. Nevertheless, reinsurance may prove inadequate under certain circumstances.\nThe Company's Property and Casualty loss reserves may not be adequate.\nThe Company's Property and Casualty insurance subsidiaries maintain loss reserves to provide for their estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each reporting date. If these loss reserves prove inadequate, a loss is recognized and measured by the amount of the shortfall and, as a result, the financial condition and results of operations of the insurance subsidiaries may be adversely affected, potentially affecting their ability to distribute cash to the Company.\nReserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Reserves represent estimates, generally involving actuarial projections at a given time, of what the insurance subsidiaries expect the ultimate settlement and adjustment of claims will cost, net of salvage and subrogation. Estimates are based on assessments of known facts and circumstances, assumptions related to the ultimate cost to settle such claims, estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency, changing judicial theories of liability, and other factors. These variables are affected by both internal and external events, including changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation, unpredictability of court decisions, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability, risks inherent in major litigation and legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Significant reporting lags may exist between the occurrence\nof an insured event and the time it is actually reported. The Company's insurance subsidiaries adjust their reserve estimates regularly as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, the Company cannot be certain that the ultimate liability will not exceed amounts reserved, with a resulting adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations.\nChanging climate conditions may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nMany scientists indicate that the world's overall climate is getting warmer. Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency and/or severity of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of the Company's catastrophe reinsurance coverage, and the Company's results of operations. If an increase in weather events and/or wildfires were to occur, in addition to the attendant increase in claim costs, which could adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition, concentrations of insurance risk could impact the Company's ability to make property insurance available to customers. This could adversely impact the volume of business and the Company's results of operations or cash flows.\nStrategic Risks and Operational Risks\nBusiness or asset acquisitions may expose the Company to certain risks.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, compliance and tax risks. The completion of any business acquisition is subject to certain risks, including those relating to the receipt of required regulatory approvals, the terms and conditions of regulatory approvals, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of a transaction and the risk that the parties may not be willing or able to satisfy the conditions to a transaction. As a result, there can be no assurance that any business acquisition will be completed as contemplated, or at all, or regarding the expected timing of the completion of the acquisition. Once acquisitions are complete, there can be no assurance that the Company will realize the anticipated economic, strategic or other benefits of any transaction. For example, the integration of businesses acquired may not be as successful as anticipated or there may be undisclosed risks present in such businesses. Difficulties integrating an acquired business may result in the acquired business performing differently than expected (including through the loss of customers) or in failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by acquisitions resulting from the diversion of management\u2019s attention.\nThe personal lines insurance and retirement markets are highly competitive and the Company's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by competitive forces.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive environment and competes with numerous insurance companies, as well as mutual fund families, independent agent companies and financial planners. In some instances and geographic locations, competitors have specifically targeted the educator marketplace with specialized products and programs. The Company competes in its target market with a number of national providers of personal automobile and property insurance and life insurance and retirement products.\nThe insurance industry consists of a large number of insurance companies, some of which have substantially greater financial resources, more diversified product lines, more sophisticated product pricing, greater economies of scale and/or lower-cost marketing approaches compared to the Company. In the Company's target market, it believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of property and casualty insurance products are overall service, worksite sales and service, price, and name recognition. The Company believes that for its market, the principal competitive factors in the sale of retirement products and life insurance are worksite sales and service, product features, perceived stability of the insurer, price, overall service and name recognition. And, the Company believes that its focus on the educator market niche, as well as the knowledge obtained regarding this niche throughout the Company's history, contribute to its ability to effectively and profitably serve this market.\nParticularly in the Property and Casualty business, the Company's insurance subsidiaries have experienced pricing and profitability cycles. During these periods of intense competition, they may be unable to increase policyholders and revenues without adversely impacting profit margins. With respect to these cycles, the factors having the greatest impact include significant and/or rapid changes in loss costs, including changes in loss frequency and/or severity; prior approval and restrictions in certain states for price increases; intense price competition; less restrictive underwriting standards; aggressive marketing; and increased advertising, which have resulted in higher industry-wide combined loss and expense ratios. During the current cycle, and potentially beyond, competition from direct writers and large, mass market carriers has been particularly aggressive, evidenced in part by their significant national advertising expenditures. In addition, advancements in vehicle technology and safety features, such as accident prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles - once widely available and utilized, as well as expanded availability of usage-based insurance could materially alter the way that automobile insurance is marketed, priced and underwritten. The inability of the Company's insurance subsidiaries to effectively anticipate the impact of these issues on its business and compete successfully in the property and casualty business could adversely affect the subsidiaries' financial condition and results of operations and the resulting ability to distribute cash to the Company.\nIn the Retirement business, the current IRS Section 403(b) regulations make the 403(b) market similar to the 401(k) market. These regulations have reduced and could continue to reduce the number of competitors in this market as the 403(b) market has become more attractive to some of the larger companies experienced in 401(k) plans, including both insurance and mutual fund companies, that had not previously been active competitors in this business. While not yet widespread, there has been continued pressure in some states to adopt state-sponsored or mandated 403(b) plans with single- or limited-provider options; this pressure has come from competitor lobbying efforts and state legislature pension reform initiatives. The inability of the Company's insurance subsidiaries to compete successfully in these markets could adversely affect the subsidiaries' financial condition and results of operations and the resulting ability to distribute cash to the Company.\nIf the Company is not able to effectively develop and expand its marketing operations, including agents and other points of distribution, its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company's agencies are owned primarily by non-employee, independent contractor Exclusive Distributors with most agencies operating in outside offices with licensed producers. The economic viability of each agency is directly dependent on the productivity of the agency and the success at penetrating, serving and cross-selling the Company's educator market.\nThe Company's success in marketing and selling its products is largely dependent upon the efforts of its agent sales force and the success of their agency operations. As the Company expands its business, it may need to expand the number of agencies marketing its products. If the Company is unable to appoint additional agents, fail to retain high-producing agents, unable to maintain the productivity of those agency operations or unable to maintain market penetration in existing territories, sales of the Company's products likely would decline and the Company's financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf the Company is not able to maintain and secure (1) access to educators and (2) endorsements and other relationships with the educational community, its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company's ability to successfully increase new business in the educator market is largely dependent on its ability to effectively access educators either in their school buildings or through other approaches. While this is especially true for the sale of 403(b) tax-qualified retirement products via payroll deduction, any significant decrease in access, either through fewer payroll slots, increased security measures, impacts of state or federal level pension reform initiatives, requirements of national and state Do Not Call registries, or for other reasons could adversely affect the sale of all lines of business and require the Company to change its traditional approach to worksite marketing and promotion, as well as contact with potential customers. With the current IRS regulations regarding Section 403(b) arrangements, including retirement products, the Company's ability to maintain and increase its share of the 403(b) market, and the access it gives for other product lines, will depend on its ability to successfully compete in this market. Some school districts and benefit consultants have placed emphasis on the relative financial strength ratings of competing companies, as well as low cost product and distribution approaches, which may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to other more highly-rated insurance companies.\nThe Company's ability to maintain and obtain product and corporate endorsements from, and/or marketing agreements with, local, state and national education-related associations is important to its marketing strategy. In addition to teacher organizations, the Company has established relationships with various other educator, principal, school administrator and school business official groups. These contacts and endorsements help to establish the Company's brand name and presence in the educational community and to enhance access to educators.\nEconomic and other factors affecting the Company's niche market could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nHorace Mann's strategic objective is to become the company of choice in meeting the insurance and financial services needs of the educational community. With K-12 teachers, administrators, and support personnel representing the majority of its business, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company's subsidiaries could be more prone than many of its competitors to the effects of economic forces and other issues affecting the educator market including, but not limited to, federal, state and local budget deficits and cut-backs and adverse changes in state and local tax revenues.\nWhile the U.S. financial markets and certain sectors of the economy have shown improvement over recent years, federal and state revenue shortages continue to pressure the budgets of many school districts. Teacher layoffs and early retirements have taken place and it is possible that additional reductions could occur. Similar to others in the insurance industry, the Company has experienced periods with pressure on new business sales levels. However, despite the economic headwinds, as of the time of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K, the Company's retention of annuity accumulated values remains strong. However, there can be no assurance that these business factors will remain favorable.\nIndividual states may impose additional cybersecurity regulations, increasing the complexity of compliance.\nIn the absence of overarching federal law, individual states are adopting their own privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations. Indeed, most states have passed some form of privacy and/or cybersecurity laws or regulations, including New York, South Carolina, and California. For example, the New York State Department of Financial Services adopted regulation providing minimum standards for an organization's cybersecurity program and requiring an annual certification confirming compliance. Also, in May 2018, South Carolina passed a cybersecurity bill requiring, among other things, any insurance entity operating in the state to establish and implement a cybersecurity program protecting their business and their customers from a data breach, to investigate data breaches and notify regulators of a cybersecurity event. In July 2018, California passed a broad-based privacy law which provides consumers with the following new rights: (1) the right to request information about personal information a company has collected about them; (2) the right to require deletion of their personal information; (3) the right to request disclosures of information about how their personal information is collected and shared; and (4) the right to instruct a company not to share their personal information. In the absence of overarching federal laws and regulations on data privacy and cybersecurity, it is anticipated that individual states will enact new or amended state laws and regulations governing data privacy and cybersecurity.\nData security breaches or denial of service on the Company's websites could have an adverse impact on its business and reputation.\nUnauthorized access to and unintentional dissemination of the Company's confidential, highly-sensitive customer, employee or Company data or other breaches of data security in the Company's facilities, networks or databases, or those of its agents or third-party vendors - including information technology and software vendors, could result in loss or theft of assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption that may expose the Company to liability and/or regulatory action and may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s customers, employees, investors, reputation and business. In addition, any compromise of the security of Company data or prolonged denial of service on the Company's websites could harm its business and reputation. Additionally, the Company recognizes the increased external threats of data breaches in the marketplace resulting in non-public data of customers becoming increasingly available in the public domain. The Company has designed, implemented and routinely tested industry-compliant procedures for protection of confidential information and sensitive corporate data, including rapid response procedures to help contain or prevent data loss if a breach were to occur and the evaluation of its customer identification authentication programs. The Company has also implemented multiple technical security protections and contractual obligations regarding security breaches for its agents and third-party vendors. Even with these efforts, there can be no assurance that security breaches or service disruptions will be prevented.\nSuccessful execution of the Company's business growth strategy is dependent on effective implementation of new or enhanced technology systems and applications.\nThe Company's ability to effectively execute its business growth strategy and leverage potential economies of scale is dependent on its ability to provide the requisite technology components for that strategy. While the Company has effectively upgraded its infrastructure technologies with improvements in its data center, a new communications platform and enhancements to its disaster recovery capabilities,\nits ability to replace or supplement dated, monolithic legacy business systems - such as the Company's Life, Retirement and Property and Casualty policy administrative systems - with more flexible, maintainable, and customer accessible solutions will be necessary to achieve its plans. The inherent difficulty in replacing and/or modernizing these older technologies, coupled with the Company's limited experience in these endeavors, presents an increased risk to delivering these technology solutions in a cost effective and timely manner. The Company's scale will require it to develop innovative solutions to address these challenges, including consideration of \"software as a service\" arrangements and other third-party based information technology capabilities. More modern approaches to software development and utilization of third-party vendors can augment the Company's internal capacity for these implementations, but may not adequately reduce the operational risks of timely and cost effective delivery.\nLoss of key vendor relationships could affect the Company's operations.\nThe Company increasingly relies on services and products provided by a number of vendors in the U.S. and abroad. These include, for example, vendors of computer hardware and software, including on-demand software, and vendors of services such as investment management advisement, information technology services - such as those associated with the Life, Retirement and Property and Casualty policy administrative systems - and delivery services for customer policy-level communications. In the event that one or more of the Company's vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, the Company may suffer operational difficulties and financial losses.\nFinancial Strength, Credit and Counterparty Risks\nLosses due to defaults by others could reduce the Company's profitability or negatively affect the value of its investments.\nThird-party debtors may not pay or perform their obligations. These parties may include the issuers whose securities the Company holds, customers, reinsurers, borrowers under mortgage loans, trading counterparties, derivative counterparties, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries. These parties may default on their obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate values, operational failure or other reasons.\nDuring or following an economic downturn, the Company's municipal bond portfolio could be subject to a higher risk of default or impairment due to declining municipal tax bases and revenue. States are currently barred from seeking protection in federal bankruptcy court. However, federal legislation could possibly be enacted to allow states to declare bankruptcy in connection with deficit reductions or mounting unfunded pension liabilities, which could adversely impact the value of the Company's investment portfolio.\nThe default of a major market participant could disrupt the securities markets or clearance and settlement systems in the U.S. or abroad. A failure of a major market participant could cause some clearance and settlement systems to assess members of that system, including the Company's broker-dealer and Registered Investment Adviser regulatory entities, or could lead to a chain of defaults that could adversely affect the Company. A default of a major market participant could disrupt various markets, which could in turn cause market declines or volatility and negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nUncollectible reinsurance, as well as reinsurance availability and pricing, can have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business volume and profitability.\nReinsurance is a contract by which one insurer, called a reinsurer, agrees to cover a portion of the losses incurred by a second insurer in the event a claim is made under a policy issued by the second insurer. The Company's insurance subsidiaries obtain reinsurance to help manage their exposure to property, casualty and life insurance risks. Although a reinsurer is liable to the Company's insurance subsidiaries according to the terms of its reinsurance policy, the insurance subsidiaries remain primarily liable as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured. As a result, reinsurance does not eliminate the obligation of the insurance subsidiaries to pay all claims, and each insurance subsidiary is subject to the risk that one or more of its reinsurers will be unable or unwilling to honor its obligations.\nAlthough the Company limits participation in its reinsurance programs to reinsurers with high financial strength ratings and also limit the amount of coverage from each reinsurer, the Company's insurance subsidiaries cannot guarantee that their reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion, if at all. Reinsurers may become financially unsound by the time that they are called upon to pay amounts due, which may not occur for many years.\nAdditionally, the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions beyond the Company's control. For example, significant losses from hurricanes or terrorist attacks, an increase in capital requirements, or a future lapse of the provisions of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act could have a significant adverse impact on the reinsurance market.\nIf one of the Company's insurance subsidiaries is unable to obtain adequate reinsurance at reasonable rates, that insurance subsidiary would have to increase its risk exposure and/or reduce the level of its underwriting commitments, which could have a material adverse effect upon the business volume and profitability of the subsidiary. Alternately, the insurance subsidiary could elect to pay the higher than reasonable rates for reinsurance coverage, which could have a material adverse effect upon its profitability until policy premium rates could be raised, in some cases subject to approval by state regulators, to incorporate this additional cost.\nAny downgrade in or adverse change in outlook for the Company's claims-paying ratings, financial strength ratings or credit ratings could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims-paying ratings and financial strength ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. In the evolving 403(b) retirement market, school districts and benefit consultants have placed an emphasis on the relative financial strength ratings of competing companies. Each rating agency reviews its ratings periodically and from time to time may modify its rating criteria including, among other factors, its expectations regarding capital adequacy, profitability and revenue growth. A downgrade in the ratings or adverse change in the ratings outlook of any of the Company's insurance subsidiaries by a major rating agency could result in substantial loss of business for that subsidiary if school districts, policyholders or independent agents move their business to other companies having higher claims-paying ratings and financial strength ratings than the Company has. This loss of business could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of that subsidiary.\nA downgrade of the Company's debt rating also could adversely impact its cost and flexibility of borrowing which could have an adverse impact on its liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nReduction of the statutory surplus of the Company's insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect their ability to write insurance business.\nInsurance companies write business based, in part, upon guidelines including capital ratios considered by the NAIC and various rating agencies. Some of these ratios include risk-based capital ratios for both property and casualty insurance companies and life insurance companies, as well as a ratio of premiums to surplus for property and casualty insurance companies. Risk-based capital ratios measure an insurer's capital adequacy and consider various risks such as underwriting, investment, credit, asset concentration and interest rate. If the Company's insurance subsidiaries cannot maintain profitability in the future or if significant investment valuation losses are incurred, they may be required to draw on their surplus, thereby reducing capital adequacy, in order to pay dividends to the Company to enable it to meet its financial obligations. As their surplus is reduced by the payment of dividends, continuing losses or both, the Company's insurance subsidiaries' ability to write business and maintain acceptable financial strength ratings could also be reduced. This could have a material adverse effect upon the business volume and profitability of the insurance subsidiaries.\nAn inability to access Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) funding could adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\nAny changes in requirements to retain membership in the FHLB, or changes in regulation, could impact the Company's eligibility for continued FHLB membership or its FHLB funding capacity. Any event that adversely affects amounts received from FHLB could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. See Item 7, Financing Activities for more information about FHLB activities.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nThe insurance industry is highly regulated.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which it does business. Each jurisdiction has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. Furthermore, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. Regulation generally is designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to stockholders and non-policyholder creditors. Such regulations, among other things, impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments the Company's subsidiaries may hold. Certain states also regulate the rates insurers may charge for certain property and casualty products. Legislation and voter initiatives have expanded, in some instances, the states' regulation of rates and have increased data reporting requirements. Consumer-related pressures to roll back rates, even if not enacted by legislation or upheld upon judicial appeal, may affect the Company's ability to obtain timely rate increases or operate at desired levels of profitability. Changes in insurance regulations, including those affecting the ability of the Company's insurance subsidiaries to distribute cash to the Company and those affecting the ability of its insurance subsidiaries to write profitable property and casualty insurance policies in one or more states, may adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the insurance subsidiaries. In addition, consumer privacy requirements may increase the Company's cost of processing business. The Company's ability to comply with laws and regulations, at a reasonable cost, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to its success.\nRegulation that could adversely affect the Company's insurance subsidiaries also includes statutory surplus and risk-based capital requirements. Maintaining appropriate levels of surplus, as measured by statutory accounting principles, is considered important by state insurance regulatory authorities and the\nprivate agencies that rate insurers' claims-paying abilities and financial strength. The failure of an insurance subsidiary to maintain levels of statutory surplus that are sufficient for the amount of its insurance written could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, action by state regulatory authorities or a downgrade by rating agencies.\nSimilarly, the NAIC has adopted a system of assessing minimum capital adequacy that is applicable to the Company's insurance subsidiaries. This system, known as risk-based capital, is used to identify companies that may merit further regulatory action by analyzing the adequacy of the insurer's surplus in relation to statutory requirements.\nBecause state legislatures remain concerned about the availability and affordability of property and casualty insurance and the protection of policyholders, the Company's insurance subsidiaries expect that they will continue to face efforts by those legislatures to expand regulations to address these concerns. Resulting new legislation could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the insurance subsidiaries.\nIn the event of insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of any of the Company's insurance subsidiaries, its creditors and stockholders would have no right to proceed against any such insurance subsidiary or cause the liquidation or bankruptcy of any such insurance subsidiary under federal or state bankruptcy laws. The insurance laws of the domiciliary state would govern such proceedings and the relevant insurance commissioner would act as liquidator or rehabilitator for the insurance subsidiary. Creditors and policyholders of any such insurance subsidiary would be entitled to full payment from the assets of the insurance subsidiary before the Company, as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution.\nThe financial position of the Company's insurance subsidiaries also may be affected by court decisions that expand insurance coverage beyond the intention of the insurer at the time it originally issued an insurance policy.\nDodd-Frank created the FIO within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The FIO studies the current insurance regulatory system and is charged with monitoring and providing specific reports on various aspects of the insurance industry. However, the FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance. The FIO has suggested an expanded federal role in some circumstances. Management will continue to monitor developments under Dodd-Frank, as various aspects of it continue to be addressed by governmental bodies. Additional regulations could adversely affect the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, insurers of similar size and/or the insurance industry as a whole.\nRegulatory initiatives, including the enactment Dodd-Frank, could adversely impact liquidity and volatility of financial markets in which the Company participates.\nIn response to the credit and financial crisis, U.S. and overseas governmental and regulatory authorities are considering or implementing enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or stabilize the institutions under their supervision. Such measures are leading to stricter regulation of financial institutions. Changes from Dodd-Frank and other U.S. and overseas governmental initiatives have created uncertainty and could continue to adversely impact liquidity and increase volatility of the financial markets in which the Company participates and, in turn, negatively affect its financial condition or results of operations. The executive branch has requested a review of financial regulations including Dodd-Frank, which may eliminate or mitigate this risk.\nFuture regulatory and legislative activity, including standards of care proposed by the SEC and related state activity, could have an adverse material effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe regulatory standards of care owed by financial intermediaries to retail and institutional clients are in a state of flux. In 2016, the Department of Labor (DOL) adopted a final regulation defining who would be a \"fiduciary\" of an employee benefit plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) as a result of giving investment advice to a plan or its participants or beneficiaries (the Fiduciary Rule). The DOL also adopted prohibited transaction exemptions, including the \"Best Interest Contract\" (BIC Exemption), designed to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure investment advice fiduciaries provide advice in their clients' best interest. The Fiduciary Rule replaced a less restrictive \"Five Part Test\" regulating the scope of persons who fit the definition of an investment advice fiduciary under ERISA and the Code, resulting in an expansion of types of activities considered to be investment advice. However, on June 21, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit vacated the Fiduciary Rule and the related prohibited transaction exemptions, including the BIC Exemption.\nThe regulatory environment continued to evolve in 2018 with the SEC's introduction of proposed rules governing the fiduciary duty and standard of conduct applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisers that provide retail investment advice. Among other things, the proposed rules establish a broker-dealer best interest standard of conduct when recommending securities transactions to retail customers, require broker-dealers and investment advisers to summarize their relationship to retail investors, and require investment advisers to adhere to a new SEC standard of conduct interpretation.\nThere also continues to be regulatory and legislative activity at the state level. The NAIC proposed amendments to its Suitability in Annuity Transactions model regulation that would require an insurance producer to act in the interests of the consumer, without placing the producer\u2019s or the insurer\u2019s financial interest ahead of the consumer\u2019s interest when recommending an annuity. For example, the New York Department of Financial Services issued its final version of its \"Suitability and Best Interest in Life Insurance and Annuity Transactions\" regulation, which provides for a \"best interest\" standard of care for all sales of life insurance and annuity products. Also, Nevada amended its definition of \"financial planner\" in 2017 to include broker-dealers, sales representatives and investment advisers and their respective representatives, resulting in such persons owing a fiduciary duty to their clients. In 2019, the Nevada Securities Division proposed regulations that, if adopted, could have a significant impact on broker-dealers, sales representatives and investment advisers and their client relationships. Regulatory and legislative activity concerning financial intermediaries continues to develop in other states, as well.\nIndividually and collectively, these federal and state regulatory and legislative activities have the potential to adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation may harm the Company's financial strength or reduce its profitability.\nCompanies in the insurance industry have been subject to substantial litigation resulting from claims, disputes and other matters. Most recently, they have faced expensive claims, including class action lawsuits, alleging, among other things, improper sales practices and improper claims settlement procedures. Negotiated settlements of certain such actions have had a material adverse effect on many insurance companies. The resolution of similar future claims against any of the Company's insurance subsidiaries, including the potential adverse effect on its reputation and charges against the earnings of its insurance subsidiaries as a result of legal defense costs, a settlement agreement or an adverse finding or findings against its insurance subsidiaries in such a claim, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the insurance subsidiaries.", "PERMNO": 77120, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "HMN"}
