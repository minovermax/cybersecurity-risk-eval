{"cik": "1672326", "company": "Yuma Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially affect our business. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in this report under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInadequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business operations.\nWe have significant outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility. As of December 31, 2018, we had fully drawn the $34.0 million available under our credit facility and were in default under the credit agreement. In addition, we have experienced significant declines in our production and have limited cash flow to fund the ongoing operations of our business. Due to this limited liquidity and decreased cash flow, we may not be able to maintain production, which could lead to continued deterioration in our financial condition.\nOur ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness and to satisfy our other obligations will depend upon our ability to consummate asset sales and/or a merger transaction at values consistent with our reported reserve values, which is beyond our control. If a transaction closes, our future operating performance and financial condition will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which we also cannot control. In any event, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or that future capital will be available to us under a new credit facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. In the absence of adequate cash from operations and other available capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems, and we might be required to seek additional debt or equity financing or to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, or we may fail to continue as a going concern. We cannot assure you that we would be able to raise capital through debt or equity financings on terms acceptable to us or at all, or that we could consummate dispositions of assets or operations for fair market value, in a timely manner or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any financings or dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service or other obligations then due.\nOur auditors and management have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs disclosed in the financial statements, we incurred net losses attributable to common shareholders of $17.1 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018, our total current liabilities of $44.2 million exceed our total current assets of $7.2 million. Additionally, we are in violation of our debt covenants, have stopped paying interest under our credit facility, have experienced recent production declines, have extremely limited liquidity, and have suffered recurring losses from operations. We believe these circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the sale of substantially all of our assets and/or a merger transaction. If we are not able to generate the funds needed to cover our ongoing expenses, then we may be forced to cease operations or seek bankruptcy protection, in which event our stockholders could lose their entire investment.\nWe are in breach of multiple covenants under our credit agreement and we are relying on our lenders\u2019 forbearance from exercising their rights under the credit agreement, which include the right to foreclose upon our assets.\nWe remain in breach of multiple covenants under our credit agreement with our lenders. There is no assurance that the lenders will not declare a default and seek immediate repayment of the entire debt borrowed under the credit facility because of these breaches.\nWe are subject to compliance under the NYSE American LLC continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide, related to securities selling price.\nOn January 4, 2019, we received a letter from NYSE American stating that our common stock has been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time and, pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide, our continued listing is predicated on it effecting a reverse stock split of our common stock or otherwise demonstrating sustained price improvement within a reasonable period of time, which NYSE American had determined to be no later than July 4, 2019, and subject to our compliance with other continued listing requirements and the trading price remaining above a required $0.06 minimum per share.\nIf we are not able to access additional capital in significant amounts, we may not be able to continue to develop our current prospects and properties, or we may forfeit our interest in certain prospects and we may not be able to continue to operate our business.\nWe need significant capital to continue to operate our properties and continue operations. In the near term, we intend to finance our capital expenditures with cash flow from operations, and possibly the future issuance of debt and/or equity securities. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including, among others:\n\u25cf\nour estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf\nthe amount of oil and natural gas we produce from existing wells;\n\u25cf\nthe prices at which we sell our production;\n\u25cf\nthe costs of developing and producing our oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u25cf\nour borrowing base and willingness of banks to lend to us; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to access the equity and debt capital markets.\nOur operations and other capital resources may not provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain future levels of capital expenditures. Further, our actual capital expenditures in 2019 could exceed our capital expenditure budget. In the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of capital we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include refinancing existing debt, joint venture partnerships, production payment financings, sales of non-core property assets, or offerings of debt or equity securities. We may not be able to obtain any form of financing on terms favorable, or at all.\nIf we are unable to fund our capital requirements, we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, or we may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations. In addition, a delay in or the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and related cost savings. The occurrence of such events may prevent us from continuing to operate our business and our common stock and preferred stock may not have any value.\nOur business is highly competitive.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive in many respects, including identification of attractive oil and natural gas properties for acquisition, drilling and development, securing financing for such activities and obtaining the necessary equipment and personnel to conduct such operations and activities. In seeking suitable opportunities, we compete with a number of other companies, including large oil and natural gas companies and other independent operators with greater financial resources, larger numbers of personnel and facilities, and, in some cases, with more expertise. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with these entities.\nOur short-term liquidity is severely constrained, and could severely impact our cash flow and our development of our properties.\nCurrently, our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the sale of assets, and potential proceeds from capital market transactions, including the sale of debt and equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had outstanding borrowing of $34.0 million under our credit facility and our total borrowing base was $34.0 million. Since significant amounts of capital are required for companies to participate in the business of exploration for and development of oil and natural gas resources, we are dependent on improving our cash flow and revenue, as well as receipt of additional working capital, to fund continued development and implementation of our business plan. Adverse developments in our business or general economic conditions may require us to raise additional financing at prices or on terms that are disadvantageous to existing stockholders. We may not be able to obtain additional capital at all and may be forced to curtail or cease our operations. We will continue to rely on equity or debt financing and the sale of working interests to finance operations until such time, if ever, that we generate sustained positive cash flow. The inability to obtain necessary financing will likely adversely impact our ability to develop our properties and to expand our business operations.\nOur credit facility has substantial restrictions and financial covenants and our ability to regain compliance with those restrictions and covenants is highly unlikely. Our lenders can unilaterally reduce our borrowing availability based on anticipated commodity prices.\nThe terms of our Credit Agreement require us to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios, which we were not in compliance with as of December 31, 2018. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is highly doubtful and will be affected by the levels of cash flows from operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under the credit facility or other debt agreements, as well as our inability to make interest payments, has resulted in a default under those agreements, which has caused all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable. Reductions in our borrowing base under our credit facility could also arise from several factors, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nlower commodity prices or production;\n\u25cf\nincreased leverage ratios;\n\u25cf\ninability to drill or unfavorable drilling results;\n\u25cf\nchanges in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid reserves due to engineering updates, or changes in engineering applications;\n\u25cf\nincreased operating and/or capital costs;\n\u25cf\nthe lenders\u2019 inability to agree to an adequate borrowing base; or\n\u25cf\nadverse changes in the lenders\u2019 practices (including required regulatory changes) regarding estimation of reserves.\nThe credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount, determined by the lenders in their sole discretion based upon projected revenues from the properties securing their loan. For example, our lenders have set our current borrowing base at $34.0 million. Prices of crude oil below $50.00 per Bbl are likely to have an adverse effect on our borrowing base. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the credit facility. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately, or we must pledge other oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral. We do not currently have any substantial unpledged properties, and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments required under the credit facility. Any inability to borrow additional funds under our credit facility could adversely affect our operations and our financial results, and possibly force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe are currently unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, resulting in a default under the terms of these agreements, which could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that we have borrowed and would impact our ability to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and satisfy our other obligations.\nWe are in default under the agreements governing our indebtedness and the remedies sought by the holders of any such indebtedness, could make us unable to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and satisfy our other obligations. Since we are in default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to our defaults under the debt agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase although the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness and for other purposes would decrease.\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are volatile. Their prices at times since 2014 have adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments. Volatile and lower prices may also negatively impact our stock price.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production heavily influence our revenues, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. These hydrocarbons are commodities, and therefore, their prices may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the market for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids has been volatile. For example, during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018, the West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) spot price for oil declined from a high of $107.95 per Bbl in June 2014 to $26.19 per Bbl in February 2016. The Henry Hub spot price for natural gas has declined from a high of $8.15 per MMBtu in February 2014 to a low of $1.49 per MMBtu in March 2016. During 2018, WTI spot prices ranged from $44.48 to $77.41 per Bbl and the Henry Hub spot price of natural gas ranged from $2.49 to $6.24 per MMBtu. Likewise, natural gas liquids, which are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline, each of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics, have experienced significant declines in realized prices since the fall of 2014. The prices we receive for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce and our production levels depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf\nworldwide and regional economic and financial conditions impacting global and regional supply and demand;\n\u25cf\nthe level of global exploration, development and production;\n\u25cf\nthe level of global supplies, in particular due to supply growth from the United States;\n\u25cf\nthe price and quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs imports to and exports from the U.S.;\n\u25cf\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids producing countries and regions, including the current conflicts in the Middle East, as well as conditions in South America, Africa and Eastern Europe;\n\u25cf\nactions of the OPEC and state-controlled oil companies relating to production and price controls;\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which U.S. shale producers become swing producers adding or subtracting to the world supply totals;\n\u25cf\nfuture regulations prohibiting or restricting our ability to apply hydraulic fracturing to our wells;\n\u25cf\ncurrent and future regulations regarding well spacing;\n\u25cf\nprevailing prices and pricing differentials on local oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids price indices in the areas in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nlocalized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation, gathering and processing availability;\n\u25cf\nweather conditions;\n\u25cf\ntechnological advances affecting fuel economy, energy supply and energy consumption;\n\u25cf\nthe effect of energy conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u25cf\ndomestic, local and foreign governmental regulation and taxes.\nLower oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices have and may continue to reduce our cash flows and borrowing capacity. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our hydrocarbon reserves as existing reserves are depleted. A decrease in prices could render development projects and producing properties uneconomic, potentially resulting in a loss of mineral leases. Low commodity prices have, at times, caused significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and may cause us to make further downward adjustments in the future. Furthermore, our borrowing capacity could be significantly affected by decreased prices. A sustained decline in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices could adversely impact our borrowing base in future borrowing base redeterminations, which could trigger repayment obligations under the Credit Agreement to the extent our outstanding borrowings exceed the redetermined borrowing base and could otherwise materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. In addition, lower oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids gas prices may cause a decline in the market price of our shares. As of the date of this report, we do not have any commodity derivative contracts that hedge our oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids price risk.\nAs a result of low prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, we have taken and may be required to take significant future write-downs of the financial carrying values of our properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on prevailing commodity prices and specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we have been required to, and may be required to significantly write-down the financial carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties, which constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are recorded.\nA write-down could occur when oil and natural gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves, if operating costs or development costs increase over prior estimates, or if our drilling and workover program is unsuccessful.\nThe capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties subject to amortization, net of accumulated DD&A and related deferred taxes, are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus unproved properties not subject to amortization. If the capitalized cost of these proved properties subject to amortization exceeds these estimated future net cash flows, we would be required to record impairment charges to reduce the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties. These types of charges will reduce our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity and could adversely affect our stock price. Unproved properties not subject to amortization are evaluated quarterly, and this review may result in these properties being moved into our oil and gas properties subject to amortization.\nWe periodically assess our properties for impairment based on future estimates of proved and non-proved reserves, oil and natural gas prices, production rates and operating, development and reclamation costs based on operating budget forecasts. Once incurred, an impairment charge cannot be reversed at a later date even if price increases of oil and/or natural gas occur and in the event of increases in the quantity of our estimated proved reserves.\nIf oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices fall below current levels for an extended period of time and all other factors remain equal, we may incur impairment charges in the future. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which they are recorded. See Note 6. Asset Impairments and Note 7. Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information.\nWe have historically incurred losses and may not achieve profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred losses from operations during our history in the oil and natural gas business. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately $36.3 million as of December 31, 2018. Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on successfully addressing our going-concern issues, near-term capital needs and implementing economic acquisition, development and production activities, all of which are subject to many risks beyond our control.\nOur ability to sell our production and/or receive market prices for our production may be adversely affected by transportation capacity constraints and interruptions.\nIf the amount of oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids being produced by us and others exceeds the capacity of the various transportation pipelines and gathering systems available in our operating areas, it will be necessary for new transportation pipelines and gathering systems to be built. Or, in the case of oil and natural gas liquids, it will be necessary for us to rely more heavily on trucks to transport our production, which is more expensive and less efficient than transportation via pipeline. The construction of new pipelines and gathering systems is capital intensive and construction may be postponed, interrupted or cancelled in response to changing economic conditions and the availability and cost of capital. In addition, capital constraints could limit our ability to build gathering systems to transport our production to transportation pipelines. In such event, costs to transport our production may increase materially or we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or sell our production at much lower prices than market or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our production may also be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous other reasons, including as a result of operational issues, mechanical breakdowns, weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it would likely adversely affect our cash flow.\nOur oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are sold in a limited number of geographic markets so an oversupply in any of those areas could have a material negative effect on the price we receive.\nOur oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are sold in a limited number of geographic markets and each has a fixed amount of storage and processing capacity. As a result, if such markets become oversupplied with oil, natural gas and/or natural gas liquids, it could have a material negative effect on the prices we receive for our products and therefore an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There is a risk that refining capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast may be insufficient to refine all of the light sweet crude oil being produced in the United States. If light sweet crude oil production remains at current levels or continues to increase, demand for our light crude oil production could result in widening price discounts to the world crude prices and potential shut in or reduction of production due to a lack of sufficient markets despite the lift on prior restrictions on the exporting of oil and natural gas from the United States.\nWe may not be able to drill wells on a substantial portion of our leasehold acreage.\nWe may not be able to drill on a substantial portion of our acreage for various reasons. We may not generate or be able to raise sufficient capital to do so. Deterioration in commodities prices may also make drilling certain properties or acreage uneconomic. Our actual drilling activities and future drilling budget will depend on prior drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. In addition, any drilling activities we are able to conduct may not be successful or add additional proved reserves to our overall proved reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApproximately 28.3% of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 28.3% of our net leasehold acreage was undeveloped, or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Unless production is established on the undeveloped acreage covered by our leases, such leases will expire. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income, are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage. We may also lose the right to claim certain proved undeveloped reserves in our engineering and financial reports if we cannot demonstrate the probability of developing those reserves within prescribed time frames, usually within five years. Further, to the extent we determine that it is not economic to develop particular undeveloped acreage; we may intentionally allow leases to expire.\nUnless we replace our reserves with new reserves and develop those reserves, our production and estimated reserves will decline, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or future cash flows.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that may vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Decline rates are typically greatest early in the productive life of a well, particularly horizontal wells. Estimates of the decline rate of an oil or natural gas well are inherently imprecise and may be less precise with respect to new or emerging oil and natural gas formations with limited production histories than for more developed formations with established production histories. Our production levels and the reserves that we currently expect to recover from our wells will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances. Unless we conduct successful ongoing acquisition and development activities or continually acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Thus, our estimated future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flows and results of operations are highly dependent upon our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, our cash flows and the value of our reserves will decrease, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves involve assumptions and any material inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities and the value of those reserves.\nThis report contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by SEC regulations relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and requires significant decisions, complex analyses and assumptions in evaluating available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise.\nOur actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those estimated. Any significant variance will likely materially affect the estimated quantities and the estimated value of our reserves. In addition, we may later adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nQuantities of estimated proved reserves are based on economic conditions in existence during the period of assessment. Changes to oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in the markets for these commodities may shorten the economic lives of certain fields because it may become uneconomical to produce all recoverable reserves in such fields, which may reduce proved reserves estimates.\nNegative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves have the effect of increasing the rates of depletion on the affected properties, which decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depletion expense. These revisions, as well as revisions in the assumptions of future estimated cash flows of those reserves, may also trigger impairment losses on certain properties, which may result in non-cash charges to earnings. See Note 7 - Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nAt December 31, 2018, none of our estimated reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. The estimates of these oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the costs associated with development of these reserves have been prepared in accordance with SEC regulations; however, actual capital expenditures will likely vary from estimated capital expenditures, development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not be as estimated.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves may not be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves set forth in this report is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements in effect at December 31, 2018 and 2017, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas arithmetic average prices without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u25cf\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nactual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u25cf\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and incurring expenses related to developing and producing oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general. As a corporation, we are treated as a taxable entity for statutory income tax purposes and our future income taxes will be dependent on our future taxable income. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the estimates included in this report which could have a material effect on the value of our estimated reserves.\nOur oil and natural gas activities are subject to various risks which are beyond our control.\nOur operations are subject to many risks and hazards incident to exploring and drilling for, producing, transporting, marketing and selling oil and natural gas. Although we may take precautionary measures, many of these risks and hazards are beyond our control and unavoidable under the circumstances. Many of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses, the ability of certain of our wells to produce oil and natural gas in commercial and economic quantities, the rate of production and the economics of the development of, and our investment in the prospects in which we have or will acquire an interest. Any of these risks and hazards could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such risks and hazards include:\n\u25cf\nhuman error, accidents, labor force issues and other factors beyond our control that may cause personal injuries or death to persons and destruction or damage to equipment and facilities;\n\u25cf\nblowouts, fires, hurricanes, pollution and equipment failures that may result in damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and equipment and increased drilling and production costs;\n\u25cf\nunavailability of materials and equipment;\n\u25cf\nengineering and construction delays;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated transportation costs and infrastructure delays;\n\u25cf\nunfavorable weather conditions;\n\u25cf\nhazards resulting from unusual or unexpected geological or environmental conditions;\n\u25cf\nenvironmental regulations and requirements;\n\u25cf\naccidental leakage of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids, drilling fluids or salt water, into the environment;\n\u25cf\nhazards resulting from the presence of hydrogen sulfide or other contaminants in natural gas we produce;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws and regulations, including laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas activities or markets for the oil and natural gas produced;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in supply and demand for oil and natural gas causing variations of the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production; and\n\u25cf\nthe availability of alternative fuels and the price at which they become available.\nAs a result of these risks, expenditures, quantities and rates of production, revenues and operating costs may be materially affected and may differ materially from those anticipated by us.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and crews, other equipment, supplies, water, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there have been shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, water or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases. Increasing levels of exploration and production may increase the demand for oilfield services and equipment, and the costs of these services and equipment may increase, while the quality of these services and equipment may suffer. The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment, supplies or qualified personnel can materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nOur exploration and development drilling efforts and the operation of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nWe have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. We acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our results of operations over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our leaseholds. Additionally, we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells.\nIn addition, we may not be successful in controlling our drilling and production costs to improve our overall return. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. We cannot predict the cost of drilling and completing a well, and we may be forced to limit, delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u25cf\ndownhole and well completion difficulties;\n\u25cf\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u25cf\nequipment failures or breakdowns, or accidents and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling and completion equipment and services;\n\u25cf\nfires, explosions, blowouts and surface cratering;\n\u25cf\nadverse weather conditions, including hurricanes; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance with governmental requirements.\nWe participate in oil and natural gas leases with third parties who may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects.\nIn some cases, we operate but own less than 100% of the working interest in the oil and natural gas leases on which we conduct operations, and other parties own the remaining portion of the working interest. Financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person. We could be held liable for joint activity obligations of other working interest owners, such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of other working interest owners. In addition, declines in oil and natural gas prices may increase the likelihood that some of these working interest owners, particularly those that are smaller and less established, are not able to fulfill their joint activity obligations. A partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs, and, in some cases, a partner may declare bankruptcy. In the event any of our project partners do not pay their share of such costs, we would likely have to pay those costs, and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover these costs from our partners, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nWe depend on the skill, ability and decisions of third-party operators of the oil and natural gas properties in which we have a non-operated working interest.\nThe success of the drilling, development and production of the oil and natural gas properties in which we have or expect to have a non-operating working interest is substantially dependent upon the decisions of such third-party operators and their diligence to comply with various laws, rules and regulations affecting such properties. The success and timing of our drilling, development and production activities on such properties operated by third-parties therefore depends upon a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ntiming and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u25cf\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u25cf\nthe rate of production of reserves, if any;\n\u25cf\napproval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u25cf\nselection of technology.\nThe failure of third-party operators to make decisions, perform their services, discharge their obligations, deal with regulatory agencies, and comply with laws, rules and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations in a proper manner with respect to properties in which we have an interest could result in material adverse consequences to our interest in such properties, including substantial penalties and compliance costs. Such adverse consequences could result in substantial liabilities to us or reduce the value of our properties, which could materially affect our results of operations. As a result, our ability to exercise influence over the operations of some of our current or future properties is and may be limited.\nOur use of seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nWe design and generate in-house 3-D seismic survey programs on many of our projects. We may use seismic studies to assist with assessing prospective drilling opportunities on current properties, as well as on properties that we may acquire. Such seismic studies are merely an interpretive tool and do not necessarily guarantee that hydrocarbons are present or if present will produce in economic quantities. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical.\nA component of our growth may come through acquisitions, and our failure to identify or complete future acquisitions successfully could reduce our earnings and slow our growth.\nIn assessing potential acquisitions, we consider information available in the public domain and information provided by the seller. In the event publicly available data is limited, then, by necessity, we may rely to a large extent on information that may only be available from the seller, particularly with respect to drilling and completion costs and practices, geological, geophysical and petrophysical data, detailed production data on existing wells, and other technical and cost data not available in the public domain. Accordingly, the review and evaluation of businesses or properties to be acquired may not uncover all existing or relevant data, obligations or actual or contingent liabilities that could adversely impact any business or property to be acquired and, hence, could adversely affect us as a result of the acquisition. These issues may be material and could include, among other things, unexpected environmental liabilities, title defects, unpaid royalties, taxes or other liabilities. If we acquire properties on an \u201cas-is\u201d basis, we may have limited or no remedies against the seller with respect to these types of problems.\nThe success of any acquisition that we complete will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to accurately assess the reserves associated with the acquired properties, assumptions related to future oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors. These assessments are often inexact and subjective. As a result, we may not recover the purchase price of a property from the sale of production from the property or recognize an acceptable return from such sales or operations.\nOur ability to achieve the benefits that we expect from an acquisition will also depend on our ability to efficiently integrate the acquired operations. Management may be required to dedicate significant time and effort to the integration process, which could divert its attention from other business opportunities and concerns. The challenges involved in the integration process may include retaining key employees and maintaining employee morale, addressing differences in business cultures, processes and systems and developing internal expertise regarding acquired properties.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that from time to time are amended to impose more stringent requirements that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nCompanies that explore for and develop, produce, sell and transport oil and natural gas in the United States are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including complex tax and environmental, health and safety laws and the corresponding regulations, and are required to obtain various permits and approvals from federal, state and local agencies. If these permits are not issued or unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include:\n\u25cf\nwater discharge and disposal permits for drilling operations;\n\u25cf\ndrilling bonds;\n\u25cf\ndrilling permits;\n\u25cf\nreports concerning operations;\n\u25cf\nair quality, air emissions, noise levels and related permits;\n\u25cf\nspacing of wells;\n\u25cf\nrights-of-way and easements;\n\u25cf\nunitization and pooling of properties;\n\u25cf\npipeline construction;\n\u25cf\ngathering, transportation and marketing of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf\ntaxation; and\n\u25cf\nwaste and water transport and disposal permits and requirements.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to liabilities, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Compliance costs can be significant. Moreover, the laws governing our operations or the enforcement thereof could change in ways that substantially increase the costs of doing business. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we also could be held liable for personal injuries, property damage (including site clean-up and restoration costs) and other damages including the assessment of natural resource damages. Such laws may impose strict as well as joint and several liability for environmental contamination, which could subject us to liability for the conduct of others or for our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such actions were taken. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations also increase the costs to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects. Part of the regulatory environment in which we operate includes, in some cases, federal requirements for performing or preparing environmental assessments, environmental impact studies and/or plans of development before commencing exploration and production activities.\nIn addition, our activities are subject to regulation by oil and natural gas-producing states relating to conservation practices and protection of correlative rights. These regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of oil and natural gas we may produce and sell. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or necessary permits, the failure to obtain a permit or the receipt of a permit with excessive conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore on, develop or produce our properties. The oil and natural gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations and, consequently, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nWe engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with many of the wells for which we are the operator. Federal, state and local governments have been adopting or considering restrictions on or prohibitions of fracturing in areas where we currently conduct operations, or in the future plan to conduct operations. Consequently, we could be subject to additional levels of regulation, operational delays or increased operating costs and could have additional regulatory burdens imposed upon us that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nFrom time to time, for example, legislation has been proposed in Congress to amend the SDWA to require federal permitting of hydraulic fracturing and the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Further, the EPA completed a study finding that hydraulic fracturing could potentially harm drinking water resources under adverse circumstances such as injection directly into groundwater or into production wells lacking mechanical integrity. Other governmental reviews have also been recently conducted or are under way that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. For example, on March 26, 2015, the BLM published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. Also, on November 15, 2016, the BLM finalized a waste preventing rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and natural gas operations on federal and Indian lands. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the above rules and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule; however, a coalition of environmentalists, tribal advocates and the state of California filed lawsuits challenging the rule rescission. Also, on February 22, 2018, the BLM published proposed amendments to the waste prevention rule that would eliminate certain air quality provisions and, on April 4, 2018, a federal district court stayed certain provisions of the 2016 rule. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the rules will be implemented, and what impact they would have on our operations. Further, legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of \u201cunderground injection\u201d and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. Several states and local jurisdictions in which we operate also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids.\nMore recently, federal and state governments have begun investigating whether the disposal of produced water into underground injection wells has caused increased seismic activity in certain areas. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances such as water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water, injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources, discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters, and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The results of these studies could lead federal and state governments and agencies to develop and implement additional regulations. In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment (\u201cCWT\u201d) facilities) accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities.\nThe proliferation of regulations may limit our ability to operate. If the use of hydraulic fracturing is limited, prohibited or subjected to further regulation, these requirements could delay or effectively prevent the extraction of oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present a danger to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards for these emissions.\nEPA rulemakings related to GHG emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the U.S., including, among others, onshore and offshore production facilities, which include certain of our operations.\nFurthermore, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules, known as Subpart OOOOa, that establish new controls for emissions of methane from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. Following the change in presidential administration, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation concerning the regulations is ongoing. As a result, we cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements. However, given the long-term trend toward increasing regulation, future federal methane regulation of the oil and gas industry remains a possibility, and several states have separately imposed their own regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas production activities.\nWhile Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, no significant legislation to reduce GHG emissions has been adopted at the federal level. In the absence of Congressional action, a number of state and regional GHG restrictions have emerged. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulation programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Reduced demand for the oil and gas we produce could also have the effect of lowering the value of our reserves.\nDemand for our products may also be adversely affected by conservation plans and efforts undertaken in response to global climate change, including plans developed in connection with the recent Paris climate conference agreement reached in December 2015, which entered into force in November 2016. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process is uncertain and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. It should also be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Finally, increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of lawsuits brought by public and private entities against oil and gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions. Should we be targeted by any such litigation, we may incur liability, which, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, could be imposed without regard to causation or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability, use and disposal of water. New legislation and regulatory initiatives or restrictions relating to water disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWater is an essential component of our drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Wastewaters from our operations typically are disposed of via underground injection. Some studies have linked earthquakes in certain areas to underground injection, which is leading to greater public scrutiny of disposal wells. Any new environmental initiatives or regulations that restrict injection of fluids, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas, or that limit the withdrawal, storage or use of surface water or ground water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of our wells, could increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or cessation of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur more taxes and certain of our projects may become uneconomic if certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development are eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and natural gas exploration, development and production companies. Such legislative changes have included, but not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) did not directly affect deductions currently available to the oil and natural gas industry but any future changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and natural gas development, or increase costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTitle to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects.\nWe generally obtain title opinions on significant properties that we drill or acquire. However, there is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. Generally, under the terms of the operating agreements affecting our properties, any monetary loss is to be borne by all parties to any such agreement in proportion to their interests in such property. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss.\nWe cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and natural gas activities.\nWe maintain general and excess liability policies, which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards. These policies generally cover:\n\u25cf\npersonal injury;\n\u25cf\nbodily injury;\n\u25cf\nthird party property damage;\n\u25cf\nmedical expenses;\n\u25cf\nlegal defense costs;\n\u25cf\npollution in some cases;\n\u25cf\nwell blowouts in some cases; and\n\u25cf\nworkers compensation.\nAs is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage that we maintain will be sufficient to cover claims made against us in the future.\nRed Mountain Capital Partners LLC and its affiliates (\u201cRed Mountain\u201d) hold 23% of the voting power of our outstanding shares which gives Red Mountain a significant interest in the Company.\nRed Mountain holds approximately 23% of our outstanding shares of common stock on an as-converted basis. Accordingly, Red Mountain has the ability to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and, as a practical matter, will significantly influence corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote, including the election of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions, including a sale of substantially all of our assets, and Red Mountain may vote its shares in a manner that is adverse to the interests of our minority stockholders. For example, Red Mountain may be able to prevent a merger or similar transaction, including a transaction in which stockholders will receive a premium for their shares, even if our other stockholders are in favor of such transaction. Further, Red Mountain\u2019s position might adversely affect the market price of our common stock to the extent investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of a company with a significant stockholder.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, as well as conduct reservoir modeling and reserve estimation for compliance reporting.\nWe are dependent on digital technologies including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees, business partners, and stockholders, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves as well as other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions are also dependent on digital technology. The technologies needed to conduct oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities make certain information the target of theft or misappropriation.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for the purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites.\nOur technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period of time. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in the industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or competitive pressures may force us to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical, and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we are in a position to do so. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies used now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, the business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nTerrorist attacks aimed at energy operations could adversely affect our business.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other government action have led and may lead to further increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas and could affect these commodity markets or the financial markets used by us. In addition, the U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets may be a future target of terrorist organizations. These developments have subjected oil and natural gas operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attack on our facilities, the infrastructure depended upon for transportation of products, and, in some cases, those of other energy companies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on our key personnel, the loss of which could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe depend, to a large extent, on the services of a limited number of senior management personnel and directors. The loss of the services of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Restructuring Officer could negatively impact our future operations. We believe that our success is also dependent on our ability to continue to retain the services of a limited number of skilled technical personnel. Our inability to retain a new chief executive officer or retain other skilled technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future cash flows and the results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of drilling and rig activity, economic conditions in the oil and natural gas industry, general economic conditions or other events or factors that are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market for oil and natural gas exploration companies, in particular, have experienced large price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results or asset values of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously impact the market price and trading volume of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has been instituted against certain oil and natural gas exploration companies. If this type of litigation were instituted against us following a period of volatility in our common stock trading price, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future cash flows and the results of operations.\nThe low trading volume of our common stock may adversely affect the price of our shares and their liquidity.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NYSE American exchange, our common stock has experienced low trading volume. Limited trading volume may subject our common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for investors to sell shares at a price that is attractive to them.\nIf our common stock was delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock, and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market.\nIf our common stock were removed from listing with the NYSE American, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a penny stock, a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock, and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market.\nWe are able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred shares and set the terms of the preferred shares without seeking any further approval from our stockholders. The preferred shares that we have issued rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends and liquidation rights. We may issue additional preferred shares that rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, liquidation rights or voting rights. If we issue additional preferred shares in the future, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have issued in the past, and may in the future continue to issue, in the open market at prevailing prices or in capital markets offerings series of perpetual preferred stock with dividend and liquidation preferences that rank ahead of our common stock.\nOur failure to fulfill all of our registration requirements may cause us to suffer liquidated damages, which may be very costly.\nPursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement that we entered into with certain of our stockholders, we filed a registration statement with respect to securities issued and are required to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement, and therefore there can be no assurance that we will not incur damages with respect to such agreement.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders must look solely to a possible appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business. In addition, our Credit Agreement contains covenants that prohibit us from paying cash dividends on our common stock as long as such debt remains outstanding. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors in light of conditions then existing, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business conditions and other factors. Accordingly, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment, which may not occur.\nOur Series D preferred stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders. Such preferential rights could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and may result in the interests of the holders of the Series D preferred stock differing from those of our common stockholders.\nIn the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any other transaction deemed a liquidation event pursuant to the Certificate of Designation, including a sale of our company (a \u201cLiquidation\u201d), each holder of outstanding shares of our Series D preferred stock will be entitled to be paid out of our assets available for distribution to stockholders, before any payment may be made to the holders of our common stock, an amount per share equal to the original issue price, plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. If, upon such Liquidation, the amount that the holders of Series D preferred stock would have received if all outstanding shares of Series D preferred stock had been converted into shares of our common stock immediately prior to such Liquidation would exceed the amount they would receive pursuant to the preceding sentence, the holders of Series D preferred stock will receive such greater amount.\nDividends on the Series D preferred stock are cumulative and accrue quarterly, whether or not declared by our board of directors, at the rate of 7.0% per annum on the sum of the original issue price plus all unpaid accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, and payable in additional shares of Series D preferred stock. In addition to the dividends accruing on shares of Series D preferred stock described above, if we declare certain dividends on our common stock, we will be required to declare and pay a dividend on the outstanding shares of our Series D preferred stock on a pro rata basis with the common stock, determined on an as-converted basis. Our obligations to the holders of Series D preferred stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThere may be significant future dilution of our common stock.\nWe have a significant amount of derivative securities outstanding, which upon conversion, would result in substantial dilution. For example, the conversion of outstanding shares of Series D preferred stock in full could result in the issuance of approximately 3.5 million shares of common stock. To the extent outstanding stock appreciation rights under our long-term incentive plan are exercised or additional shares of restricted stock are issued to our employees, holders of our common stock will experience dilution. Furthermore, if we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, such sales could result in further dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the price of our outstanding securities to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part upon the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price of our common stock might be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage or fails to report about us on a regular basis, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 64822, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "YUMAQ"}
