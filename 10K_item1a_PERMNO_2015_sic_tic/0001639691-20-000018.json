{"cik": "1639691", "company": "LivaNova PLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. An investor should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe the following information identifies the most significant risks affecting us, but the risks and uncertainties included below are not the only ones related to our businesses. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to the Company\nThe global medical device industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nWe are in highly competitive markets characterized by increasingly complex products that are expensive to develop and manufacture with significant price competition. In the product lines in which we compete, we face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of specialized products. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes, or technologies, as discussed above, may make our products or proposed products less competitive. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies. Competitive factors include:\n\u2022\nproduct quality, reliability and performance;\n\u2022\nproduct technology;\n\u2022\nbreadth of product lines and product services;\n\u2022\nability to identify new market trends;\n\u2022\ncustomer support;\n\u2022\nprice;\n\u2022\ncapacity to recruit engineers, scientists and other qualified employees; and\n\u2022\nreimbursement approval from governmental payors and private healthcare insurance providers.\nShifts in industry market share can occur as a result of product issues, physician advisories, safety alerts, and publications about our products. The importance of product quality, product efficacy, and quality systems in the medical device industry cannot be overstated. In the current environment of managed care, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we are increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create, invest in, or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into our proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, and manufacture and successfully market our products. Additionally, we may experience design, manufacturing, marketing or other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new products or new versions of our existing products. As a result of such difficulties and delays, our development expenses may increase and, as a consequence, our results of operations could suffer.\nRisks related to the reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for supply may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales.\nWe maintain manufacturing operations in six countries located throughout the world and purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Any problem affecting a supplier (whether due to external or internal causes) could have a negative impact on us.\nIn a few limited cases, specific components and raw materials are purchased from primary or main suppliers (or in some cases, a single supplier) for reasons related to quality assurance, cost-effectiveness ratio and availability. While we work closely with our suppliers to ensure supply continuity, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will always be successful. Moreover, due to strict standards and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of our products, we may not be able to locate new supply sources quickly in response to a supply reduction or interruption, with negative effects on our ability to manufacture our products effectively and in a timely fashion.\nOur products are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations, and failure to obtain product approvals or clearance may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur medical devices and technologies, as well as our business activities, are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement, including by the FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, Health and Human Services - Office of the Inspector General, and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance or approval for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations, and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials or the market\u2019s or FDA\u2019s perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical studies does not always ensure that later clinical studies will be successful, and we cannot be sure that later studies will replicate the results of prior studies. Clinical studies must also be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice requirements administered by the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, and global regulatory bodies may undertake enforcement action against us based on a failure to adhere to these requirements. Any delay or termination of our clinical studies will delay the filing of product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize new products or product modifications. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical studies will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product\u2019s profile, which could inhibit further marketing and development of such products.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products, and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance, it may take a significant amount of time; require the expenditure of substantial resources; involve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance; and involve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products, or limit the proposed uses of our products.\nModifications to our marketed products may require new clearances or approvals and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until required clearances or approvals are obtained.\nAn element of our strategy is to continue to upgrade our products, add new features and expand clearance or approval of our current products to new indications. We have made modifications to our products in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. No assurance can be given that regulators will agree with any of our decisions not to seek clearance or approval.\nIf regulators require us to cease marketing and to recall a modified device until we obtain a new clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, operating results and future growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. Any recall requirement that we seek additional clearances or approvals could result in significant delays, fines, increased costs associated with modification of a product, loss of revenue, reputational damage and potential operating restrictions imposed by regulators.\nFailure to comply with product-related government regulations may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA and other applicable non-U.S. government agency regulations. For instance, many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with applicable regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on FDA\u2019s Form-483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. If the\nFDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending PMA applications or require certificates of non-U.S. governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or PMAs, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn addition, in the U.S., device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling, and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.\nGovernmental regulations outside the U.S. have, and may continue to, become increasingly stringent and common. In the EU, for example, Reg MDR, when it enters into full force in 2020, will include significant additional premarket and post-market requirements. Penalties for regulatory non-compliance could be severe, including fines and revocation or suspension of a company\u2019s business license, mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions. Future laws and regulations may also have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf our marketed medical devices are defective or otherwise pose safety risks, the FDA and similar non-U.S. governmental authorities could require their recall or initiate an enforcement action, or we may initiate a recall of our products voluntarily.\nThe FDA and similar non-U.S. governmental authorities may require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers, on their own initiative, may recall a product with a material deficiency. We have initiated voluntary product recalls in the past. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our revenue.\nA government-mandated recall or voluntary recall by us or one of our sales agencies could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies or issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Any recall could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner. We also may be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future revenue and our ability to generate profits. In the future, we may initiate voluntary withdrawal, removal or repair actions that we determine do not require notification as a recall. If the regulating authority disagrees with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions as recalls. In addition, if we conduct a recall but fail to report it, we could be subject to enforcement action.\nIn addition, depending on the corrective action we take to redress a device\u2019s deficiencies or defects, the regulators may require, or we may decide, that we need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the device before we market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, or litigation, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating the business, and may harm our reputation and financial results. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines.\nAs a manufacturer of medical devices, we will continue to be exposed to product liability claims that could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and tarnish our reputation.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. In addition, many of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time. Component failures, manufacturing defects, design flaws or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to these or other products we manufacture or sell could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient. The occurrence of such an event could result in product liability claims or a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products. We have elected to self-insure with respect to a significant portion of our product liability risks and also hold global insurance policies to cover a portion of future potential losses. Product\nliability claims or product recalls in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers for our products, and losses from product liability claims in the future could exceed our product liability insurance coverage and lead to a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, future unanticipated large liability claims may raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are currently involved in litigation that could adversely affect our business and financial results, divert management\u2019s attention from our business, and subject us to significant liabilities.\nAs described under \u201cNote 14. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are involved in various litigation matters that may adversely affect our financial condition and may require us to devote significant resources to our defense of these claims.\nSuch litigation includes a federal multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania and cases in various state courts and jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to our 3T Heater-Cooler product. As of March 2, 2020, we are aware of approximately 95 filed and unfiled claims worldwide, with the majority of the claims filed in various federal or state courts throughout the U.S. The number includes cases that have settled but have not yet been dismissed. The complaints generally seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment and violations of various state consumer protection statutes. In the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a $294.1 million litigation provision and in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2019 we recognized an additional $33.2 million litigation provision related to these claims. Although we are defending these matters vigorously, we cannot predict the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter.\nGlobal healthcare policy changes and tightening of reimbursement for products may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn response to increases in healthcare costs, there have been and continue to be proposals by governments, regulators and third-party payors to control these costs. These proposals have resulted in efforts to enact healthcare system reforms that may lead to pricing restrictions, limits on the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and use of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur ability to commercialize our products is dependent, in large part, on whether third-party payors, including private healthcare insurers, managed care plans, governmental programs and others agree to cover the costs and services associated with our products and related procedures in the U.S. and internationally.\nOur products are purchased principally by healthcare providers that typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.) and private insurance plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The availability of adequate reimbursement affects the decision as to which procedures are performed, which products are purchased and what prices customers are willing to pay. After we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product if reimbursement approval is not obtained from private and governmental third-party payors. In addition, periodic changes to reimbursement methodologies could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur failure to comply with rules relating to reimbursement of healthcare goods and services, healthcare fraud and abuse, false claims and other applicable laws or regulations may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation and business operations.\nOur devices and therapies are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies worldwide responsible for coverage, reimbursement and regulation of healthcare goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and health care fraud. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.\nThe risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships with surgeons and other healthcare providers, some of whom recommend, purchase and/or prescribe our devices, group purchasing organizations and our independent sales agents and distributors, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.\nPatient confidentiality and federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations may adversely impact our financial position and reputation.\nHIPAA establishes federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information in the U.S. In addition to HIPAA, virtually every U.S. state has enacted laws to safeguard privacy, and these laws vary significantly from state to state and change frequently. The privacy and security rules address the use and disclosure of individual healthcare information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed. The operation of our business involves the collection and use of substantial amounts of \u201cprotected health information.\u201d If we fail to comply with the applicable regulations, we could suffer civil penalties up to or exceeding $50,000 per violation, with a maximum of $1.5 million for multiple violations of an identical requirement during a calendar year and criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 and potential imprisonment.\nSimilarly, the EU\u2019s GDPR protects the privacy and security of \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d and personal health information relating to individuals within the EU and, like HIPAA, GDPR addresses the use and disclosure of individual healthcare information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed. It subjects us to a rigorous proactive compliance scheme, and if we fail to comply with the GDPR, we could be sued for compensation by individuals who have suffered material or non-material damage and could suffer administrative fines up to the higher of \u20ac20.0 million (approximately $22.4 million), or 4% of the total worldwide annual revenue of the group in the previous financial year. We may also be subject to criminal sanctions.\nCyber-attacks or other disruptions to our information technology systems could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, fines, harm to our competitive position and loss of reputation.\nWe are increasingly dependent on our own sophisticated information technology systems and those of third parties to operate our business, and certain products of ours include integrated software and information technology. We rely on information technology systems to collect and process customer orders, manage product manufacturing and shipping and support regulatory compliance, and we routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data, including sensitive personal information, protected health information and confidential business information. Many of our products incorporate software and information technology that allow patients and physicians to be connected and collect data regarding a patient and the therapy he or she is receiving, or that otherwise allow the products or services to operate as intended. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations but the size and complexity of our products and the information technology systems on which we rely make them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, breakdown, interruptions, destruction, loss or compromise of data, obsolescence or incompatibility among systems or other significant disruptions. Unauthorized persons routinely attempt to access our products or systems in order to disrupt, disable or degrade such products or services, to obtain proprietary or confidential information, or to remotely disrupt or access the systems of large health care providers by exploiting our products or systems. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. The negative publicity resulting from such disruptions could significantly impact our reputation and stock price.\nIn addition, we continue to grow, in part, through new business acquisitions. As a result of acquisitions, we may face risks due to implementation, modification, or remediation of controls, procedures and policies relating to data privacy and cybersecurity at the acquired company. We continue to consolidate and over time integrate the number of systems we operate, and to upgrade and expand our information system capabilities for stable and secure business operations. There can be no assurance that our process of consolidating, protecting, upgrading and expanding our systems and capabilities, continuing to build security into the design of our products, and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption or destruction of these systems, as well as any data breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain secure, reliable information technology systems and prevent disruptions, outages, or data breaches, we may suffer legal and regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. Our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations, including data protection and cyber-security laws and regulations, in many jurisdictions. For example, if we are in breach of the GDPR\u2019s or CCPA\u2019s requirement that we ensure a level of security, both in terms of technology and other organizational measures, appropriate to the risk that the confidentiality, integrity or availability of personally identifiable data is compromised, we could be subject to fines and enforcement actions. Despite programs to comply with such laws and regulations, there is no guarantee that we will avoid enforcement actions by governmental bodies. Enforcement actions may be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. In addition, there is a trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data or other cyber-attacks pursuant to laws such as CCPA. While we have\nnot been named in any such lawsuits, if a breach or loss of data occurs, we could become a target of civil litigation or government enforcement actions.\nQuality problems with our processes, goods, and services could harm our reputation for producing high-quality products and erode our competitive advantage, sales, and market share.\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure. Our quality certifications are critical to the marketing success of our goods and services. If we fail to meet these standards, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers, and our revenue and results of operations could decline. Aside from specific customer standards, our success depends generally on our ability to manufacture precision-engineered components, sub-assemblies, and finished products to exact tolerances and from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality components will be harmed, our competitive advantage could be damaged, and we could lose customers and market share.\nOur R&D efforts rely on investments and investment collaborations, and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful.\nOur strategy to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller, healthier lives requires a wide variety of technologies, products and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. As a result, we also rely on investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing or legacy businesses as well as in new areas.\nWe expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development of, or acquire new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses. Investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated earnings, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so. Physician customers have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies, and intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation, and intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. Patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products. While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, these patents, trade secrets, or other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property.\nFurther, pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us. Patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology and may limit our competitive advantage. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We also rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.\nThe laws and intellectual property systems of certain countries in which we market some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S., which may impact our market position in those countries. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in those countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nWe may experience volatility in the trading price of our shares due to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results or other factors.\nWe experienced volatility in the trading price of our shares during 2019, including following the pre-release of our earnings for the first quarter thereof. In the future, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to many factors, including factors beyond our control, which may cause further volatility in the trading price of our shares. A number of other factors may also cause future volatility in our stock price, including the items discussed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities, violations and litigation in multiple jurisdictions.\nOur operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes in the various jurisdictions where we operate. Certain environmental laws assess liability on current, prior and/or related owners or operators of real property for the costs or investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substance at their properties or at properties on which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition, a governmental authority may seek to hold us liable for successor liability violations committed by any companies in which we invest or that we acquire. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing or future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup and the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations. The costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, may exceed our estimates, or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally.\nWe develop, manufacture, distribute and sell our products globally and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities worldwide. Our international operations are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business overseas and under non-U.S. laws, regulations and customs. These risks include possible nationalization, negative consequences associated with Brexit, expropriation, importation limitations, pricing restrictions and violations of laws. Our profitability and operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:\n\u2022\nlocal product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022\nlonger-term receivables than are typical in the EU or the U.S.;\n\u2022\ndifficulty enforcing agreements;\n\u2022\ncreditworthiness of customers;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferent labor regulations and workforce instability;\n\u2022\nhigher danger of terrorist activity, war or civil unrest;\n\u2022\nselling our products through distributors and agents;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability; and\n\u2022\nthe risks further described above in the section entitled \u201cThe failure to comply with anti-bribery laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.\u201d\nWe transact business in numerous countries around the world and expect that a significant portion of our business will continue to take place in international markets. Consolidated financial statements are prepared in our functional currency, while the financial statements of each of our subsidiaries are prepared in the functional currency of that entity. Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the functional currencies of our foreign currency entities against our functional currency will impact our results of operations and financial condition. Although we may elect to hedge certain foreign currency exposure, we cannot be certain that the hedging activity will eliminate our currency risk.\nIn addition, in many of the countries where we operate, employees are covered by various laws and/or collective bargaining agreements that endow them, through their local or national representatives, with the right to be consulted in relation to specific issues, including the downsizing or closing of departments and staff reductions. The laws and/or collective bargaining agreements that are applicable to these agreements could have an impact on our flexibility, as they apply to programs to redefine and/or strategically reposition our activities. Our ability to implement staff downsizing programs or even temporary interruptions of employment relationships is predicated on the approval of government entities and the consent of labor unions. A negative response from a works council or union-organized work stoppages by employees could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe have significant global sales and operations and face risks related to health epidemics that could impact our sales and operating results.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in China. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. These could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers, the deferral of procedures in impacted countries or the temporary suspension of operations by us or our suppliers or customers. At the end of February 2020, for example, we temporarily closed a small administrative office in Milan, Italy and we continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation. While we have not closed our two manufacturing plants in Italy as they are not in the impacted regions, there can be no assurance that they will not need to shut down. Any disruption of our operations, or those of our suppliers or customers, could impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and likely impact our operating results.\nThe failure to comply with anti-bribery laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the UK Bribery Act, FCPA and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The UK Bribery Act, FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Because of the predominance of government-administered healthcare systems in many parts of the world outside the U.S., many of our customer relationships are potentially subject to such laws.\nWe are, therefore, exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, independent sales agents and distributors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity in violation of these laws and our Code of Conduct. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.\nGlobal enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by governmental agencies, and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, including exclusion from government contracting or government healthcare programs, and could negatively affect our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nOur debt instruments require us to comply with affirmative covenants and specified financial covenants and ratios.\nCertain restrictions and covenants in our debt instruments could affect our ability to operate and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance capital needs. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic, financial, regulatory and industry conditions. If any of these restrictions or covenants is breached, we could be in default under one or more of our debt instruments, which, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of the indebtedness under such agreements and cross defaults under our other debt instruments. Any such actions could result in the enforcement of our lenders\u2019 security interests and/or force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to integrate recently acquired businesses or to successfully complete and integrate future acquisitions could limit our future growth or otherwise be disruptive to our ongoing business.\nFrom time to time, we acquire businesses and expect to pursue acquisitions in support of our strategic goals. There can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available on acceptable terms or at all, or that we will be able to obtain necessary financing or regulatory approvals to complete potential acquisitions. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any businesses we may acquire into our existing business. The integration of the\noperations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, human resources, R&D, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing, legal, compliance and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management\u2019s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects. Failure to manage and coordinate the growth of the combined company successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we cannot be certain that our investments, alliances and acquired businesses will become profitable or remain so. If our investments, alliances or acquisitions are not successful, we may record unexpected impairment charges.\nWe may incur impairments of intangible assets and goodwill, primarily acquired in acquisitions, including the merger between Sorin and Cyberonics, that adversely affect our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of our net intangible assets and goodwill totaled $1.5 billion, which represents 63.2% of our total assets. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of our net intangible assets and goodwill totaled $1.7 billion, which represented 67.7% of our total assets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we determined that the In Process Research and Development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) asset relating to ImThera was impaired and as a result, recorded an impairment of $50.3 million, and we also fully impaired the goodwill and the IPR&D asset associated with the discontinuation of the Caisson business by recording a $42.4 million impairment to goodwill and a $89.0 million impairment to the IPR&D asset.\nWe review, when circumstances warrant, the carrying amounts of our intangible assets to determine whether those carrying amounts continue to be recoverable in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our businesses, significant unexpected or planned changes in the use of assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines, among other events, may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets. Current impairments have significantly affected our financial results and future impairments could significantly affect reported financial results.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry companies, including medical device companies, are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions for medical devices that incorporate components we produce. Increasing pricing pressures as a result of industry consolidation could have an adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe success and continuing development of our products depend on maintaining strong relationships with physicians and healthcare professionals.\nIf we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals, our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product consultants, inventors and public speakers, and we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience. If we are unable to maintain these strong relationships, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nInadequate funding for U.S. federal government agencies and government shutdowns could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel, government shutdowns and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Disruptions at the FDA and in other U.S. federal agencies may increase the time necessary for new medical devices to be reviewed and/or approved which would adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, a portion of our revenue is dependent on U.S. federal government healthcare program reimbursement. Any disruption in U.S. federal government operations, including government shutdowns, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks from Tax, Residency and Jurisdiction of Incorporation\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in the U.S., the UK, the EU and various other jurisdictions. No assurances can be given as to what our worldwide effective corporate tax rate will be because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax regulations and laws, enactment and enforceability thereof and policies of the jurisdictions where we operate. Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectations or from historical trends and that variance may\nbe material. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We believe that our accruals reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of ongoing audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income (loss) or financial condition.\nThe IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and we may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.\nBased on our management and organizational structure, we believe that we should be regarded as a resident exclusively in the UK for tax purposes and that we are appropriately treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. Although we are incorporated in the UK, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes. If we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to substantially greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated as a non-U.S. corporation.\nThe IRS may limit Cyberonics\u2019 and its U.S. affiliates\u2019 ability to utilize their U.S. tax attributes and impose an excise tax on gains recognized by certain individuals as a result of the merger of Cyberonics and Sorin.\nThe merger of Cyberonics and Sorin is considered an inversion for tax purposes. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) and regulations under the IRC impose a minimum level of tax on any \u201cinversion gain\u201d of a U.S. corporation (and any U.S. person related to the U.S. corporation) depending on the resulting percentage ownership by U.S. persons of the merged company. The effect of this provision in the IRC is to deny the use of certain U.S. tax attributes (including net operating losses and certain tax credits) to offset U.S. tax liability, if any, attributable to such inversion gain. In addition, an excise tax may be imposed on certain individuals. In our case, we believe that the former stockholders of Cyberonics own less than the IRC\u2019s stated percentage of the Company. However, the final regulations relating to calculating the ownership percentage are new and subject to interpretation, and thus it cannot be assured that the IRS will agree with our position.\nThe UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d could lead to increased market volatility and make it more difficult for us to do business in Europe or have other adverse effects on our business.\nOn January 31, 2020, the UK departed from the EU and has entered a transition period that is scheduled to end on December 31, 2020, unless extended. Brexit could adversely affect UK, European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro. For the three months and full year ended December 31, 2019, net sales generated from our European operations constituted approximately 20% and 21%, respectively, of total net sales. Although the long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the UK makes to retain access to the EU markets during the transition period, Brexit has created additional uncertainties that may ultimately result in new regulatory costs and challenges for medical device companies and increased restrictions on imports and exports throughout Europe. In addition, we and several of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are domiciled either in the UK, various EU Member States, or in the U.S., are parties to intercompany transactions and agreements under which we receive various tax reliefs and exemptions in accordance with applicable international tax laws, treaties and regulations that could be materially changed by Brexit. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our ability to conduct and expand our operations in Europe and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs an English public limited company, certain capital structure decisions will require shareholder approval, which may limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure.\nWe are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Under English law, our board of directors may only allot shares with the prior authorization of shareholders. Our articles of association currently authorize the allotment of additional shares for a period of five years up to an aggregate of approximately 9.8 million shares. English law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash; which rights may be excluded by shareholders. Our articles currently exclude preemptive rights in relation to the allotment of shares for cash. In addition, English law also generally prohibits a public company from repurchasing its own shares without the prior approval of shareholders. The approval of the allotment of additional shares, the exemption of statutory preemptive rights and the restriction on repurchase of shares must all be renewed by shareholders at least every five years. We cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities.\nTransfers of our shares, other than ones effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d), may be subject to UK stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax (\u201cSDRT\u201d).\nTransfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in DTC are not subject to UK stamp duty or SDRT. However, if a shareholder holds our shares directly rather than through DTC, any transfer of shares could be subject to UK stamp duty on SDRT at a rate of 0.5% of the consideration paid for the transfer and certain issues or transfers of shares to depositories or into clearance services are charged at a rate of 1.5% of the consideration paid for the transfer. The transferee generally pays the UK stamp duty or SDRT. The potential for UK stamp duty or SDRT could adversely affect the trading price of our shares.\nThe facilities of DTC are a widely used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms. Our shares are at present, subject to certain conditions, generally eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system. However, DTC generally has discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for our shares. If DTC determines at any time that our shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, then we believe that our shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange and trading in our shares would be disrupted. While we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve the listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our shares.", "PERMNO": 78881, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "LIVN"}
