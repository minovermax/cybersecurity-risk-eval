{"cik": "875357", "company": "BOK FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nBOK Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries could be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations, as well as on its common stock and other financial instruments. Risk factors which are significant to the Company include, but are not limited to:\nGeneral and Regulatory Risk Factors\nAdverse factors could impact BOK Financial's ability to implement its operating strategy.\nAlthough BOK Financial has developed an operating strategy, which it expects to result in continuing improved financial performance, BOK Financial cannot ensure that it will be successful in fulfilling this strategy or that this operating strategy will be successful. Achieving success is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond BOK Financial's direct control. Factors that may adversely affect BOK Financial's ability to implement its operating strategy include:\n\u2022deterioration of BOK Financial's asset quality;\n\u2022deterioration in general economic conditions, especially in BOK Financial's core markets;\n\u2022inability to control BOK Financial's non-interest expenses;\n\u2022inability to increase non-interest income;\n\u2022inability to access capital;\n\u2022decreases in net interest margins;\n\u2022increases in competition;\n\u2022a breach in the security of BOK Financial's systems and\n\u2022adverse regulatory developments.\nSubstantial competition could adversely affect BOK Financial.\nBanking is a competitive business. BOK Financial competes actively for loan, deposit and other financial services business in the southwest region of the United States. BOK Financial's competitors include a large number of small and large local and national banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, trust companies, broker-dealers and underwriters, as well as many financial and non-financial firms that offer services similar to those of BOK Financial. Large national financial institutions have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources. Such large financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost than BOK Financial does, which may adversely affect BOK Financial's ability to compete effectively.\nBOK Financial has expanded into markets outside of Oklahoma, where it competes with a large number of financial institutions that have an established customer base and greater market share than BOK Financial. With respect to some of its services, BOK Financial competes with non-bank companies that are not subject to regulation. The absence of regulatory requirements may give non-banks a competitive advantage.\nThe increasingly competitive environment is in part a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. Our success depends on our ability to respond to the threats and opportunities of financial technology innovations. Developments in \"fintech\" and crypto-currencies have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business. Investment in new technology to stay competitive could result in significant costs and increased cybersecurity risk. Our success depends on our ability to adapt to the pace of the rapidly changing technological environment which is important to retention and acquisition of customers.\nGovernment regulations and political environment could adversely affect BOK Financial.\nBOK Financial and BOKF, NA are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit the type of acquisitions and investments that we may make. In addition, certain permitted acquisitions and investments are subject to prior review and approval by banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC. Banking regulators have broad discretion on whether to approve proposed acquisitions and investments. In deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other things, the effect of the acquisition on competition; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including our record of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act; and our effectiveness in combating money laundering. They will also consider our financial condition and our future prospects, including projected capital ratios and levels; the competence, experience, and integrity of our management; and our record of compliance with laws and regulations.\nRegulatory authorities may change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations, including the OCC, our primary regulator, and the CFPB, our regulator for certain designated consumer laws and regulations. Violations of laws and regulations could limit the growth potential of BOK Financial's businesses. We have made extensive investments in human and technological resources to address enhanced regulatory expectations, including investments in the areas of risk management, compliance, and capital planning. Political developments, including recent Federal executive and legislative changes, add additional uncertainty to the implementation, scope and timing of changes in the regulatory environment for the banking industry and for the broader economy.\nBOK Financial has a long-standing relationship with the energy industry and the local economies within BOKF's geographical footprint have a concentration in energy-related industries. The energy industry is facing increased pressure from investors and the government to mitigate greenhouse emissions, which could significantly increase costs, hinder financial results and shrink the industry.\nOur business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, BOKF\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the continued effectiveness of our business continuity plan, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, customers, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and the effectiveness of actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 virus and the resulting \"Stay at Home\" orders, travel restrictions, and closed schools and work places caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy, which has in turn disrupted the business activities and operations of our customers, as well as our business and operations. The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has resulted in millions of confirmed cases identified around the world, many in the U.S. As a result of the pandemic, many businesses were shut down or continue to be shut down, supply chains were interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable, and many individuals have become ill, quarantined, or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. While multiple vaccines have been developed, the timing of administration of the vaccines to the full population, number of people who will take the vaccines, and the efficacy on new variants of the virus remains unknown.\nSpecific to our operations, we face the following risks:\n\u2022The pandemic, combined with pre-existing factors, including, but not limited to, international trade disputes, inflation risks, and oil price volatility, could further destabilize the financial markets and markets in which the Company operates. The resulting impacts on consumers, including the sudden increase in the unemployment rate, could cause changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing needs, and saving habits, which will likely affect the demand for loans and other products or services the Company offers, as well as the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers.\n\u2022Governmental mandates forced shutdowns of many of our customers' and vendors' facilities. While some have reopened, others may extend for indefinite periods. This may cause customers, third-party service providers, and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to the Company.\n\u2022The COVID-19 virus may have an adverse effect on customer deposits, the ability of our borrowers to satisfy their obligations, the demand for our loans or other products and services, or on financial markets, real estate markets, or economic growth, which could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022The Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate to 0.00% to 0.25% on March 15, 2020 and announced a significant quantitative easing program in response to the economic downturn caused by COVID-19. These reductions, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect our net interest income and margins, the value of mortgage servicing rights, and our profitability.\n\u2022Widespread outbreaks of the COVID-19 virus in our primary geographies could adversely affect our workforce resulting in serious health issues and absenteeism. Social distancing measures enacted for working employees such as working from home, working in different locations, and working different shifts could further disrupt the workforce\nand normal internal control environment. This could lead to the inability to adequately meet customer needs, maintain adequate financial controls and cybersecurity controls, and meet regulatory deadlines.\n\u2022The determination of the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current expected credit losses. The COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented governmental response could make these subjective judgments even more difficult. The economic impact of the pandemic and government responses may have an adverse effect on current and forward prices for oil and natural gas, which could result in significant credit losses. The value of real estate and other collateral securing loans may also be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the preceding and other risks, if the COVID-19 virus continues to spread and the response to contain the pandemic is unsuccessful, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. These adverse impacts could lead to a material impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets assigned to our reporting units.\nCredit Risk Factors\nAdverse regional economic developments could negatively affect BOK Financial's business.\nAt December 31, 2020, loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Texas represented approximately 31% of the total loan portfolio, loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Oklahoma represented approximately 17% of our total loan portfolio and loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in Colorado represented approximately 12% of our total loan portfolio. These geographic concentrations subject the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within these areas. Poor economic conditions in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado or other markets in the southwest region may cause BOK Financial to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in BOK Financial's loan portfolio. A regional economic downturn could also adversely affect revenue from brokerage and trading activities, mortgage loan originations and other sources of fee-based revenue.\nExtended oil and gas commodity price downturns could negatively affect BOK Financial customers.\nAt December 31, 2020, 15% of BOK Financial's total loan portfolio is comprised of loans to borrowers in the energy industry. The energy industry is historically cyclical and prolonged periods of low oil and gas commodity prices could negatively impact borrowers' ability to pay. In addition, the Company does business in several major oil and natural gas producing states including Oklahoma, Texas and Colorado. The economies of these states could be negatively impacted by prolonged periods of low oil and gas commodity prices resulting in increased credit migration to classified and nonaccruing categories, higher loan loss provisions and risk of credit losses from both energy borrowers and businesses and individuals in those regional economies.\nOther adverse economic factors affecting particular industries could have a negative effect on BOK Financial customers and their ability to make payments to BOK Financial.\nCertain industry-specific economic factors also affect BOK Financial. For example, BOK Financial's loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans. A downturn in the real estate industry in general or in certain segments of the commercial real estate industry in the southwest region could also have an adverse effect on BOK Financial's operations. Regulatory changes in healthcare may negatively affect our customers. Legislation affecting reimbursement rates along with the continued transition to managed care in place of fee for service payments could affect their ability to pay.\nAdverse global economic factors could have a negative effect on BOK Financial customers and counterparties.\nEconomic conditions globally could impact BOK Financial\u2019s customers and counterparties with which we do business. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected economies around the world, the United Kingdom continues to work through issues regarding BREXIT, trade related issues remain between the United States and China, and tension exists amongst the United States and OPEC Plus countries, including Russia and countries in the Middle East, over oil production levels. We have no direct exposure to European sovereign debt and limited exposure to European and Chinese financial institutions. We have not identified any significant customer exposures to European sovereign debt, European financial institutions or Chinese financial institutions.\nBOK Financial, its customers and counterparties may also be negatively affected by global events, such as natural disasters, and other external events beyond our control, including public health issues, terrorist attacks and acts of war. These global events\nmay significantly affect long-term and short-term interest rates, energy prices, the value of financial assets and ultimately economic activity in our primary markets. The adverse effect of these events on the Company may include narrowing of the spread between interest income and interest expense, a reduction in fee income, an increase in credit losses and a decrease in demand for loans and other products and services.\nLiquidity and Interest Rate Risk Factors\nFluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect BOK Financial's business.\nBOK Financial's business is highly sensitive to:\n\u2022the monetary policies implemented by the Federal Reserve Board, including the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements, which affect BOK Financial's ability to make loans and the interest rates we may charge;\n\u2022changes in prevailing interest rates, due to the dependency of the subsidiary banks on interest income;\n\u2022changes in depositor behavior;\n\u2022open market operations in U.S. Government securities.\nA significant increase in market interest rates, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect both BOK Financial's ability to originate new loans and BOK Financial's ability to grow. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates could result in acceleration in the payment of loans, including loans underlying BOK Financial's holdings of residential mortgage-backed securities and termination of BOK Financial's mortgage servicing rights. In addition, changes in market interest rates, changes in the relationships between short-term and long-term market interest rates or changes in the relationships between different interest rate indices, could affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. This difference could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income, which would reduce the Company\u2019s net interest revenue. In a rising interest rate environment, the composition of the deposit portfolio could shift resulting in a mix that is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than is the current mix. An increase in market interest rates also could adversely affect the ability of BOK Financial's floating-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and net charge-offs, which could adversely affect BOK Financial's business.\nIn 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced its lack of confidence in LIBOR as a market benchmark rate, and that it would no longer persuade or compel banks to submit to LIBOR after 2021. U.S. regulatory authorities voiced similar support for phasing out LIBOR. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Alternative Reference Rate Committee has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as an alternative to LIBOR.\nIn November of 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), the FCA-regulated and authorized administrator of LIBOR, announced its intention to cease USD LIBOR for one-week and two-month tenors at the end of 2021, but extend the anticipated cessation date for the remaining USD LIBOR tenors to the end of June 2023. U.S. regulators released a joint inter-agency statement about their expectations that banks cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021.\nWe have a significant number of loans, securities, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. Given these uncertainties, it is not possible at this time to determine the impact of the transition away from LIBOR on the valuations, pricing and operation of our financial instruments. However, the proposed extension of our primary LIBOR tenors to June of 2023 reduces our exposure to the LIBOR transition significantly, as a large portion of our legacy financial instruments that matured after 2021 will mature before June of 2023.\nIn order to be well prepared for the transition, the Company has established formal governance for the LIBOR transition, including a LIBOR Transition Working Group (\"the Group\") whose purpose is to guide the overall transition process for the Company. The Group is an internal, cross-functional team with representatives from all business lines, support and control functions, and legal counsel. Its responsibilities include, but are not limited to, monitoring industry developments; tracking direct and indirect exposures; developing and implementing remediation plans; and communication with internal and external stakeholders.\nKey loan provisions have been modified so that new and renewed loans include LIBOR fallback language designed to ensure the smoothest possible transition from LIBOR to the new benchmark when such transition occurs. All existing financial contracts with direct exposure to LIBOR have been inventoried and are being tracked. Indirect exposures in the form of LIBOR-related systems, models, and processes have been inventoried, evaluated, and prioritized and remediation is underway.\nChanges in mortgage interest rates could adversely affect mortgage banking operations along with mortgage servicing rights as well as BOK Financial's substantial holdings of residential mortgage-backed securities, and brokerage and trading revenue.\nBOK Financial derives a substantial amount of revenue from mortgage banking activities, the production and sale of mortgage loans and the servicing of mortgage loans. In addition, as part of BOK Financial's mortgage banking business, BOK Financial has substantial holdings of mortgage servicing rights. Revenue generated from the production and sale of mortgage loans is affected by mortgage interest rates and government policies related to economic stimulus and home ownership. Falling interest rates tend to increase mortgage lending activities and related revenue while rising interest rates have an opposite effect.\nMortgage servicing revenue is a fee earned over the life of the related loan. However, mortgage servicing rights are assets that are carried at fair value which are very sensitive to numerous factors with the primary factor being changes in market interest rates. Falling interest rates tend to increase loan prepayments, which may lead to a decrease in the value of related servicing rights. We attempt to manage this risk by maintaining an active hedging program. The primary objective of the Company's hedging program is to provide an offset to changes in the fair value of these rights due to hedgeable risks, primarily changes in market interest rates. Due to numerous unhedgeable factors, hedging strategies may not offset all changes in the fair value of the asset. Such unhedgeable factors include, but are not limited to, changes in customer prepayment or delinquency behavior that is inconsistent with historical actual performance in a similar market environment; changes in the long-term or short-term primary/secondary mortgage spreads; and changes in survey-driven assumptions such as the cost of servicing and discount rates.\nWe also hold a substantial portfolio of residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies. The fair value of residential mortgage-backed securities is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. A significant decrease in interest rates may lead mortgage holders to refinance the mortgages constituting the pool backing the securities, subjecting BOK Financial to a risk of prepayment and decreased return on investment due to subsequent reinvestment at lower interest rates. A significant decrease in interest rates may also accelerate premium amortization. Conversely, a significant increase in interest rates may cause mortgage holders to extend the term over which they repay their loans, which delays the Company\u2019s opportunity to reinvest funds at higher rates. We mitigate this risk somewhat by investing principally in shorter duration mortgage products, which are less sensitive to changes in interest rates.\nIn addition, the Company actively engages in trading activities that provide U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities and related derivative instruments to our customers. Trading activities generate net interest revenue, trading revenue and customer hedging revenue. Trading revenue and customer hedging revenue varies in response to customer demand. The value of trading securities will increase in response to decreases in interest rates or decrease in response to increases in interest rates. We mitigate the market risk of holding trading securities through appropriate economic hedging techniques.\nMarket disruptions could impact BOK Financial\u2019s funding sources.\nBOK Financial\u2019s subsidiary bank may rely on other financial institutions and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka as a significant source of funds. Our ability to fund loans, manage our interest rate risk and meet other obligations depends on funds borrowed from these sources. The inability to borrow funds at market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOperating Risk Factors\nDependence on technology increases cybersecurity, data privacy and technology failure risk.\nThe Company is dependent on its technological ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions and store and protect a significant amount of sensitive customer information. Our customers\u2019 use of our internet-based services, and our customer and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security and reliability, have increased over time. We face compliance risks and costs relating to the data privacy laws existing in multiple jurisdictions. Congress and the legislatures of states in which we operate regularly consider legislation that would impose more stringent data privacy requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs.\nCybersecurity risks for financial institutions have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the increased use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and ever changing cyberattack techniques used by organized crime, hackers, terrorists, hostile foreign governments and other external parties to obtain confidential customer information and misappropriate customer funds. Such parties may seek to gain access to our systems directly or use equipment or security passwords belonging to employees,\ncustomers, third party services providers or other users of our systems. Accordingly, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, breakdowns and cyber attacks.\nOur business, financial, accounting, data processing systems and other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled as a result of a number of factors that may be wholly or partially beyond our control. In addition to cyber attacks, there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, pandemics, events arising from political or social matters, including terrorist attacks. Third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities including exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational or information security risk to the Company, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems, capacity constraints or cyber attacks.\nCybersecurity risk management programs are expensive to maintain and will not protect the Company from all risks associated with maintaining the security of customer data from external and internal intrusions, disaster recovery and failures in controls used by our vendors. A material breach of customer data security or operational or system failure may negatively impact our business reputation and cause a loss of customers, result in increased expense to contain the event and/or require that we provide credit monitoring services for or reimburse affected customers, result in regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, or result in litigation, all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches or operational failures, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened and as a result the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect and facilitate the recovery of our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remains a high priority for us. As an additional layer of protection, we have purchased network and privacy liability risk insurance coverage. Our cybersecurity insurance may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a breach, or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms.\nWe depend on third parties for critical components of our infrastructure.\nWe outsource a significant portion of our information systems, communications, data management and transaction processing to third parties. These third parties are sources of risk associated with operational errors, system interruptions or breaches, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and misuse of intellectual property. If the service providers encounter any of these issues, we could be exposed to disruption of service, reputation damages, and litigation risk that could be material to our business.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Stock\nAlthough publicly traded, BOK Financial's common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for a stock quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System.\nA relatively small fraction of BOK Financial's outstanding common stock is actively traded. The risks of low liquidity include increased volatility of the price of BOK Financial's common stock. Low liquidity may also limit holders of BOK Financial's common stock in their ability to sell or transfer BOK Financial's shares at the price, time and quantity desired.\nBOK Financial's principal shareholder controls a majority of BOK Financial's common stock.\nMr. George B. Kaiser owns approximately 55% of the outstanding shares of BOK Financial's common stock at December 31, 2020. Mr. Kaiser is able to elect all of BOK Financial's directors and effectively control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of BOK Financial's common shareholders. Mr. Kaiser's ability to prevent an unsolicited bid for BOK Financial or any other change in control could have an adverse effect on the market price for BOK Financial's common stock. A substantial majority of BOK Financial's directors are not officers or employees of BOK Financial or any of its affiliates. However, because of Mr. Kaiser's control over the election of BOK Financial's directors, he could change the composition of BOK Financial's Board of Directors so that it would not have a majority of outside directors.\nPossible future sales of shares by BOK Financial's principal shareholder could adversely affect the market price of BOK Financial's common stock.\nMr. Kaiser has the right to sell shares of BOK Financial's common stock in compliance with the federal securities laws at any time, or from time to time. The federal securities laws will be the only restrictions on Mr. Kaiser's ability to sell. Because of his current control of BOK Financial, Mr. Kaiser could sell large amounts of his shares of BOK Financial's common stock by causing BOK Financial to file a registration statement that would allow him to sell shares more easily. In addition, Mr. Kaiser could sell his shares of BOK Financial's common stock without registration under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Although BOK Financial can make no predictions as to the effect, if any, that such sales would have on the market price of BOK Financial's common stock, sales of substantial amounts of BOK Financial's common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect market prices. If Mr. Kaiser sells or transfers his shares of BOK Financial's common stock as a block, another person or entity could become BOK Financial's controlling shareholder.\nStatutory restrictions on subsidiary dividends and other distributions and debts of BOK Financial's subsidiaries could limit amounts BOK Financial's subsidiaries may pay to BOK Financial.\nA substantial portion of BOK Financial's cash flow typically comes from dividends paid by BOKF, NA. Statutory provisions and regulations restrict the amount of dividends BOKF, NA may pay to BOK Financial without regulatory approval. Management also developed, and the BOK Financial board of directors approved, an internal capital policy that is more restrictive than the regulatory capital standards. In the event of liquidation, creditors of the subsidiary banks and other non-bank subsidiaries of BOK Financial are entitled to receive distributions from the assets of that subsidiary before BOK Financial, as holder of an equity interest in the subsidiaries, is entitled to receive any distributions.", "PERMNO": 76892, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BOKF"}
