{"cik": "1018963", "company": "ALLEGHENY TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described are not the only risks and uncertainties that could affect our business. See the discussion under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELATED TO CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS\nCyclical Demand for Products. The cyclical nature of the industries in which our customers operate causes demand for our products to be cyclical, creating potential uncertainty regarding future profitability. Various changes in general economic conditions may affect the industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers\u2019 products due to economic downturns. Other factors that may cause fluctuation in our customers\u2019 positions are changes in market demand, lower overall pricing due to domestic and international overcapacity, currency fluctuations, lower priced imports and increases in use or decreases in prices of substitute materials. As a result of these factors, our profitability has been and may in the future be subject to significant fluctuation.\nRisks Associated with the Commercial Aerospace Industry. A significant portion of our sales represent products sold to customers in the commercial aerospace industry. Fulfilling contractual arrangements to provide various products to customers in this industry often involves meeting highly exacting performance requirements and product specifications, and our failure to meet those requirements and specifications on a timely and cost efficient basis could have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations, business and financial condition. The commercial aerospace industry has historically been cyclical due to factors both external and internal to the airline industry. These factors include general economic conditions, airline profitability, consumer demand for air travel, varying fuel and labor costs, changes in projected build rates (including, e.g., the suspension in production of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and the decline in projected build rates for Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner and for other commercial aircraft associated with the global COVID-19 pandemic that is expected to impact the industry for several years), price competition, and international and domestic political conditions such as military conflict and the threat of terrorism. The length and degree of cyclical fluctuation are influenced by these factors and therefore are difficult to predict with certainty. Demand for our products, particularly those produced in our HPMC segment, is subject to these cyclical trends. Cyclical and event-driven downturns in the commercial aerospace industry have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on the prices at which we are able to sell our products, and our results of operations, business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Associated with the Oil & Gas Industry. The oil & gas industry, which historically has been a significant end market for ATI, is highly cyclical and subject to volatility as a result of worldwide economic activity and associated demand for oil and natural gas, anticipated future prices for oil and natural gas, fluctuation in the level of drilling activity, changes in applicable regulation, global geopolitical conditions and numerous other factors. Demand for our products is likewise subject to these trends. In recent years, our business has been negatively impacted by a general downturn and slow recovery in the oil & gas industry, which most recently has been further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s negative effect on global economic activity. We expect that this end market will remain a highly cyclical industry, and future downturns could have an adverse effect on the prices at which we are able to sell our products, and our results of operations, business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nProduct Pricing. From time-to-time, reduced demand, intense competition and excess manufacturing capacity have resulted in reduced prices, excluding raw material surcharges, for many of our products. These factors have had and may have an adverse impact on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. Although inflationary trends in most of the last few years have been moderate, during most of the same period, certain critical raw material costs, such as nickel, titanium sponge, cobalt, chromium, and molybdenum and scrap containing iron, nickel, titanium, chromium, and molybdenum have been volatile. While we have been able to mitigate some of the adverse impact of volatile raw material costs through raw material surcharges or indices to customers, rapid changes in raw material costs causes volatility in, and may adversely affect, our results of operations.\nWe change prices on certain of our products from time-to-time. The ability to implement price increases is dependent on market conditions, economic factors, raw material costs and availability, competitive factors, operating costs and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. The benefits of any price increases may be delayed due to long manufacturing lead times and the terms of existing contracts.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES THAT WE USE\nDependence on Critical Raw Materials Subject to Price and Availability Fluctuations. We rely to a substantial extent on third parties to supply certain raw materials that are critical to the manufacture of our products. Purchase prices and availability of these critical items are subject to volatility. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials on a timely basis, on price and other terms acceptable to us, or at all. If suppliers increase the price of critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. In addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to customers and accepted customer orders for products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, or have existing contracts, we may be unable to raise the price of products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials. The prices for many of the raw materials we use have been volatile during the past several years. Due to the long lead times required to manufacture many of our products, volatility in raw material prices exposes us to cash costs that may not be fully recovered through surcharge and index pricing mechanisms.\nThe manufacture of some of our products is a complex process and requires long lead times. As a result, we may experience delays or shortages in the supply of raw materials. In particular, we acquire certain important raw materials that we use to produce specialty materials, including nickel, zirconium, niobium, chromium, cobalt, vanadium and titanium sponge, from foreign sources. Some of these sources operate in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions. For example, we source both nickel and chromium from Russian sources that could be impacted by current events involving Russia and the Ukraine and any U.S. or other international economic sanctions or other actions in response. These or similar conditions may disrupt supplies or affect the prices of the materials that are necessary to our operations. If unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of products. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions, or suffer harm to our reputation.\nDependence on Critical Supplies Subject to Price and Availability Fluctuations. We rely on third parties for certain supplies, such as graphite electrodes and industrial gases including helium and argon that are critical to the manufacture of our products. Purchase prices and availability of these critical items are subject to volatility. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical supplies on a timely basis, on price and other terms acceptable to us, or at all. If suppliers increase the price of these items, we may not have alternative sources of supply. The manufacture of some of our products is a complex process and requires long lead times. As a result, we may experience delays or shortages of critical supplies. If unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of required supplies, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of products. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions, or suffer harm to our reputation.\nAvailability of Energy Resources. We rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products. The prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the supply of energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture products for customers. Further, increases in energy costs, or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors, has and may continue to adversely affect our profitability. To the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive, increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR WORKFORCE\nRisks Associated with the Recruitment and Retention of Key Talent and the Sustainability of our Workforce. Our business and manufacturing processes are complex. We require highly skilled personnel with relevant industry and technical experience to effectively operate, and as such, depend on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our employees. Shortages in skilled labor and other labor market pressures currently are resulting in greater competition for skilled labor and increased labor costs in some instances. If we fail to attract, develop, retain and motivate a sustainable workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business, our operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the loss of key members of management and other personnel could negatively impact our business, and any unplanned turnover, or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions could result in loss of technical or other expertise or institutional knowledge, delay or impede the execution of our strategic plans and priorities and, ultimately, negatively impact our business and results.\nLabor Matters. We have approximately 6,300 active employees, of which approximately 20% are located outside the United States. Approximately 40% of our workforce is covered by various CBAs, predominantly with the USW. At various times, our CBAs expire and are subject to renegotiation. We currently are involved in negotiations involving CBAs with approximately 800 full-time employees that expire in 2022. Generally, collective bargaining agreements that expire may be terminated after notice by the union. After termination, the union may authorize a strike. A labor dispute, which could lead to a strike, lockout, or other work stoppage by the employees covered by one or more of the collective bargaining agreements, could have a material adverse effect on production at one or more of our facilities and, depending upon the length of such dispute or work stoppage, on our operating results. For example, in 2021, the USW engaged in a 3 \u00bd month strike primarily affecting our AA&S segment operations, and we incurred approximately $63 million in strike-related costs and had lower revenues during this period while we continued to operate affected facilities with replacement workers. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements to replace those that expire.\nRISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY\nRisks Associated with Information Technology. Information technology infrastructure is critical to supporting business objectives; failure of our information technology infrastructure to operate effectively could adversely affect our business. We depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. If a problem occurs that impairs this infrastructure, the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate. As we integrate, implement and deploy new information technology processes and information infrastructure across our operations, we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nCyber Security Threats. Increased global information technology threats, vulnerabilities, and a rise in sophisticated and targeted international computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. We believe that ATI faces the threat of such cyber attacks due to the markets we serve, the products we manufacture, the locations of our operations, and global interest in our technology. These risks may be exacerbated by the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the evolving nature of cyber security threats, the scope and impact of any incident cannot be predicted. We continually work to strengthen our threat countermeasures,\nsafeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks. Despite our efforts to fortify our cyber security and protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches. This could lead to disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, production downtimes, operational disruptions, and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.\nRISK RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nRisks Associated with Climate Change.\nWhile the prospect of a lower-carbon economy presents a number of opportunities for our business, the physical impacts of climate change, regulatory efforts to transition to a lower-carbon economy in the regions in which we, our customers and our suppliers operate and the increased focus and evolving views of our various stakeholders on climate change issues could create risks to our business.\nPhysical Risk. Climate related changes in prevailing weather patterns may impact, among other conditions, changes in sea levels and the propensity for flooding in coastal and other regions, long-term changes in precipitation patterns leading to flooding, drought or deterioration in water quality, and the frequency and severity of significant storms and other weather events and related natural hazards, such as wildfire risk. Although we do not believe that our facilities are currently exposed to significant physical risk as a general matter, our operations have at times been, and could in the future be, impacted by adverse climate-related events, such as, for example, the extreme heat and wide-spread wildfires that negatively impacted the Pacific Northwest region in 2021. Events such as these could cause damage to critical facilities and equipment, result in significant operational disruption and have meaningfully adverse effects on our employees and the communities in which we operate. Additionally, even to the extent that significant weather events or changes in climate conditions do not directly impact our own facilities and/or operations, our business could be negatively impacted by events or more chronic climate conditions that disrupt or force longer-term changes in operations for our significant customers or suppliers, which could negatively impact the timing or overall volume of demand for our products or the cost and availability of critical raw materials, among other factors. Over time, widespread physical climate changes and risks could drive increases in other operational costs for our business, such as insurance costs.\nRegulatory and Other Transition Risks. Increased worldwide focus on climate change has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to combat both potential causes and adverse impacts of climate change. New or more stringent laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions, water usage and other climate change related concerns may adversely affect us, our suppliers and our customers. We have publicly disclosed efforts to reduce the energy intensity, freshwater intake intensity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission of our operations, working consistently to enhance the environmental sustainability of our business by reducing our reliance on fossil fuel-based energy sources, promoting water reuse and other responsible water management practices, reducing waste and promoting recycling (including extensive use of recycled feedstock in our manufacturing processes) and ensuring our compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Notably, our announced exit from the production of standard stainless sheet products is expected to meaningfully reduce our use of some of our most energy-intensive melt operations, potentially driving future reductions in energy intensity and GHG emissions. Nevertheless, new and evolving laws and regulations could mandate different or more restrictive standards, increase operating costs, require (or cause customers to require that we make) capital investments to transition to low carbon technologies or purchase carbon credits, or otherwise adversely impact our ongoing operations. Our suppliers may face similar challenges and incur additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These direct and indirect costs may adversely impact our results.\nMarket and Reputational Risks. Technology to support the transition to lower-carbon operations within the timeframe that could be required by future regulation or expected in the future by our customers may not be available at the scale necessary to support our operations, in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. It is possible that, over time, due to both regulatory action and/or changing customer and societal norms and expectations regarding the causes and importance of climate change issues, demand for products in one or more of our significant end markets could decline or, if we fail to keep pace with changing demand and technological advancement, shift in favor of products that we do not produce. If we fail to appropriately adapt to the expectations of our customers or other stakeholders, fail to achieve or properly report progress toward our environmental sustainability goals and targets or otherwise are perceived as failing to adequately addresses climate change concerns, the resulting negative perceptions could adversely affect our business, reputation and access to capital.\nRisks Associated with Other Environmental Compliance Matters. We are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants and disposal of wastes, and which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. We could incur substantial cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non-compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities. We are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of our current and former\nsites as well as third party sites. We also could be subject to future laws and regulations that govern greenhouse gas emissions and various matters related to climate change and other air emissions, which could increase our operating costs. With respect to proceedings brought under the federal Superfund laws, or similar state statutes, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at approximately 40 of such sites, excluding those at which we believe we have no future liability. Our involvement is limited or de minimis at approximately 20 of these sites, the potential loss exposure with respect to 15 individual sites is not considered to be material, and the potential loss exposure on the remaining 5 sites could be material. We are a party to various cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs at many of the sites. The terms of the cost-sharing arrangements are subject to non-disclosure agreements as confidential information. Nevertheless, the cost-sharing arrangements generally require all PRPs to post financial assurance of the performance of the obligations or to pre-pay into an escrow or trust account their share of anticipated site-related costs. In addition, the Federal government, through various agencies, is a party to several such arrangements.\nWe believe that we operate our businesses in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, from time-to-time, we are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings involving alleged violations of, or liabilities arising from, environmental laws. When our liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate our costs, we record environmental liabilities in our financial statements. In many cases, we are not able to determine whether we are liable or if liability is probable or to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss. Estimates of our liability remain subject to additional uncertainties, including the nature and extent of site contamination, available remediation alternatives, the extent of corrective actions that may be required, and the participation number and financial condition of other PRPs, as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation. We intend to adjust our accruals to reflect new information as appropriate. Future adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period, but we cannot reliably predict the amounts of such future adjustments. At December 31, 2021, our reserves for environmental matters totaled approximately $13 million. Based on currently available information, we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding the amount already accrued for any of the sites with which we are currently associated (either individually or in the aggregate) will be an amount that would be material to a decision to buy or sell our securities. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters, however, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nImpacts on the End-Markets that We Serve and Demand for Our Products. The COVID-19 pandemic, including governmental and other actions taken or restrictions imposed to contain its spread and impact, has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks including, but not limited to, those discussed below.\nThe significant macroeconomic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the measures designed to contain its spread impacted several of the Company\u2019s end markets. Although we are beginning to see improvements in end market demand, we continue to experience lower demand and volume for certain products and services than we generally experienced prior to the onset of the pandemic. Our sales to customers in markets that are affected by COVID-19 have been negatively impacted, and the possibility exists that there could be ongoing impacts to our operations and financial results. For example, a significant portion of our sales represent products sold to customers in the commercial aerospace industry, which in general were significantly impacted by the pandemic and took various measures in response, including efforts to reduce inventory and/or downward adjustments to their stated production rates. As the pandemic subsides and related travel and other restrictions are lifted, we are experiencing improved demand, but demand recovery to pre-pandemic levels may be uneven or generally occur more slowly than anticipated. Similarly, in recent years, our business has at times been negatively impacted by the downturn and slow recovery in the oil & gas industry, including as a result of the pandemic, and the ultimate strength and pace of recovery in the energy industry is uncertain. The ultimate breadth and duration of these trends and their impact on our business is difficult to predict.\nImpacts to Our Supply Chain. To date, we have not experienced significant disruption to our supply chain as a result of the pandemic. However, it remains possible at some point that due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic, one or more of our suppliers may not have the materials, capacity, or capability to supply products that we require according to our schedule and specifications. In that case, we may need to seek alternate suppliers, which may be more expensive, may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us and subsequently to our customers, each of which would affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nRisk of Operational Disruption. In general throughout the pandemic, our facilities continued to operate with federal and state government approvals due to the qualification of our facilities as essential and critical. However, we have experienced and may again in the future experience the temporary shut down of facilities in response to employees being impacted by COVID-19 or changes in government policy.\nImpacts on Financial and Credit Markets. Any continued pandemic-related financial market volatility could pose heightened risks to our liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of funds, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOTHER OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC RISKS\nExport Sales and International Trade Matters. We believe that export sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our future revenues. We also import certain raw materials that are important to our business, including nickel, zirconium, niobium, chromium, cobalt, vanadium and titanium sponge, among others. Risks associated with such international trade include, among others: political and economic instability, including weak conditions in the world\u2019s economies; accounts receivable collection; export controls; trade sanctions; changes in legal and regulatory requirements; policy changes affecting the markets for our products; changes in tax laws; and exchange rate fluctuations (which may affect sales to international customers and the value of profits earned on export sales when converted into dollars). Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our results for the period in which they occur.\nAdditionally, changes in international trade duties and other aspects of international trade policy, both in the U.S. and abroad, could materially impact our business. Moreover, tariffs, or other changes in U.S. trade policy, have resulted in and may continue to trigger, retaliatory actions by affected countries. Certain foreign governments have instituted or considered imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods, or taking action to deny U.S. companies access to critical raw materials, in response to U.S. trade actions. A \u201ctrade war\u201d of this nature or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses.\nPolitical and Social Turmoil. The war on terrorism as well as political and social turmoil could put pressure on economic conditions in the United States and worldwide. These political, social and economic conditions could make it difficult for us, our suppliers, and our customers to forecast accurately and plan future business activities, and could adversely affect the financial condition of our suppliers and customers and affect customer decisions as to the amount and timing of purchases from us. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Associated with Strategic Capital Projects and Maintenance Activities. From time-to-time, we undertake strategic capital projects in order to enhance, expand and/or upgrade our facilities and operational capabilities. Our ability to achieve the anticipated increased revenues or otherwise realize acceptable returns on these investments or other strategic capital projects that we may undertake is subject to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control, including a variety of market, operational, permitting, and labor-related factors. In addition, the cost to implement any given strategic capital project ultimately may prove to be greater than originally anticipated. If we are not able to achieve the anticipated results from the implementation of any of our strategic capital projects, or if we incur unanticipated implementation costs or delays, our results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, we periodically undertake maintenance activities, routine or otherwise, involving facilities and pieces of equipment that are key to our operations, and it is possible that unanticipated maintenance needs, or unanticipated circumstances arising in connection with planned maintenance activities could result in equipment outages that are longer, or costs that exceed, those originally anticipated. Significant repair delays or unanticipated costs associated with these activities could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Associated with Current or Future Litigation and Claims. A number of lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our currently and formerly owned businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, patent infringement, commercial disputes, government contracting, employment matters, employee and retiree benefits, taxes, environmental matters, health and safety and occupational disease, and stockholder and corporate governance matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on all claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face or that additional claims will not be made against us in the future. While the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be determined adversely to us, we do not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period. Also, we can give no assurance that any other claims brought in the future will not have a material effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Insurance Coverage. We have maintained various forms of insurance, including insurance covering claims related to our properties and risks associated with our operations. Our existing property and liability insurance coverages contain exclusions and limitations on coverage. From time-to-time, in connection with renewals of insurance, we have experienced additional exclusions and limitations on coverage, larger self-insured retentions and deductibles, and significantly higher premiums. As a result, in the future our insurance coverage may not cover claims to the extent that it has in\nthe past and the costs that we incur to procure insurance may increase significantly, either of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Acquisition and Disposition Strategies. We intend to continue to strategically position our businesses in order to improve our ability to compete. Strategies we employ to accomplish this may include seeking new or expanding existing specialty market niches for our products, expanding our global presence, acquiring businesses complementary to existing strengths, and continually evaluating the performance and strategic fit of our existing business units. From time-to-time, management holds discussions with management of other companies to explore acquisitions, joint ventures, and other business combination opportunities as well as possible business unit dispositions. As a result, the relative makeup of the businesses comprising our Company is subject to change. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and other business combinations involve various inherent risks, such as: assessing accurately the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition or other transaction candidates; the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business; our ability to achieve identified financial and operating synergies, growth or other benefits anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction; and unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquisition or other transaction. International acquisitions and other transactions could be affected by export controls, exchange rate fluctuations, domestic and foreign political conditions, changes in tax laws and a deterioration in domestic and foreign economic conditions.\nRisks Associated with Government Contracts. Some of our operating units perform contractual work directly or indirectly for the U.S. Government, which requires compliance with laws and regulations relating to the performance of Government contracts. Various claims (whether based on U.S. Government or Company audits and investigations or otherwise) could be asserted against us related to our U.S. Government contract work. Depending on the circumstances and the outcome, such proceedings could result in fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages or the cancellation or suspension of payments under one or more U.S. Government contracts. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or units, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts based on the results of investigations.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INDEBTEDNESS; OTHER FINANCIAL AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING RISKS\nRisks Associated with Indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.8 billion. This substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate enough cash to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders and significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, our strategic growth initiatives and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022restrict us from taking advantage of business opportunities;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.\nIn addition, the agreements that govern our current indebtedness contain, and the agreements that may govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nIn addition, our variable rate indebtedness, including loans outstanding from time to time under our Asset Based Lending (ABL) Credit Facility, may use London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the rate. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. In March 2021, relevant regulators confirmed that the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR would cease after December 31, 2021, and all remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors would cease after June 30, 2023. Our ABL credit facility includes provisions intended to provide for such transitions, but the potential consequences of these changes cannot be fully predicted and could impact the cost of our variable rate indebtedness or the cost or value of\nother financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us from time to time, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nRisks Associated with Retirement Benefits. At December 31, 2021, our defined benefit pension plans were approximately 84% funded as calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As a result of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) enacted in March 2021, the rules governing pension funding calculations changed. Based on current actuarial assumptions, we are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans during fiscal year 2022, and our prior contributions have generated a credit balance that may be utilized to offset future minimum required contributions. We currently expect to make voluntary cash contributions of approximately $50 million to these plans in 2022. Using our long-term weighted average expected rate of return on pension plan assets and other actuarial assumptions, we do not expect to have any minimum cash funding requirements to these pension plans for the next few years after 2022. However, these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty, including the performance of our pension trust assets. Depending on the timing and amount, a requirement that we fund the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nGoodwill or Long-Lived Asset Impairments. We have various long-lived assets that are subject to impairment testing. We review the recoverability of goodwill annually, or more frequently whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded goodwill of a reporting unit may be below that reporting unit\u2019s fair value. Our businesses operate in highly cyclical industries, such as commercial aerospace and oil & gas, and as such, our estimates of future cash flows, market demand, the cost of capital, and forecasted growth rates and other factors may fluctuate, which may lead to changes in estimated fair value and, therefore, impairment charges in future periods. For the 2021 annual goodwill impairment evaluation, both of our reporting units with goodwill had fair values that were in excess of carrying value. Additionally, we have a significant amount of property, plant and equipment and acquired intangible assets that may be subject to impairment testing, depending on factors such as market conditions, the demand for our products, and facility utilization levels. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other long-lived assets has had, and may in the future have, a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with our December 2020 announcements regarding our plans to cease production of certain lower-margin standard stainless sheet products, our 2020 results included $1,041.5 million of long-lived asset non-cash impairment charges, primarily related to our HRPF and certain stainless steel melting and finishing operations that are part of the AA&S segment\u2019s Brackenridge, Pennsylvania operations. We also recognized an interim goodwill impairment charge of $287.0 million in the second quarter of 2020 for the partial impairment of goodwill at our Forged Products reporting unit in the HPMC segment based on changes in the timing and amount of expected cash flows resulting from lower projected revenues, including recent disruptions to the global commercial aerospace market resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increasing uncertainty of near-term demand requirements of aero-engine and airframe markets based on government responses to the pandemic and ongoing interactions with customers.\nInternal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.", "PERMNO": 43123, "SIC": 3350, "TIC": "ATI"}
