RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. This summary is not intended to be complete and should only be read together with the information set forth in \u201cItem 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this report.\nOperational Risks\n\u2022We may not be able to execute our business plan or growth strategy.\n\u2022Our gas distribution and transmission activities, as well as generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks.\n\u2022Failure to adapt to advances in technology and manage the related costs could make us less competitive.\n\u2022Aging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs.\n\u2022Our insurance may not provide protection against all significant losses.\n\u2022The implementation of our electric generation strategy may not achieve intended results.\n\u2022Our capital projects and programs subject us to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks, and are subject to regulatory oversight.\n\u2022Fluctuations in weather, gas and electricity commodity costs, inflation and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating results.\n\u2022Fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs or an inability to obtain an adequate, reliable and cost-effective fuel supply to meet customer demands may have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\u2022Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, and maintain good labor relations, could harm our results of operations.\n\u2022If we cannot effectively manage new initiatives and organizational changes, we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the business and regulatory environment.\n\u2022Actions of activist stockholders could negatively affect our business and stock price and cause us to incur significant expenses.\n\u2022We outsource certain business functions to third-party suppliers and service providers, and substandard performance by those third parties could harm our business, reputation and results of operations.\n\u2022A cyber-attack on any of our or certain third-party technology systems upon which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate and could lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability.\n\u2022Compliance with and changes in cybersecurity requirements have a cost and operational impact on our business.\n\u2022We are exposed to significant reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery, increased litigation and negative public perception.\n\u2022We have continued financial liabilities related to the sale of the Massachusetts Business.\n\u2022The impacts of catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers.\n\u2022The physical impacts of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon future are affecting our business.\n\u2022We are subject to risks associated with the implementation and efforts to achieve our carbon emission reduction goals.\nFinancial, Economic and Market Risks\n\u2022We have substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition.\n\u2022A drop in our credit ratings could adversely impact our cash flows, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity.\n\u2022The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19) has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\n\u2022Adverse economic and market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.\n\u2022Most of our revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews.\n\u2022The actions of regulators and legislators could result in outcomes that may adversely affect our earnings and liquidity.\n\u2022Our business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries.\n\u2022We are exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services, and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements.\n\u2022We are dependent on cash generated by our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations and pay dividends on our stock.\n\u2022The trading prices for our Equity Units are expected to be affected by, among other things, the trading prices of our common stock, the general level of interest rates and our credit quality.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\n\u2022The early settlement right triggered under certain circumstances and the supermajority rights of the mandatory convertible preferred stock following a fundamental change, could discourage a potential acquirer.\n\u2022Our Equity Units and the issuance and sale of common stock in settlement of the purchase contracts and conversion of mandatory convertible preferred stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and will cause dilution to our stockholders.\n\u2022Capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings.\n\u2022Any future impairments of goodwill could result in a significant charge to earnings in a future period and negatively impact our compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements.\n\u2022Changes in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLitigation, Regulatory and Legislative Risks\n\u2022The outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation related to our business operations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\u2022The Greater Lawrence Incident has materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Our settlement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in respect of federal charges in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident may expose us to further penalties, liabilities and private litigation, and may impact our operations.\n\u2022We could be materially adversely affected if we fail to comply with the laws, regulations and tariffs that apply to our businesses.\n\u2022The cost of compliance with environmental laws, and changes to or additions to, or reinterpretations of the laws, could be significant. Liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\u2022Changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes as well as challenges to tax positions could adversely affect our financial results.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe may not be able to execute our business plan or growth strategy, including utility infrastructure investments.\nBusiness or regulatory conditions may result in us not being able to execute our business plan or growth strategy, including identified, planned and other utility infrastructure investments, which includes investments related to natural gas pipeline modernization and investments related to our renewable energy projects and the build-transfer execution goals within our business plan. Our \u201cNiSource Next\u201d initiative, a comprehensive program designed to identify long-term sustainable capability enhancements and cost optimization improvements, has increased the volume and pace of change and may not be effective as it continues. Our customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results. Utility infrastructure investments may not materialize, may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed. Natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and environmentally attractive fuel. Certain environmental activist groups, investors and governmental entities continue to oppose natural gas delivery and infrastructure investments because of perceived environmental impacts associated with the natural gas supply chain and end use. Energy conservation, energy efficiency, distributed generation, energy storage, policies favoring electric heat over gas heat and other factors may reduce demand for natural gas and electricity. In addition, we consider acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, joint ventures and mergers from time to time as we execute on our business plan and growth strategy. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects. Even if our business plan and growth strategy are executed, there is still risk of, among other things, human error in maintenance, installation or operations, shortages or delays in obtaining equipment, and performance below expected levels (in addition to the other risks discussed in this section). We are currently experiencing, and expect to continue to experience, supply chain challenges impacting our ability to obtain materials for our gas and electric projects. Risks to our capital projects is described in a separate risk factor below.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nOur gas distribution and transmission activities, as well as generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, including potential public safety risks.\nOur gas distribution and transmission activities, as well as generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, including, but not limited to, gas leaks and over-pressurization, downed power lines, stray electrical voltage, excavation or vehicular damage to our infrastructure, outages, environmental spills, mechanical problems and other incidents, which could cause substantial financial losses, as demonstrated in part by the Greater Lawrence Incident. We also have distribution propane assets that involve similar risks. In addition, these hazards and risks have resulted and may in the future result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and/or the general public, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm, which in turn could lead to substantial losses for NiSource and its stockholders. The location of pipeline facilities, including regulator stations, liquefied natural gas and underground storage, or generation, transmission, substation and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from such incidents. As with the Greater Lawrence Incident, certain incidents have subjected and may in the future subject us to litigation or administrative or other legal proceedings from time to time, both civil and criminal, which could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against us, be resolved on unfavorable terms, and require us to incur significant operational expenses. The occurrence of incidents has in certain instances adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our reputation, cash flows, financial position and/or results of operations. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.\nFailure to adapt to advances in technology and manage the related costs could make us less competitive and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nA key element of our electric business model includes generating power at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a competitive cost. We continue to research, plan for, and implement new technologies that produce reliable, cost-efficient power or reduce power consumption and improve the impact on the environment. These technologies, many of which NiSource is implementing, include renewable energy, distributed generation, energy storage, and energy efficiency. Advances in technology, changes in laws or regulations (including subsidization) and other alternative methods of producing power could reduce the cost of electric generation from these sources to a level that is competitive with most central station power electric production, causing power sales to decline and the value of our generating facilities to decline. Other new technologies require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive and may result in the obsolescence of certain operating assets.\nOur natural gas business model depends on widespread utilization of natural gas for space heating as a core driver of revenues. Alternative energy sources, new technologies or alternatives to natural gas space heating, including cold climate heat pumps and/or efficiency of other products, could reduce demand and increase customer attrition, which would impact our ability to recover on our investments in our gas distribution assets.\nIn addition, customers are increasingly expecting additional communications, increased access to information, and expanded electronic capabilities regarding their electric and natural gas services, which, in some cases, involves additional investments in technology. We also rely on technology to adequately maintain key business records.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, including environmental impacts associated with our products and services, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. A failure by us to effectively adapt to changes in technology and manage the related costs could harm our ability to remain competitive in the marketplace for our products and services and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe have risks associated with aging electric and gas infrastructure. These risks can be driven by threats such as, but not limited to, electrical faults, mechanical failure, internal corrosion, external corrosion, ground movement and stress corrosion and/or cracking. The age of these assets may result in a need for replacement, a higher level of maintenance costs, or unscheduled outages, despite efforts by us to properly maintain or upgrade these assets through inspection, scheduled maintenance and capital investment. In addition, the nature of the information available on aging infrastructure assets, which in some cases is incomplete, may make the operation of the infrastructure, inspections, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging. Missing or incorrect infrastructure data may lead to (1) difficulty properly locating facilities, which\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\ncan result in excavator damage and operational or emergency response issues, and (2) configuration and control risks associated with the modification of system operating pressures in connection with turning off or turning on service to customers, which can result in unintended outages or operating pressures. Also, additional maintenance and inspections are required in some instances in order to improve infrastructure information and records and address emerging regulatory or risk management requirements, which increases our costs.\nSupply chain issues related to shortages of materials and transportation logistics may lead to delays in the maintenance and replacement of aging infrastructure, which could increase the probability and/or impact of a public safety incident. We lack diversity in suppliers of gas materials. We may not be effective in ensuring that we can obtain adequate emergency supply on a timely basis in each state, that no compromises are being made on quality and that we have alternate suppliers available. The failure to operate our assets as desired could result in interruption of electric service, major component failure at generating facilities and electric substations, gas leaks and other incidents, and an inability to meet firm service and compliance obligations, which could adversely impact revenues, and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs, which, if not fully recovered from customers, could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses.\nOur ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance, are affected by developments affecting our business; international, national, state, or local events; and the financial condition and underwriting considerations of insurers. For example, some insurers are moving away from underwriting certain carbon-intensive energy-related businesses such as those in the coal industry or those exposed to certain perils such as wildfires as well as gas explosion events or other infrastructure-related risks. The utility insurance market continues to be impacted by a prevalence of severe losses, and despite significant increases in rates over the past few years, markets are experiencing unacceptable loss ratios. We have not been able to obtain liability insurance coverage at previously procured limits at rates that are acceptable to us. Capacity limits insurers are willing to issue have decreased, requiring participation from more insurers to provide adequate coverage. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at limits, rates or terms acceptable to us. The premiums we pay for our insurance coverage have significantly increased as a result of market conditions and the accumulated loss ratio over the history of our operations, and we do not expect those costs to decline. In addition, our insurance is not sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we are subject. For example, total expenses related to the Greater Lawrence Incident exceeded the total amount of liability coverage available under our policies. Certain types of damages, expenses or claimed costs, such as fines and penalties, have been and in the future may be excluded under the policies. In addition, insurers providing insurance to us may raise defenses to coverage under the terms and conditions of the respective insurance policies that could result in a denial of coverage or limit the amount of insurance proceeds available to us. Any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\nThe implementation of NIPSCO\u2019s electric generation strategy, including the retirement of its coal generation units, may not achieve intended results.\nOur plan to replace our coal generation capacity by the end of 2028 with primarily renewable resources is well underway. We submitted an Integrated Resource Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) to the IURC, and our Preferred Energy Resource Plan, which refines the timeline to retire the Michigan City Generating Station to occur between 2026 and 2028. We submitted our 2021 Plan to the IURC in November 2021. The 2021 Plan calls for the replacement of the retiring units with a diverse portfolio of resources including demand side management resources, incremental solar, stand-alone energy storage and upgrades to existing facilities at the Sugar Creek Generating Station, among other steps. The precise timing of the retirement will be informed by regulatory and policy changes, our ability to maintain reliability of the system and our ability to secure replacement capacity. For additional information, see \u201cResults and Discussion of Segment Operations - Electric Operations,\u201d in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties in executing the projects associated with the 2018 and 2021 plans both for what has been already executed and what capacity is still planned, including changes in market conditions, supply chain disruptions, regulatory approvals, environmental regulations, commodity costs and customer expectations, which may impede NIPSCO\u2019s ability to achieve the intended results and associated timelines. Changes in the cost, availability and supply of generation capacity may affect the implementation of the results from the 2021 Plan. Advancements in technology in replacement resources may not become commercially available or economically feasible as projected in the 2021 Plan and the implementation execution may vary from that which has been communicated. NIPSCO\u2019s future success will depend, in part, on its ability to successfully implement its long-term electric generation plans, to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nNIPSCO\u2019s electric generation strategy could require significant future capital expenditures, operating costs and charges to earnings that may negatively impact our financial position, financial results and cash flows. An inability to secure and deliver on renewable projects would negatively impact our generation transition timeline, achievement of decarbonization goals and reputation.\nOur capital projects and programs subject us to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks, and are subject to regulatory oversight, including requirements for permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies.\nOur business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in, among other things, capital improvements to our electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, natural gas storage, and other projects, including projects for environmental compliance. We are engaged in intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization programs to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility. NIPSCO also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects, including environmental improvements to its electric generating stations, the construction of new transmission and distribution facilities, and new projects related to renewable energy. As we undertake these projects and programs, we may be unable to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs due in part to shortages in materials as described more fully below. Additionally, we may construct or purchase some of these projects and programs to capture anticipated future growth, which may not materialize, and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time.\nOur existing and planned capital projects require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state, and local governmental agencies. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities, we may be forced to incur additional costs, or we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in a project. We also may not receive the anticipated increases in revenue and cash flows resulting from such projects and programs until after their completion. Other construction risks include changes in the availability and costs of materials, equipment, commodities or labor (including changes to tariffs on materials), delays caused by construction incidents or injuries, work stoppages, shortages in qualified labor, poor initial cost estimates, unforeseen engineering issues, the ability to obtain necessary rights-of-way, easements and transmissions connections and general contractors and subcontractors not performing as required under their contracts.\nWe are monitoring risks related to increasing order and delivery lead times for construction and other materials, increasing risk associated with the unavailability of materials due to global shortages in raw materials and issues with transportation logistics, and risk of decreased construction labor productivity in the event of disruptions in the availability of materials critical to our gas and electric operations. Our efforts to enhance our resiliency to supply chain shortages may not be effective. We are also seeing increasing prices associated with certain materials, equipment and products, which impacts our ability to complete major capital projects at the cost that was planned and approved. To the extent that delays occur or costs increase, customer affordability as well as our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent that delays occur on projects that target system integrity, the risk of an operational incident could increase. For more information on global availability of materials for our renewable projects, see \" - Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - Electric Operations - Electric Supply and Generation Transition.\"\nTo the extent that delays occur, costs become unrecoverable or recovery is delayed, or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of the gas and electricity we sell is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning. Accordingly, fluctuations in weather, gas and electricity commodity costs, inflation and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating results.\nEnergy sales are sensitive to variations in weather. Forecasts of energy sales are based on \u201cnormal\u201d weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal weather resulting from climate change or other factors could have, and have had, a material impact on energy sales. Additionally, residential usage, and to some degree commercial usage, is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity, whereby usage declines with increased costs, thus affecting our financial results. Commodity prices have been increasing. Rising gas costs could heighten regulator and stakeholder sensitivity relative to the impact of base rate increases on customer affordability. Lastly, residential and commercial customers\u2019 usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment, consumption and consumer confidence. Therefore, prevailing economic conditions affecting the demand of our customers may in turn affect our financial results.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nFluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs or an inability to obtain an adequate, reliable and cost-effective fuel supply to meet customer demands may have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur current electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel, and our gas distribution operations purchase and resell a portion of the natural gas we deliver to our customers. These energy commodities are subject to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs. We use physical hedging through the use of storage assets and use financial products in certain jurisdictions in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices. We rely on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in selling energy to our customers. However, while we have historically been successful in the recovery of costs related to such commodity prices, there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner.\nIn addition, we depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets, supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities, and provide retail energy services to our customers. If transportation is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, we may be unable to sell and deliver our gas and electric services to some or all of our customers. As a result, we may be required to procure additional or alternative electricity and/or natural gas supplies at then-current market rates, which, if recovery of related costs is disallowed, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, and maintain good labor relations, could harm our results of operations.\nWe operate in an industry that requires many of our employees and contractors to possess unique technical skill sets. An aging workforce without appropriate replacements, the mismatch of skill sets to future needs, the unavailability of talent for internal positions, and the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs. These operating challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. For example, certain skills, such as those related to construction, maintenance and repair of transmission and distribution systems are in high demand and have a limited supply. Current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us due to market, economic, employment and other conditions, including those related to organizational changes as described in the risk factor below.\nWe face increased competition for talent in the current environment of sustained labor shortage and increased turnover rates. Additionally, any regulatory changes requiring us to enforce a COVID-19 vaccination mandate and how such a mandate is implemented could impact the availability of, and our ability to attract and retain, sufficient qualified employees. We are also facing increasing risk of worker illness and availability due to more contagious COVID-19 variants. These or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant portion of our workforce is subject to collective bargaining agreements, several of which are currently being renegotiated. Our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on an operating company basis with some companies having multiple bargaining agreements, which may span different geographies. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to renegotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. Our workforce continuity plans may not be effective in avoiding work stoppages that may result from labor negotiations or mass resignations. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOur strategic plan includes enhanced technology and transmission and distribution investments and a reduction in reliance on coal-fired generation. As part of our strategic plan, we will need to attract and retain personnel that are qualified to implement our strategy and may need to retrain or re-skill certain employees to support our long-term objectives.\nFailure to hire and retain qualified employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements, safety, service reliability, customer satisfaction and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nIf we cannot effectively manage new initiatives and organizational changes, we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the business and regulatory environment.\nIn order to execute on our sustainable growth strategy and enhance our culture of ongoing continuous improvement, we must effectively manage the complexity and frequency of new initiatives and organizational changes. The organizational changes from the NiSource Next initiative have put short-term pressure on employees due to the volume and pace of change and, in some cases, loss of personnel. Front-line workers are being impacted by the variety of process and technology changes that are currently in progress.\nIf we are unable to make decisions quickly, assess our opportunities and risks, and successfully implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes as needed to execute our strategy in this increasingly dynamic and competitive business and regulatory environment, our financial condition, results of operations and relationships with our business partners, regulators, customers, employees and stockholders may be negatively impacted.\nActions of activist stockholders could negatively affect our business and stock price and cause us to incur significant expenses\nWe may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy or the interests of our other stockholders. We have had communications with an activist stakeholder. Our response to suggested actions, proposals, director nominations and contests for the election of directors activist stockholders could disrupt our business and operations, divert the attention of our board of directors, management and employees, and be costly and time-consuming. Potential actions by activist stockholders or others may interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plans; create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy; cause uncertainty with our regulators; make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel; and adversely affect our relationships with our existing and potential business partners. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to responding to shareholder activism, including for third-party advisors. Moreover, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any stockholder activism.\nWe outsource certain business functions to third-party suppliers and service providers, and substandard performance by those third parties could harm our business, reputation and results of operations.\nUtilities rely on extensive networks of business partners and suppliers to support critical enterprise capabilities across their organizations. Like other companies in the utilities industry, we are seeing slowing deliveries from suppliers and in some cases materials and labor shortages for capital projects. We outsource certain services to third parties in areas including construction services, information technology, materials, fleet, environmental, operational services, corporate and other areas. In addition to delays and unavailability at times, outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to inferior service quality or substandard deliverables, which may result in non-compliance (including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards), interruption of service or accidents, or reputational harm, which could negatively impact our results of operations. We do not have full visibility into our supply chain, which may impact our ability to serve customers in a safe, reliable and cost-effective manner. These risks include the risk of operational failure, reputation damage, disruption due to new supply chain disruptions, exposure to significant commercial losses and fines, and poorly positioned and distressed suppliers. If we continue to see delayed deliveries and shortages or if any other difficulties in the operations of these third-party suppliers and service providers, including their systems, were to occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations, or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators, unions, customers or employees.\nA cyber-attack on any of our or certain third-party technology systems upon which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate and could lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability.\nWe are reliant on technology to run our business, which is dependent upon financial and operational technology systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of our business, including the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity; operation of our gas pipeline facilities; and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators, investors and other stakeholders. In addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face (e.g., ransomware, malware, unauthorized access attempts, phishing attacks, malicious intent by insiders, third-party software vulnerabilities and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information), the utility industry faces evolving and increasingly complex cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer and employee information, electric grid infrastructure, and natural gas infrastructure. Deployment of new business technologies, along with maintaining legacy technology, represents a large-scale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer and employee information, as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure. Increasing\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nlarge-scale corporate attacks in conjunction with more sophisticated threats continue to challenge power and utility companies. Any failure of our technology systems, or those of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could materially disrupt our ability to operate our business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to our reputation.\nAdditionally, our information systems experience ongoing, often sophisticated, cyber-attacks by a variety of sources, including foreign sources, with the apparent aim to breach our cyber-defenses. While we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our information technology, operational technology, and data systems from such attacks, our cybersecurity program does not prevent all breaches or cyberattack incidents. We have experienced an increase in the number of attempts by external parties to access our networks or our company data without authorization. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber intrusions and attacks to our information systems and our operational technology. To our knowledge, none of these intrusions or attacks have resulted in a material cybersecurity intrusion or data breach. The risk of a disruption or breach of our operational technology, or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations, through cybersecurity breach or ransomware attack has increased as attempted attacks have advanced in sophistication and number around the world. Technological complexities combined with advanced cyber-attack techniques, lack of cyber hygiene and human error can result in a cyber incident, such as a ransomware attack. Supplier non-compliance with cyber controls can also result in a cyber incident. Attacks can occur at any point in the supply chain or with any suppliers.\nIn addition, we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, stockholders, and employees. Customers, stockholders, and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.\nAlthough we attempt to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and work through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess our countermeasures, a security breach of our information systems and/or operational technology, or a security breach of the information systems of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could (i) adversely impact our ability to safely and reliably deliver electricity and natural gas to our customers through our generation, transmission and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact our compliance with certain mandatory reliability and gas flow standards, (ii) subject us to reputational and other harm or liabilities associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information, personal or otherwise, relating to our customers or employees, (iii) impact our ability to manage our businesses, and/or (iv) subject us to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims from third parties, in addition to remediation costs, any of which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects. Although we do maintain cyber insurance, it is possible that such insurance will not adequately cover any losses or liabilities we may incur as a result of a cybersecurity incident.\nCompliance with and changes in cybersecurity requirements have a cost and operational impact on our business, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nAs cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated, U.S. government warnings have indicated that critical infrastructure assets, including pipelines and electric infrastructure, may be specifically targeted by certain groups. In 2021, the Transportation Security Administration (\u201cTSA\u201d) announced two new security directives in response to a ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline that occurred earlier in the year. These directives require critical pipeline owners to comply with mandatory reporting measures, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, provide vulnerability assessments, and ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements. Such directives or other requirements may require expenditure of significant additional resources to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance protective measures, or to assess, investigate and remediate any critical infrastructure security vulnerabilities. Any failure to comply with such government regulations or failure in our cybersecurity protective measures may result in enforcement actions that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against threats will be recovered through rates.\nWe are exposed to significant reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery, increased litigation and negative public perception.\nAs a utility company, we are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of our services, the speed with which we are able to respond effectively to electric outages, natural gas leaks or events and related accidents and similar interruptions caused by storm damage, physical or cyber security incidents, or other unanticipated events, as well as our own or third parties' actions or failure to act. We are subject to prevailing labor markets and high attrition, which may impact the speed of our customer service response. We are also facing supply chain challenges, the impacts of which may adversely impact our reputation in\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nseveral areas as described elsewhere in these risk factors. We are also subject to adverse publicity related to actual or perceived environmental impacts. If customers, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us, this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight, increased litigation and negative public perception. The adverse publicity and investigations we experienced as a result of the Greater Lawrence Incident may have an ongoing negative impact on the public\u2019s perception of us. It is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of this adverse publicity. The foregoing may have continuing adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe have continued financial liabilities related to the sale of the Massachusetts Business.\nOn October 9, 2020, we completed the sale of the Massachusetts Business to Eversource. The sale of the Massachusetts Business involves separation or carve-out activities and costs and possible disputes with Eversource. We have continued financial liabilities with respect to the business conducted by Columbia of Massachusetts, as we retain responsibility for, and have agreed to indemnify Eversource against, certain liabilities. This responsibility includes liabilities for any fines arising out of the Greater Lawrence Incident and liabilities of Columbia of Massachusetts or its affiliates pursuant to civil claims for injury of persons or damage to property to the extent such injury or damage occurred prior to the closing in connection with the Massachusetts Business. It may also be difficult to determine whether a claim from a third party is our responsibility, and we may expend substantial resources trying to determine whether we or Eversource has responsibility for the claim.\nThe impacts of natural disasters, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil unrest, cyber-attacks, accidents, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers.\nA disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems, or within electric generation, transmission or distribution systems, in the event of a major hurricane, tornado, terrorist attack, acts of war, civil unrest, cyber-attack (as further detailed above), accident, public health emergency, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. We have experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature. Also, companies in our industry face a heightened risk of exposure to acts of terrorism and vandalism. Our electric and gas physical infrastructure may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt our operations. We have increased security given the current environment and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict. In addition, the supply chain constraints that we are experiencing could impact timely restoration of services. The occurrence of such events could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.\nThe physical impacts of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon future are impacting our business.\nClimate change is exacerbating the risks to our physical infrastructure by increasing the frequency of extreme weather, including heat stresses to power lines and storms and floods that damage infrastructure. In addition, climate change is likely to cause lake and river level changes that affect the manner in which services are currently provided and droughts or other stresses on water used to supply services, and other extreme weather conditions. We have adapted and will continue to evolve our infrastructure and operations to meet current and future needs of our stakeholders. With higher frequency of these and possibly other extreme weather events it may become more costly for us to safely and reliably deliver certain products and services to our customers. Some of these costs may not be recovered. To the extent that we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted. Further, as the intensity and frequency of significant weather events increases, it may impact our ability to secure cost-efficient insurance as described above.\nOur strategy may be impacted by policy and legal, technology, market, and reputational risks and opportunities that are associated with the transition to a lower-carbon economy, as disclosed in other risk factors in this section. As a result of increased awareness regarding climate change, coupled with adverse economic conditions, availability of alternative energy sources, including private solar, microturbines, fuel cells, energy-efficient buildings and energy storage devices, and new regulations restricting emissions, including potential regulations of methane emissions, some consumers and companies may use less energy, meet their own energy needs through alternative energy sources or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services, which may result in, among other things, our generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. Further, evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels could result in a significant impact on our electric generation and natural gas businesses in the future. Conversely, demand for our services may increase as a result of\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\ncustomer changes in response to climate change. For example, as the utilization of electric vehicles increases, demand for electricity may increase, resulting in increased usage of our systems and services. Any negative opinions with respect to our environmental practices or our ability to meet the challenges posed by climate change formed by regulators, customers, investors or legislators could harm our reputation and change the perceived value of our products and services.\nChanges in policy to combat climate change, and technology advancement, each of which can also accelerate the implications of a transition to a lower carbon economy, may materially adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities associated with the implementation and efforts to achieve our carbon emission reduction goals.\nNIPSCO\u2019s electric generation transition is a key element of our goal to achieve a 90% reduction in our Scope 1 GHG emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. Our analysis and plan for execution, which is outlined in the NIPSCO 2021 Integrated Resource Plan, requires us to make a number of assumptions. These goals and underlying assumptions involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees. Should one or more of our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and ability to achieve our emissions goal could differ materially from our expectations. Certain of the assumptions that could impact our ability to meet our emissions goal include, but are not limited to: the accuracy of current emission measurements, service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with expectations; regulatory approval; impacts of future environmental regulations or legislation; impact of future GHG pricing regulations or legislation, including a future carbon tax or methane fee; price, availability and regulation of carbon offsets; price of fuel, such as natural gas; cost of energy generation technologies, such as wind and solar, natural gas and storage solutions; adoption of alternative energy by the public, including adoption of electric vehicles; rate of technology innovation with regards to alternative energy resources; our ability to implement our modernization plans for our pipelines and facilities; the ability to complete and implement generation alternatives to NIPSCO\u2019s coal generation and retirement dates of NIPSCO\u2019s coal facilities by 2030; the ability to construct and/or permit new natural gas pipelines; the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, the lack of scarcity of resources and labor, project cancellations, construction delays or overruns and the ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation; impact of any supply chain disruptions; and enhancement of energy efficiencies. Any negative opinions with respect to these goals or our environmental practices, including any inability to achieve, or a scaling back of these goals, formed by regulators, customers, investors or legislators could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nFINANCIAL, ECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS\nWe have substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur business is capital intensive and we rely significantly on long-term debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations. We had total consolidated indebtedness of $9,801.5 million outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds or increase the cost of borrowing additional funds;\n\u2022reduce the availability of cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022lead parties with whom we do business to require additional credit support, such as letters of credit, in order for us to transact such business;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u2022increase vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022limit our ability to execute on our growth strategy, which is dependent upon access to capital to fund our substantial infrastructure investment program.\nSome of our debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios and cross-default provisions. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations.\nA drop in our credit ratings could adversely impact our cash flows, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nThe availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings. The credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings, taking into account factors such as our capital structure, earnings profile, and, in 2020 and 2021, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings; however, there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future. Our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. Any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive. A negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners, who may be less willing to extend credit or offer us similarly favorable terms as secured in the past under such circumstances.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain \u201cratings triggers\u201d that require increased collateral in the form of cash, a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions if our credit ratings (including the standalone credit ratings of certain of our subsidiaries) are dropped below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of gas or power. As of December 31, 2021, the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $56.2 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain \u201cadequate assurance\u201d or \u201cmaterial adverse change\u201d provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business.\nIf our or certain of our subsidiaries' credit ratings were downgraded, especially below investment grade, financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require additional credit support as described above. Such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Losing investment grade credit ratings may also result in more restrictive covenants and reduced flexibility on repayment terms in debt issuances, lower share price and greater stockholder dilution from common equity issuances, in addition to reputational damage within the investment community.\nThe global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19) has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity, extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, and reduced labor availability and productivity. We continue to monitor how COVID-19 is affecting our workforce, customers, suppliers, operations, financial results and cash flow. The extent of the impact in the future will vary and depend on the duration and severity of the impact on the global, national and local economies.\nOur future operating results and liquidity may continue to be impacted by the pandemic, but the extent of the impact remains uncertain. Primarily in 2020, we experienced lower revenues, higher expenses for personal protective equipment and supplies, and higher bad debt expense as a consequence of the pandemic, which negatively impacted our results of operations. Although our revenues were higher in 2021 compared to 2020, we may continue to experience ongoing impact of the pandemic, which includes, but is not limited to:\n\u2022Lower revenue and cash flow, resulting from the decrease in commercial and industrial gas and electric demand as businesses comply with operating restrictions and/or businesses experience negative economic impact from the pandemic, potentially offset by higher residential demand;\n\u2022Lower revenue and cash flow in the event of the suspension of late payment and reconnection fees in some jurisdictions;\n\u2022A decline in revenue due to an increase in customer attrition rates, as well as lower revenue growth if customer additions slow due to a prolonged economic downturn;\n\u2022A continued increase in bad debt and a decrease in cash flows resulting from the suspension of shut-offs and the inability of our customers to pay for their gas and electric service due to job loss or other factors, partially offset by regulatory deferrals;\n\u2022Lower revenues on a prolonged basis resulting from higher customer bankruptcies, predominately focused on commercial and industrial customers not able to sustain operations through any broader economic downturn;\n\u2022A continued delay in cash flows as more customers utilize the more flexible payment plans we offer; and\n\u2022An increase in internal labor costs from higher overtime.\nWe also face the risk of not achieving operational compliance and/or customer requirements because of work restrictions or unavailable employees due to the pandemic. For more information regarding the items above and additional items related to the pandemic that we are evaluating and monitoring, please see our discussion of these topics in Part II., Item 7. \"Management\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Summary - Introduction - COVID-19\" in this report and in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other Risk Factors described herein.\nThe duration and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity, capital and financing resources, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Such factors and developments may include the geographic spread, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including whether there are periods of increased COVID-19 cases; the further spread of the Delta variant, Omicron variant or the emergence of other new or more contagious variants that may render vaccines ineffective or less effective; disruption to our operations resulting from employee illnesses or any inability to attract, retain or motivate employees; the development, availability and administration of effective treatment or vaccines and the willingness of individuals to receive a vaccine or otherwise comply with various mandates; the extent and duration of the impact on the U.S. or global economy, including the pace and extent of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides; and the actions that have been or may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak.\nAdverse economic and market conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in interest rates or changes in investor sentiment could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.\nDeteriorating, sluggish or volatile economic conditions in our operating jurisdictions could adversely impact our ability to maintain or grow our customer base and collect revenues from customers, which could reduce our revenue or growth rate and increase operating costs. The continued spread of COVID-19 has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity, disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, and reduced labor availability and productivity.\nIn connection with the pandemic, certain state regulatory commissions instituted disconnection moratoriums and the suspension of collection of late payment fees, deposits and reconnection fees, which impacted our ability to pursue our standard credit risk mitigation practices. Following the issuance of these moratoriums, certain of our regulated operations have been authorized to record a regulatory asset for bad debt expense above levels currently in rates. We have reinstated our common credit mitigation practices as moratoriums have expired, but it is possible that such moratoriums will be reinstated as the pandemic continues.\nIn addition, the pandemic has impacted our physical business operations, resulting in delays in conducting certain residential work and additional costs required to comply with pandemic-related health and safety protocols.\nFurther, we rely on access to the capital markets to finance our liquidity and long-term capital requirements, including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements, to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations. We have historically relied on long-term debt and on the issuance of equity securities to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations. Successful implementation of our long-term business strategies, including capital investment, is dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets, including the banking and commercial paper markets, on competitive terms and rates. An economic downturn or uncertainty, market turmoil, changes in interest rates, changes in tax policy, challenges faced by financial institutions, changes in our credit ratings, or a change in investor sentiment toward us or the utilities industry generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt. For example, because NIPSCO\u2019s current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for its operations, certain financial institutions may choose not to participate in our financing arrangements. In addition, large institutional investors may choose to sell or choose not to purchase our stock due to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) concerns or concerns regarding renewable energy supply chain challenges. Reduced access to capital markets, increased borrowing costs, and/or lower equity valuation levels could reduce future earnings per share and cash flows. Refer to Note 15, \u201cLong-Term Debt,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to outstanding long-term debt and maturities of that debt. In addition, any rise in interest rates may lead to higher borrowing costs, which may adversely impact reported earnings, cost of capital and capital holdings.\nIf, in the future, we face limits to the credit and capital markets or experience significant increases in the cost of capital or are unable to access the capital markets, it could limit our ability to implement, or increase the costs of implementing, our business plan, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nMost of our revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings.\nMost of our revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level. As such, the revenues generated by us are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority. These rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues. Our financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs and investments. As described in more detail in the risk factor below, the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain, potentially lengthy and could be influenced by many factors, some of which may be outside of our control, including the cost of providing service, the necessity of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory interpretations, customer intervention, economic conditions and the political environment. Further, the rate orders are subject to appeal, which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates that will ultimately be allowed to be charged for services.\nThe actions of regulators and legislators could result in outcomes that may adversely affect our earnings and liquidity.\nThe rates that our electric and natural gas companies charge their customers are determined by their state regulatory commissions and by the FERC. These commissions also regulate the companies' accounting, operations, the issuance of certain securities and certain other matters. The FERC also regulates the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at wholesale, accounting, issuance of certain securities and certain other matters, including reliability standards through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC).\nUnder state and federal law, our electric and natural gas companies are entitled to charge rates that are sufficient to allow them an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred operating and capital costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, to attract needed capital and maintain their financial integrity, while also protecting relevant public interests. Our electric and natural gas companies are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services. Each of these companies prepares and submits periodic rate filings with their respective regulatory commissions for review and approval, which allows for various entities to challenge our current or future rates, structures or mechanisms and could alter or limit the rates we are allowed to charge our customers. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns. Any change in rates, including changes in allowed rate of return, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings that can be contentious, lengthy, and subject to appeal. This may lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result of those proceedings. Established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, subject to refund or disallowed, including cost recovery mechanisms. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings could have a significant effect on our ability to recover costs or earn an adequate return. Adverse decisions in our proceedings could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that regulators will approve the recovery of all costs incurred by our electric and natural gas companies, including costs for construction, operation and maintenance, and compliance with current and future changes in environmental, federal pipeline safety, critical infrastructure and cyber security laws and regulations. Challenges arise with state regulators on inflationary pricing for electric and gas materials and potential price increases, ensuring that updated pricing for electric and gas materials is included in plans and regulatory assumptions, and ensuring there is a regulatory recovery model for emergency inventory stock. There is debate among state regulators and other stakeholders over how to transition to a decarbonized economy and prudency arguments relative to investing in natural gas assets when the depreciable life of the assets may be shortened due to electrification. The inability to recover a significant amount of operating costs could have an adverse effect on a company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges to rates may occur at times different from when costs are incurred. Additionally, catastrophic events at other utilities could result in our regulators and legislators imposing additional requirements that may lead to additional costs for the companies.\nIn addition to the risk of disallowance of incurred costs, regulators may also impose downward adjustments in a company\u2019s allowed ROE as well as assess penalties and fines. Regulators may reduce ROE to mitigate potential customer bill increases due to items unrelated to capital investments such as potential increases in taxes and incremental costs related to COVID-19. These actions would have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur electric business is subject to mandatory reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards established by NERC and enforced by the FERC. The critical infrastructure protection standards focus on controlling access to critical physical and cybersecurity assets. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards could subject our electric utilities to higher operating costs. In addition, compliance with PHMSA regulations could subject our gas utilities to higher operating costs. If our\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nbusinesses are found to be in noncompliance, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, or damage to our reputation.\nChanges in tax laws, as well as the potential tax effects of business decisions, could negatively impact our business, results of operations (including our expected project returns from our planned renewable energy projects), financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries.\nBusiness operations throughout our service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where our businesses operate. In particular, sales to large industrial customers, such as those in the steel, oil refining, industrial gas and related industries, are impacted by economic downturns, including the downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; geographic or technological shifts in production or production methods; and consumer demand for environmentally friendly products and practices. The U.S. manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, inflation and increasing costs, and fluctuating demand for its products. In addition, our results of operations are negatively impacted by lower revenues resulting from higher bankruptcies, predominately focused on commercial and industrial customers not able to sustain operations through the economic disruptions related to the pandemic.\nWe are exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services, and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements.\nOur extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy, involves considerable judgment by our employees and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty\u2019s financial condition, credit history and other factors. We monitor our credit risk exposure by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers, and by evaluating the financial status of our banking partners and other counterparties by reference to market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. Adverse economic conditions result in an increase in defaults by customers, suppliers and counterparties. As stated above, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, state regulatory moratoriums, which have now expired, impacted our ability to pursue our standard credit risk mitigation practices.\nWe are a holding company and are dependent on cash generated by our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations and pay dividends on our stock.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries, which are separate and distinct legal entities. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to meet our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries. In the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to us, our ability to service our debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected.\nThe trading prices for our Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, and related treasury units and Series C mandatory convertible preferred stock, are expected to be affected by, among other things, the trading prices of our common stock, the general level of interest rates and our credit quality.\nThe trading prices of the Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and the related treasury units and Series C mandatory convertible preferred stock in the secondary market, are expected to be affected by, among other things, the trading prices of our common stock, the general level of interest rates and our credit quality. It is impossible to predict whether the price of our common stock or interest rates will rise or fall. The price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to many events or factors, including those discussed in the risk factors herein, many of which events and factors are beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates may give rise to arbitrage opportunities based upon changes in the relative value of the common stock underlying the purchase contracts and of the other components of the Equity Units. Any such arbitrage could, in turn, affect the trading prices of the Corporate Units, treasury units, mandatory convertible preferred stock and our common stock.\nThe early settlement right triggered under certain circumstances and the supermajority rights of the mandatory convertible preferred stock following a fundamental change, could discourage a potential acquirer.\nThe fundamental change early settlement right with respect to the purchase contracts triggered under certain circumstances by a fundamental change and the supermajority voting rights of the mandatory convertible preferred stock in connection with certain\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nfundamental change transactions jointly could discourage a potential acquirer, including potential acquirers that would otherwise seek a transaction with us that would be attractive to our investors.\nOur Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, and related mandatory convertible preferred stock, and the issuance and sale of common stock in settlement of the purchase contracts and conversion of mandatory convertible preferred stock, may all adversely affect the market price of our common stock and will cause dilution to our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by our Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, and related mandatory convertible preferred stock. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by:\n\u2022investors\u2019 anticipation of the sale into the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock issued upon settlement of the purchase contracts or conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock;\n\u2022possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, or related mandatory convertible preferred stock as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, or related mandatory convertible preferred stock and our common stock.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the effect that future issuances or sales of our common stock, if any, including those made upon the settlement of the purchase contracts or conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock, may have on the market price for our common stock.\nOur Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, and the issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, including issuances and sales upon the settlement of the purchase contracts or conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and will cause dilution to our stockholders.\nCapital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings.\nThe performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts as noted in Note 12, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns, which fall below our projected rates of return. A decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension plan. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, which could potentially increase funding requirements. Further, the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or longer life expectancy assumptions, as well as voluntary early retirements. In addition, lower asset returns result in increased expenses. Ultimately, significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position.\nWe have significant goodwill. Any future impairments of goodwill could result in a significant charge to earnings in a future period and negatively impact our compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and review our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate its fair value might be below its carrying value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment when factors, examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates, a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value, indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nA significant charge in the future could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements. We are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility, which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2021, the ratio was 57.4%.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nChanges in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR. From time to time, we also enter into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate. In addition, these hedging instruments, as well as hedging instruments that our subsidiaries use for hedging natural gas price and basis risk, rely on LIBOR-based rates to calculate interest accrued on certain payments that may be required to be made under these agreements, such as late payments or interest accrued if any cash collateral should be held by a counterparty. Any changes announced by regulators in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported LIBOR rates. If that were to occur, the level of interest payments we incur may change.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency collectively issued a statement encouraging banks to stop entering into financial contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as possible, and no later than December 31, 2021. In March 2021, the FCA announced that 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) LIBOR will cease publication after December 31, 2021, and that the remaining USD LIBOR tenors will cease publication after June 30, 2023. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. On February 18, 2022, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement which, among other things, amended the interest rate provisions applicable to borrowings under this agreement to utilize SOFR as the reference rate, rather than LIBOR. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. However, because SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions, it differs fundamentally from LIBOR. Because of these and other differences, there is no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have performed at any time, and there is no guarantee that it is a comparable substitute for LIBOR.\nIn addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on certain of our obligations if LIBOR is not reported, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with, the interest rates or payments that would have been made on our obligations if a LIBOR-based rate was available in its current form.\nLITIGATION, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE RISKS\nThe outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation related to our business operations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nWe are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation in connection with our business operations, including those related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 19, \u201cOther Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our insurance does not cover all costs and expenses that we have incurred relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident, and may not fully cover incidents that could occur in the future. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcomes of such matters, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nThe Greater Lawrence Incident has materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident, we have incurred and will incur various costs and expenses. While we have recovered the full amount of our liability insurance coverage available under our policies, total expenses related to the incident exceeded such amount. Expenses in excess of our liability insurance coverage have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. We may also incur additional costs associated with the Greater Lawrence Incident, beyond the amount currently anticipated, including in connection with civil litigation. Further, state or federal legislation may be enacted that would require us to incur additional costs by mandating various changes, including changes to our operating practice standards for natural gas distribution operations and safety. In\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\naddition, if it is determined in other matters that we did not comply with applicable statutes, regulations or rules in connection with the operations or maintenance of our natural gas system, and we are ordered to pay additional amounts in penalties, or other amounts, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur settlement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in respect of federal charges in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident may expose us to further penalties, liabilities and private litigation, and may impact our operations.\nOn February 26, 2020, the Company entered into a DPA and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into a plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office to resolve the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s investigation relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident, which was subsequently approved by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the \"Court\"). The agreements impose various compliance and remedial obligations on the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts. Failure to comply with the terms of these agreements could result in further enforcement action by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, expose the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts to penalties, financial or otherwise, and subject the Company to further private litigation, each of which could impact our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, tariffs and policies. We could be materially adversely affected if we fail to comply with such laws, regulations, tariffs and policies or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws, regulations, tariffs and policies.\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, tariffs and policies, including, but not limited to, those relating to natural gas pipeline safety, employee safety, the environment and our energy infrastructure. In particular, we are subject to significant federal, state and local regulations applicable to utility companies, including regulations by the various utility commissions in the states where we serve customers. These regulations significantly influence our operating environment, may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers, and cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs. Existing laws, regulations, tariffs and policies may be revised or become subject to new interpretations, and new laws, regulations, tariffs and policies may be adopted or become applicable to us and our operations. In some cases, compliance with new laws, regulations, tariffs and policies increases our costs. Supply chain constraints may challenge our ability to remain in compliance if we cannot obtain the materials that we need to operate our business in a compliant manner. If we fail to comply with laws, regulations and tariffs applicable to us or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws, regulations, tariffs or policies, our financial condition, results of operations, regulatory outcomes and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws. The cost of compliance with these laws, and changes to or additions to, or reinterpretations of the laws, could be significant. Liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate, among other things, air emissions, water usage and discharges, GHG and waste products such as coal combustion residuals. Compliance with these legal obligations require us to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, remediation, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at many of our facilities. These expenditures are significant, and we expect that they will continue to be significant in the future. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or are found to have caused damage to the environment or persons, that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us, injunctions to remedy the failure or harm, and the inability to operate facilities as designed.\nExisting environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to change environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to us, with an increasing focus on both coal and natural gas. Revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on our facilities or increased compliance costs, which may not be fully recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could, therefore, impact our financial position, financial results and cash flow. Moreover, such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of our facilities.\nAn area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of GHG. While we continue to reduce GHG emissions through the retirement of coal-fired electric generation, increased sourcing of renewable energy, priority pipeline replacement, energy efficiency programs, and leak detection and repair, GHG emissions are currently an expected aspect of the electric and natural gas business. Revised or additional future GHG legislation and/or regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction, production, distribution, transmission, storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply, financial position, financial results and cash flows.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNISOURCE INC.\nEven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated, the original cost estimates for environmental improvements, remediation of past environmental impact, or pollution reduction strategies and equipment can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended. The actual future expenditures depend on many factors, including the nature and extent of impact, the method of improvement, the cost of raw materials, contractor costs, and requirements established by environmental authorities. Changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect our financial position, financial results and cash flows.\nChanges in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes as well as challenges to tax positions could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels where we do business. Legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities. For example, the TCJA includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including changes to U.S. corporate tax rates, business-related exclusions, deductions and credits. The outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the extent to which the effect of a change in corporate tax rate will impact customers and the time period over which the impact will occur could significantly impact future earnings and cash flows. Separately, a challenge by a taxing authority, changes in taxing authorities\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a deviation from other tax-related assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates.", "PERMNO": 38762, "SIC": 4932, "TIC": "NI"}
