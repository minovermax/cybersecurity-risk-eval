{"cik": "808461", "company": "GCI LIBERTY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only ones that relate to the Company's businesses or its capitalization. The risks described below are considered to be the most material. However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on the Company's businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below were to occur, the Company's businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFactors Relating to the Company's Corporate History and Structure\nGCI Liberty conducts its operations to maintain an exclusion from the definition of an \"investment company\" under the 40 Act (as defined below), but nevertheless, may become subject to the 40 Act.\nGCI Liberty is in the business of selling communications and entertainment services to subscribers, and its economic success is based on its ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers. Further, the GCI Holdings operating subsidiaries currently generate substantially all of the cash flow of the consolidated GCI Liberty. GCI Liberty intends to continue to conduct its operations so that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the \u201c40 Act\u201d). To ensure that GCI Liberty does not become subject to regulation under the 40 Act, GCI Liberty may be limited in the type of assets that it may continue to own or acquire and, further, may need to dispose of or acquire certain assets (through a purchase, sale, merger or other transaction) at such times or on such terms as may be less favorable to GCI Liberty than if it were not required to enter into such transaction to maintain its exclusion from regulation under the 40 Act. If for any reason, however, GCI Liberty were to become subject to regulation under the 40 Act (such as due to significant accretion in the value of its interests in certain investment securities coupled with a reduction in the value of the GCI Holdings operations or a change in circumstance which results in a reclassification of certain of its operating assets as investment securities for purposes of the 40 Act), after giving effect to any applicable grace periods, GCI Liberty may be required to register as an investment company, which could result in significant registration and compliance costs, could require changes to its corporate governance structure and financial reporting, and could restrict its activities going forward. In addition, if GCI Liberty were to become inadvertently subject to the 40 Act, any violation of the 40 Act could subject it to material adverse consequences, including potentially significant regulatory penalties and the possibility that certain of its contracts could be deemed unenforceable.\nI-14\nFactors Relating to the Transactions\nThe Company may have a significant indemnity obligation to Qurate Retail if the GCI Liberty Split-Off is treated as a taxable transaction.\nIn connection with the contribution and Holdco Split-Off (together, the \u201cGCI Liberty Split-Off\u201d), Qurate Retail received an opinion of its tax counsel to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the GCI Liberty Split-Off will qualify as a tax-free transaction to Qurate Retail and to the former holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). In July 2018, the IRS completed its review of the GCI Liberty Split-Off and informed Qurate Retail that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transactions. Qurate Retail received an Issue Resolution Agreement from the IRS documenting this conclusion.\nEven if the GCI Liberty Split-Off otherwise qualifies under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D), and related provisions of the Code, the GCI Liberty Split-Off would result in a significant U.S. federal income tax liability to Qurate Retail (but not to the former holders of Liberty Ventures common stock) under Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50% or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in the stock of Qurate Retail or in the stock of the Company (excluding, for this purpose, acquisitions of its common stock meeting statutory exceptions) as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the GCI Liberty Split-Off. Any acquisition of the stock of Qurate Retail or the Company (or any successor corporation) within two years before or after the GCI Liberty Split-Off would generally be presumed to be part of a plan that includes the GCI Liberty Split-Off, although the parties may be able to rebut that presumption under certain circumstances. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel described above, Qurate Retail or the Company might inadvertently cause or permit a prohibited change in ownership of Qurate Retail or the Company, thereby triggering tax liability to Qurate Retail.\nPrior to the GCI Liberty Split-Off, the Company entered into a tax sharing agreement with Qurate Retail. Under this agreement, Qurate Retail is generally responsible for any taxes and losses resulting from the failure of the GCI Liberty Split-Off to qualify as a tax-free transaction; however, the Company is required to indemnify Qurate Retail, its subsidiaries and certain related persons for any taxes and losses which (i) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by the Company (applicable to actions or failures to act by the Company and its subsidiaries following the completion of the GCI Liberty Split-Off), or (ii) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the GCI Liberty Split-Off as a result of the treatment of the GCI Liberty Split-Off as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50% or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in the stock of the Company (or any successor corporation). The Company's indemnification obligations to Qurate Retail, its subsidiaries, and certain related persons are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. If the Company is required to indemnify Qurate Retail, its subsidiaries, or such related persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement, the Company may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect its financial position.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the GCI Liberty Split-Off, the Company may determine to forgo certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to it, including certain asset dispositions or other strategic transactions for some period of time following the GCI Liberty Split-Off. In addition, the Company's indemnity obligation related to the GCI Liberty Split-Off under the tax sharing agreement might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control transaction for some period of time following the GCI Liberty Split-Off.\nThe Company has overlapping directors and management with Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc., which may lead to conflicting interests.\nAs a result of the Transactions and other transactions between 2011 and 2016 that resulted in the separate corporate existence of Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (\u201cLiberty TripAdvisor\u201d), most of the executive officers of GCI Liberty also serve as executive officers of Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty TripAdvisor and Liberty Broadband, and there are overlapping directors. With the exception of the Company\u2019s ownership of shares of Liberty Broadband's non-voting Series C common stock, none of these companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. The Company's executive officers and members of its board of directors have fiduciary duties to its shareholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband or Liberty TripAdvisor have fiduciary duties to that company's stockholders. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband, Liberty TripAdvisor or GCI Liberty looks at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or\nI-15\nthe appearance of conflicts of interest in the event there are matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Moreover, most of the Company\u2019s directors and officers own GCI Liberty stock and equity awards and own Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor stock and equity awards. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Any potential conflict that qualifies as a \u201crelated party transaction\u201d (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer's board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Each of Liberty Broadband, Liberty TripAdvisor and GCI Liberty has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities, and their respective certificate of incorporation provides that no director or officer of the respective company will breach their fiduciary duty and therefore be liable to the respective company or its stockholders by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband, Liberty TripAdvisor and GCI Liberty, as the case may be) instead of the respective company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to the respective company, unless (x) such opportunity was expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the respective company or as a director or officer of any of the respective company\u2019s subsidiaries, and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of business in which the respective company or any of its subsidiaries is then directly engaged. Any other potential conflicts that may arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, GCI Liberty may enter into transactions with Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor and/or their respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transaction will be as favorable to GCI Liberty, Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband and Liberty TripAdvisor or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nThe market value of GCI Liberty's interests in publicly-traded securities may be affected by market conditions beyond its control that could cause it to record losses for declines in such market value.\nAs of December 31, 2019, GCI Liberty's assets included shares of Charter valued at approximately $2.6 billion and shares of Liberty Broadband, which is Charter's largest shareholder with a 25.01% voting interest in Charter, valued at approximately $5.4 billion. The Company has no ability to exercise control over either Charter or Liberty Broadband, and therefore it cannot cause either investee to take actions which may be in the best interest of the Company and its investment in these companies. Although many of the risks described below relating to the Company's operating business similarly affect Charter and Liberty Broadband, for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties specific to Charter and Liberty Broadband, holders of GCI Liberty securities should please see \u201cPart I-Item 1A. Risk Factors-Factors Relating to Our Corporate History and Structure\u201d and \u201cPart I-Item 1A. Risk Factors-Factors Relating to Charter\u201d of Liberty Broadband's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 3, 2020. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, GCI Liberty's assets included an interest in the publicly traded equity of LendingTree with a market value of approximately $1,045.0 million. The value of these interests may be affected by economic and market conditions that are beyond the Company's control, and its ability to liquidate or otherwise monetize these interests without adversely affecting their value may be limited.\nFactors Relating to the Company's GCI Holdings' Business and Future Results\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that it currently deems to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect the business operations of GCI Holdings, which the Company refers to as \"GCI\" in the following risk factors relating to the business of GCI Holdings. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nGCI faces competition that may reduce the Company's market share and harm its financial performance.\nThere is substantial competition in the telecommunications and entertainment industries. Through mergers, various service integration strategies, and business alliances, major providers are striving to strengthen their competitive positions. GCI faces increased wireless services competition from national carriers in the Alaska market and increasing video services competition from DBS providers and over-the-top content providers who are often able to offer more flexible subscription packages and exclusive content.\nThe Company expects competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products. The Company cannot predict which of many possible future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain GCI\u2019s competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services. GCI\u2019s ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on its ability to anticipate and respond to\nI-16\nvarious competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors. To the extent GCI does not keep pace with technological advances or fails to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in its industry and in its markets, GCI could lose market share or experience a decline in its revenue and net income. Competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services. Competitive pressures also create challenges for its ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute its business plan. GCI also faces the risk of potential price cuts by the Company's competitors that could materially adversely affect its market share and gross margins.\nGCI\u2019s wholesale customers including its major roaming customers may construct facilities in locations where they currently contract with GCI to use its network to provide service on their behalf. The Company could experience a decline in revenue and net income if any of GCI\u2019s wholesale customers constructed or expanded their existing networks in places where service is currently provided by GCI\u2019s network. Some of GCI\u2019s wholesale customers have greater access to financial, technical, and other resources than GCI does. GCI expects to continue to offer competitive alternatives to such customers in order to retain significant traffic on GCI's network. The Company cannot predict whether such customers will continue to see GCI's network as a compelling alternative. GCI\u2019s inability to negotiate renewals of such contracts could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf GCI experiences low or negative rates of subscriber acquisition or high rates of turnover, the Company's financial performance will be impaired.\nGCI is in the business of selling communications and entertainment services to subscribers, and its economic success is based on its ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers. In recent years, GCI has seen a general decrease in subscriber metrics. If GCI is unable to retain and attract subscribers, its and the Company's financial performance will be impaired. GCI\u2019s rates of subscriber acquisition and turnover are affected by a number of competitive factors including the size of its service areas, network performance and reliability issues, its device and service offerings, subscribers\u2019 perceptions of its services, and customer care quality. Managing these factors and subscribers\u2019 expectations is essential in attracting and retaining subscribers. Although GCI has implemented programs to attract new subscribers and address subscriber turnover, the Company cannot assure you that these programs or GCI\u2019s strategies to address subscriber acquisition and turnover will be successful. A high rate of turnover or low or negative rate of new subscriber acquisition would reduce revenue and increase the total marketing expenditures required to attract the minimum number of subscribers required to sustain GCI\u2019s business plan which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGCI may be unable to obtain or maintain the roaming services it needs from other carriers to remain competitive.\nSome of GCI\u2019s competitors have national networks that enable them to offer nationwide coverage to their subscribers at a lower cost than GCI can offer. The networks GCI operates do not, by themselves, provide national coverage and GCI must pay fees to other carriers who provide roaming services to it. GCI currently relies on roaming agreements with several carriers for the majority of its roaming services.\nThe FCC requires commercial mobile radio service providers to provide roaming, upon request, for voice and SMS text messaging services on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The FCC also requires carriers to offer data roaming services. The rules do not provide or mandate any specific mechanism for determining the reasonableness of roaming rates for voice, SMS text messaging or data services and require that roaming complaints be resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on a non-exclusive list of factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of particular conduct or rates. If GCI were to lose the benefit of one or more key roaming or wholesale agreements unexpectedly, it may be unable to obtain similar replacement agreements and as a result may be unable to continue providing nationwide voice and data roaming services for its customers or may be unable to provide such services on a cost-effective basis. GCI\u2019s inability to obtain new or replacement roaming services on a cost-effective basis may limit its ability to compete effectively for wireless customers, which may increase its turnover and decrease its revenue, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGCI\u2019s business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation. Changes to or interpretations of existing statutes, rules, regulations, or the adoption of new ones, could adversely affect GCI's business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nAs described above in \u201cItem 1. - Business - Regulatory Matters,\u201d GCI\u2019s business is subject to extensive federal and state governmental legislation and regulation. There can be no assurance that future changes or additions to the regulatory system under which GCI operates will benefit or have no effect on GCI. Similarly, these rules and regulations are subject to\nI-17\ninterpretation by the applicable agencies, and new interpretations, or those of which GCI is not aware, could impact GCI\u2019s operations and have an adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business, position, results of operations or liquidity. There can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by Congress, the FCC or other federal, state or local government authorities will not have a similar effect.\nWith respect to wireless services provided by GCI, the licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC grants wireless licenses and imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum. There can be no guarantee that GCI\u2019s existing licenses will be renewed. In addition, while the FCC does not currently regulate wireless service providers' rates, states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and consumer-related issues. These regulations could increase the costs of GCI\u2019s wireless operations, including with respect to the maintenance of existing licenses granted by the FCC due to failure to comply with applicable regulations. GCI is also subject to FCC rules relating to E911 capabilities, and failure to comply with these rules could subject GCI to significant fines. With respect to video services provided by GCI, GCI is subject to changes in regulation that could potentially result in rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees in the future.\nWith respect to Internet services provided by GCI, GCI is impacted by efforts to reclassify Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. In 2015, the FCC classified Internet service as a telecommunication service. The FCC's implementing regulations prohibited broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic, and from unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging end users' and edge providers' ability to send traffic to, from, and among each other. Although a 2018 FCC order returned to a Title I classification of Internet service and eliminated many of the requirements imposed in its initial 2015 order, there are various efforts in Congress and through state legislation to re-impose net neutrality requirements or some variation thereof. The Company cannot predict whether the FCC or Congress will re-impose the 2015 rules or some variation thereof. The increased regulatory burden if the 2015 rules are re-imposed likely would increase GCI's costs and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing service, which could have a material adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\nUSF receivables and contributions are subject to change due to regulatory actions taken by the FCC, including the FCC's interpretations of the USF program rules, or legislative actions that change the rules and regulations governing the USF program.\nGCI participates in various USF programs, which provide government subsidies to customers in low income areas, including schools, libraries and other facilities. This support was 24% and 23% of the Company's revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the period following the date of the Transactions through December 31, 2018, respectively. GCI had USF net receivables of $151.2 million and $91.3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, the USF programs generally require the Company and other telecommunications providers to make contributions, based on certain revenue earned, into a fund used to subsidize the provision of voice services and broadband-capable voice networks in high-cost areas, the provision of voice and broadband services to low-income consumers, and the provision of internet, voice and telecommunications services to schools, libraries and certain health care providers. The USF programs in which the Company participates are highly regulated. While the rules and regulations governing the USF programs are fairly robust, there can be no assurance that any new rules or regulations adopted will not impact GCI's USF program anticipated receivables or contributions. Further, the FCC and USAC may interpret or apply the applicable rules and regulations in ways that are unexpected to GCI or other program participants. As a result, material changes to receivables and contributions may occur, which could have an adverse effect on GCI's business and the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity. As described above in \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulatory Matters,\u201d GCI has experienced material changes to receivables and contributions from the USF programs in recent years. For example, in October 2018, the Bureau notified GCI of its decision to reduce rural rates charged to RHC customers for the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018 by approximately 26% resulting in a reduction of total support payments of $27.8 million, and stated that it would apply the same cost methodology going forward. In addition, although the FCC has recently adjusted the RHC Program funding cap and committed to annual adjustments in future years for inflation, there is no guarantee that aggregate funding will be available to pay in full the approved funding for future years. Furthermore, the FCC has adopted changes to the manner in which support issued under the RHC Program will be calculated and approved, and GCI is currently unable to assess the substance, impact on funding or timing of these changes.\nI-18\nFailure to comply with USF program requirements may have an adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business and the Company\u2019s financial position.\nThe USF programs in which GCI participates are highly regulated, and, in many cases, require highly technical and nuanced processes and procedures in order to obtain funding and to ensure compliance with the USF programs. For example, telecommunication providers and their customers are subject to regulations that set forth requisite procedures that must be followed by both the provider and the customer, and there are limitations on communications between these parties. If a customer or a provider is found to have not complied with any aspect of these regulations, regardless of whether such noncompliance was unintentional or accidental, the FCC may deny funding and/or require disgorgement of any amounts received under the affected contracts. The FCC may also invalidate any affected contract and impose fines or penalties. Accordingly, failure to comply with these rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on GCI's business and the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity. As described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accrued a loss of approximately $17 million resulting from a review of certain active and expired RHC Program contracts where it has identified potential compliance issues. Although the FCC has been made aware of the potential RHC Program compliance issues, there can be no assurance that the FCC will not impose penalties or fines that would be additive to any required disgorgement or denial of funding. Further, no assurance can be given that any novated contracts will be replicated subsequently, which may affect future revenue.\nLoss of GCI\u2019s ETC status would disqualify it for USF support.\nThe USF pays support to ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline and wireless telephone service in high cost areas. If GCI were to lose its ETC status in any of the study areas where it is currently an authorized ETC whether due to legislative or regulatory reform or its failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, GCI would be ineligible to receive high cost or low income USF support for providing service in that area, which would have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nGCI may not meet its performance plan milestones under the Alaska High Cost Order.\nAs an ETC, GCI receives support from the USF to support the provision of wireline local access and wireless service in high cost areas. On August 31, 2016, the FCC published the Alaska High Cost Order which requires GCI to submit to the FCC a performance plan with five-year and ten-year commitments. If GCI is unable to meet the final performance plan milestones approved by the FCC it will be required to repay 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received over the ten-year term for the relevant number of locations that GCI failed to deploy to, plus ten percent of its total Alaska High Cost Order support received over the ten-year term. Inability to meet GCI\u2019s performance plan milestones could have an adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nGCI may lose USF high cost support if another carrier adds 4G LTE service in an area where it currently provides 4G LTE service.\nUnder the Alaska High Cost Order, the FCC adopted a process for revisiting after five years whether and to what extent there is duplicative support for 4G LTE service in rural Alaska and to take steps to eliminate such duplicative support levels in the second half of the ten-year term. As a result, if another carrier builds 4G LTE service in an area where GCI is the sole provider and the FCC decides to redistribute the support then GCI\u2019s high cost support may be reduced, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nProgramming expenses for GCI\u2019s video services are increasing, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\nThe Company expects programming expenses for GCI\u2019s video services to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming and costs to retransmit local broadcast stations. As GCI\u2019s contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case GCI may be unable to provide such content as part of its video services and the Company's business could be adversely affected. If GCI adds programming to its video services or if GCI chooses to distribute existing programming to its customers through additional delivery platforms, GCI may incur increased programming expenses. If GCI is unable to raise its customers\u2019 rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nI-19\nThe decline in GCI\u2019s voice services\u2019 results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, may accelerate.\nThe Company expects GCI\u2019s voice services\u2019 results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, will continue to decline. As competition from wireless carriers, such as GCI, increases the Company expects GCI\u2019s long-distance and local access services' subscribers and revenue will continue to decline and the rate of decline may accelerate.\nIn addition, GCI\u2019s success in the local telephone market depends on its continued ability to obtain interconnection, access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services. GCI\u2019s ability to provide service in the local telephone market depends on its negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier\u2019s existing local telephone network (in some Alaska markets at cost-based rates), to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way, to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier, and in some cases, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to certain unbundled network elements. Future negotiations or arbitration proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in GCI\u2019s cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers or via wholesale offerings. GCI\u2019s local telephone services business faces the risk of unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations.\nFailure to stay abreast of new technology could affect GCI\u2019s ability to compete in the industry.\nGCI tests and deploys various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance its competitiveness and increase the utility of its services. As GCI\u2019s operations grow in size and scope, it must continuously improve and upgrade its systems and infrastructure while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of its systems and infrastructure. The emergence of alternative platforms such as mobile or tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology. Further, current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability, and the Company expects other advances in communications technology to occur in the future. GCI may not successfully complete the rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner, and they may not be widely accepted by GCI\u2019s customers or may not be profitable, in which case GCI could not recover its investment in the technology. There can be no assurance that GCI will be able to compete with advancing technology or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as it would like or in a cost effective manner. Deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of its networks with respect to both the new and existing services. Any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect GCI\u2019s ability to retain customers and may have an adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, GCI must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If GCI is unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, GCI could experience reduced profits.\nGCI\u2019s operations are geographically concentrated in Alaska and are impacted by the economic conditions in Alaska.\nGCI offers products and services to customers primarily throughout Alaska. Because of this geographic concentration, growth of GCI\u2019s business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska. The economy of Alaska is dependent upon the oil industry, state government spending, United States military spending, investment earnings and tourism. Prolonged periods of low oil prices adversely impacts the Alaska economy, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the demand for GCI\u2019s products and services and on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Low oil prices have put significant pressure on the Alaska state government budget since the majority of its revenue come from the oil industry. While the Alaska state government has significant reserves that the Company believes could help fund the state government, budgetary reforms will need to be implemented in order to offset the impact of lower oil prices.\nThe Alaska economy was in a recession from late 2015 to 2019, and lingering effects of that recession remain present in the Alaska economy. Further, the Alaska economy may experience another recession in the future. While it is difficult for the Company to predict the future impact of the recent recession, the current period of slow growth or any future recession on GCI\u2019s business, these conditions have had, or could have, an adverse impact on GCI\u2019s business and could adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of its products and services and cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of its products and services. Additionally, GCI's customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to GCI. If that were to occur, the Company could be required to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for its accounts receivable could increase. If the lingering effects of that recession continues, the Alaska economy does not resume normal levels of growth or the Alaska economy experiences another recession, it could negatively affect GCI\u2019s business including the Company's financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as its ability to service debt, pay other obligations and\nI-20\nenhance shareholder returns.\nThe customer base in Alaska is limited and GCI has already achieved significant market penetration with respect to its service offerings in Anchorage and other locations in Alaska. GCI may not be able to continue to increase its share of the existing markets for its services, and no assurance can be given that the Alaskan economy will grow and increase the size of the markets GCI serves or increase the demand for the services it offers. The markets in Alaska for wireless and wireline telecommunications and video services are unique and distinct within the United States due to Alaska\u2019s large geographical size, its sparse population located in a limited number of clusters, and its distance from the rest of the United States. The expertise GCI has developed in operating its businesses in Alaska may not provide GCI with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets.\nNatural or man-made disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business.\nGCI\u2019s technical infrastructure (including the Company's communications network infrastructure and ancillary functions supporting its network such as service activation, billing and customer care) is vulnerable to damage or interruption from technology failures, power surges or outages, natural disasters, fires, human error, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing or similar events. As a communications provider, there is an increased risk that GCI\u2019s technological infrastructure may be targeted in connection with terrorism or cyberattacks, either as a primary target, or as a means of facilitating additional attacks on other targets.\nIn addition, earthquakes, floods, fires and other unforeseen natural disasters or events could materially disrupt GCI\u2019s business operations or its provision of service in one or more markets. Specifically, the majority of GCI\u2019s facilities are located in areas with known significant seismic activity. Costs GCI incurs to restore, repair or replace its network or technical infrastructure, as well as costs associated with detecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use, may be substantial and increase GCI\u2019s cost of providing service. Many of the areas in which GCI operates have limited emergency response services and may be difficult to reach in an emergency situation. Should a natural disaster or other event occur, it could be weeks or longer before remediation efforts could be implemented, if they could be implemented at all. Further, any failure in or interruption of systems that GCI or third parties maintain to support ancillary functions, such as billing, point of sale, inventory management, customer care and financial reporting, could materially impact GCI\u2019s ability to timely and accurately record, process and report information important to the Company's business. If any of the above events were to occur, GCI could experience higher churn, reduced revenue and increased costs, any of which could harm its reputation and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, the Company's insurance may not be adequate to cover the costs associated with a natural disaster or terrorist attack.\nCyberattacks or other network disruptions could have an adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business.\nThrough the Company's operations, sales and marketing activities, it collects and stores certain non-public personal information related to its customers. The Company also gathers and retains information about employees in the normal course of business. The Company may share information about such persons with vendors, contractors and other third-parties that assist with certain aspects of its business. In addition, the Company's operations depend upon the transmission of information over the Internet. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to the Company or its vendors\u2019 computer systems by, among other things, hacking into its systems or those of third parties, through fraud or other means of deceiving the Company's employees or its vendors, burglaries, errors by the Company or its vendors\u2019 employees, misappropriation of data by employees, or other irregularities that may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to its data. The techniques used to gain such access to the Company's or its vendors\u2019 technology systems, data or customer information, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target.\nCyberattacks against GCI\u2019s or the Company's vendors' technological infrastructure or breaches of network information technology may cause equipment failures, disruption of its or their operations, and potentially unauthorized access to confidential customer or employee data, which could subject the Company to increased costs and other liabilities as discussed further below. Cyberattacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for service disruption or unauthorized access to confidential customer or employee data, have increased in frequency, scope, and potential harm for businesses in recent years. It is possible for such cyberattacks to go undetected for an extended period of time, increasing the potential harm to GCI\u2019s customers, employees, assets, and reputation.\nI-21\nTo date, GCI has not been subject to cyberattacks or network disruptions that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to GCI\u2019s operations or financial condition. Although GCI has not detected a material security breach or cybersecurity incident to date, it has been the target of events of this nature and expects to be subject to similar attacks in the future. GCI engages in a variety of preventive measures at an increased cost to GCI, in order to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and safeguard its infrastructure and confidential customer information, but as with all companies, these measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all cyberattacks, system compromises or misuses of data. Such measures include, but are not limited to the following industry best practices: application whitelisting, anti-malware, message and spam filtering, encryption, advanced firewalls, threat detection, and URL filtering. Despite these preventive and detective actions, GCI\u2019s efforts may be insufficient to repel a major cyberattack or network disruption in the future and prevent the risks described above.\nSome of the most significant risks to GCI\u2019s information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure include:\n\u2022\nCyberattacks that disrupt, damage, and gain unauthorized access to GCI\u2019s network and computer systems including data breaches caused by criminal or terrorist activities;\n\u2022\nUndesired human actions including intentional or accidental errors and break-ins;\n\u2022\nMalware (including viruses, worms, cryptoware, and Trojan horses), software defects, unsolicited mass advertising, denial of service, ransomware, and other malicious or abusive attacks by third parties; and\n\u2022\nUnauthorized access to GCI\u2019s information technology, billing, customer care, and provisioning systems and networks and those of its vendors and other providers.\nIf hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to GCI\u2019s technology systems, networks, or infrastructure, they may be able to access, steal, publish, delete, misappropriate, modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential customer or employee data. Moreover, additional harm to customers or employees could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential customer data. A network disruption (including one resulting from a cyberattack) could cause an interruption or degradation of service and diversion of management attention, as well as permit access, theft, publishing, deletion, misappropriation, or modification to or of confidential customer data. Due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks, GCI may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access.\nThe costs imposed on the Company as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant. Among others, such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures, litigation, regulatory actions, fines, sanctions, lost revenue from business interruption, and damage to the public\u2019s perception regarding the Company's ability to provide a secure service. As a result, a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and operating results. The Company also faces similar risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which it is affiliated or otherwise conduct business. While the Company maintains cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party insurance coverage, its insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all of its losses from any future disruptions or breaches of its systems or other events as described above.\nIncreases in data usage on GCI\u2019s wired and wireless networks may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for GCI\u2019s customers.\nVideo streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional Internet activity such as web browsing and email. As use of these services continues to grow, GCI\u2019s customers will likely use more bandwidth than in the past. Additionally, new wireless handsets and devices may place a higher demand for data on GCI\u2019s wireless network. If this occurs, GCI could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions, service degradation or slower transmission speeds for its customers. Alternatively, GCI could choose to implement network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, which could negatively affect its ability to retain and attract customers in affected areas. While the Company believes demand for these services may drive customers to pay for faster speeds, competitive or regulatory constraints may preclude GCI from recovering the costs of the necessary network investments which could result in an adverse impact to its business, financial condition, and operating results.\nProlonged service interruptions or system failures could affect GCI\u2019s business.\nGCI relies heavily on its network equipment, communications providers, data and software to support all of its functions. GCI relies on its networks and the networks of others for substantially all of its revenue. GCI is able to deliver services and serve its customers only to the extent that it can protect its network systems against damage from power or\nI-22\ncommunication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other disruptions. While GCI endeavors to provide for failures in the network by providing back-up systems and procedures, GCI cannot guarantee that these back-up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency. Disruption to its billing systems due to a failure of existing hardware and backup protocols could have an adverse effect on the Company's revenue and cash flow. Should GCI experience a prolonged failure, it could seriously jeopardize its ability to continue operations. In particular, should a significant service interruption occur, GCI\u2019s ongoing customers may choose a different provider, and its reputation may be damaged, reducing its attractiveness to new customers.\nIf failures occur in GCI\u2019s undersea fiber optic cable systems or GCI\u2019s TERRA facilities and its extensions, GCI\u2019s ability to immediately restore the entirety of GCI\u2019s service may be limited and the Company could incur significant costs.\nGCI\u2019s communications facilities include undersea fiber optic cable systems that carry a large portion of its traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states, one of which provides an alternative geographically diverse backup communication facility to the other. GCI\u2019s facilities also include TERRA and its extensions some of which are unringed, operating in a remote environment and are at times difficult to access for repairs. Damage to an undersea fiber optic cable system or TERRA and its extensions could result in significant unplanned expense. For example, in January 2020, a fiber break occurred in GCI\u2019s TERRA ring in Alaska\u2019s Cook Inlet. Although service has been unaffected and the financial impact is not expected to be significant, full functionality is not expected to be restored until March 2020 due to the uniquely challenging environmental conditions in the location of the fiber break. If a failure of both sides of the ring of GCI\u2019s undersea fiber optic facilities or GCI\u2019s ringed TERRA facility and its unringed extensions occurs and GCI is not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services GCI offers to its customers could be interrupted, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nIf a failure occurs in GCI\u2019s satellite communications systems, GCI\u2019s ability to immediately restore the entirety of its service may be limited.\nGCI\u2019s communications facilities include satellite transponders that GCI uses to serve many rural and remote Alaska locations. Each of GCI\u2019s C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders are backed up using on-board transponder redundancy. In the event of a complete spacecraft failure the services are restored using capacity on other spacecraft that are held in reserve. If a failure of GCI\u2019s satellite transponders occurs and GCI is not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services GCI offers to its customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nGCI depends on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply communications equipment. If GCI does not obtain the necessary communications equipment, GCI will not be able to meet the needs of its customers.\nGCI depends on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply wireless, Internet, video and other telephony-related equipment. If GCI\u2019s providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet GCI\u2019s needs or provide them at an acceptable cost, GCI may not be able to satisfy demand for its services and competitors may fulfill this demand. Due to the unique characteristics of the Alaska communications markets (i.e., remote locations, rural, satellite-served, low density populations, and the Company's leading edge services and products), in many situations GCI deploys and utilizes specialized, advanced technology and equipment that may not have a large market or demand. GCI\u2019s vendors may not succeed in developing sufficient market penetration to sustain continuing production and may fail. Vendor bankruptcy, or acquisition without continuing product support by the acquiring company, may require GCI to replace technology before its otherwise useful end of life due to lack of on-going vendor support and product development.\nThe suppliers and vendors on which GCI relies may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which GCI depends, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. The Company is unable to predict whether GCI\u2019s business will be affected by any such litigation. The Company expects GCI\u2019s dependence on key suppliers to continue as they develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. The failure of GCI\u2019s key suppliers to provide products or product support could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, and results of operations.\nGCI does not have insurance to cover certain risks to which it is subject, which could lead to the occurrence of uninsured liabilities.\nAs is typical in the communications industry, GCI is self-insured for damage or loss to certain of its transmission facilities, including its buried, undersea and above-ground fiber optic cable systems. If GCI becomes subject to substantial\nI-23\nuninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities, the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.\nGCI uses a third-party vendor for its customer billing systems. Any errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruption could have adverse operational, financial and reputational effects on the Company's business.\nGCI's third-party billing services vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact GCI and over which GCI may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of this billing services system could disrupt GCI\u2019s operations and impact its ability to provide or bill for its services, retain customers, or attract new customers, and negatively impact overall customer experience. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on the Company's operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage.\nConcerns about health/safety risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for GCI\u2019s wireless services.\nGCI does not manufacture devices or other equipment it sells, and GCI depends on its suppliers to provide defect-free and safe equipment. Suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria. However, even if the devices GCI sells meet the regulatory safety criteria, GCI could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products GCI sells if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects. The Company cannot guarantee that GCI will be fully protected against all losses associated with a product that is found to be defective.\nPortable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks, including cancer, due to radio frequency emissions from these devices. Purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed from time to time against other wireless companies seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase the cost of doing business. GCI cannot be sure of the outcome of any such cases or that the industry will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks. The actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect GCI through a reduction in subscribers. Further research and studies are ongoing, with no linkage between health risks and mobile phone use established to date by a credible public source. However, the Company cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns.\nAdditionally, there are safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment. Concerns over any of these risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit GCI\u2019s ability to sell its wireless services.\nRisk Related to the Company as a Whole\nThe Company is a holding company with a substantial portion of its consolidated debt and other obligations held outside of its operating subsidiaries, and its ability to service that debt and such other obligations will require access to funds of its operating subsidiaries, which may be restricted.\nIn connection with the Transactions, the Company incurred substantial indebtedness, in addition to the indebtedness that GCI Liberty had outstanding prior to the completion of the Transactions, of $1.0 billion in term loan borrowings pursuant to the margin loan facility entered into by Broadband Holdco, LLC (\u201cBroadband HoldCo\u201d), which margin loan facility included the ability to request additional term loan facilities or increase the amount of the initial loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million (the \u201cMargin Loan\u201d). Subsequently, in October 2018, Broadband Holdco entered into Amendment No. 1 (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to the Margin Loan (the \u201cMargin Loan Agreement\u201d). The Amendment established a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $200 million (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) and reduced the existing term loan credit facility under the Margin Loan Agreement to $800 million (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d). In November 2019, Broadband Holdco entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Margin Loan Agreement which established commitments for a new delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $300.0. million (\"Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility\" and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility, the \u201cMargin Loan Facility\u201d). The Margin Loan Facility is secured by a pledge of approximately 42.7 million shares of Series C common stock of Liberty Broadband, which constitutes substantially all of the assets of Broadband Holdco. Following the Transactions, the Company's indebtedness as it existed prior to the Transactions is held through GCI, LLC, an intermediate holding company of GCI Liberty that holds, in turn, all of the capital stock of GCI Liberty's legacy operating subsidiaries, as well as all of the contributed HoldCo assets, including Broadband Holdco. The Company expects that the GCI Holdings operating subsidiaries will generate substantially all of the cash flow of its consolidated company. As of December 31, 2019, the indebtedness of GCI, LLC consists of $1,300.0 million in borrowings\nI-24\nunder the Margin Loan Facility, $775.0 million in outstanding 6.625% senior notes due 2024 and the 6.875% senior notes due 2025 (together, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) and $512.7 million in outstanding term and revolving loans under a senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the \u201cSenior Credit Facility\u201d). In addition, as of December 31, 2019, the indebtedness of GCI Liberty includes $477.3 million of its outstanding 1.75% exchangeable senior debentures due 2046.\nQurate Retail, Liberty LLC, and GCI Liberty have entered into an indemnification agreement with the other parties thereto pursuant to which, among other things, (1) GCI Liberty will indemnify Liberty LLC with respect to any of Liberty LLC's 1.75% Exchangeable Debentures due 2046 (the \u201cLiberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures\u201d) surrendered for exchange to Liberty LLC on or before October 5, 2023 for the amount by which (i) the exchange value exceeds (ii) the sum of the adjusted principal amount of such Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures plus the amount of certain tax benefits attributable to such Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures so exchanged, and (2) Qurate Retail and GCI Liberty will indemnify each other with respect to certain potential losses in respect of the HoldCo Split-Off.\nThe ability of GCI Liberty, GCI, LLC, and Broadband Holdco to service their respective financial obligations will depend on their ability to access cash. The ability of GCI Liberty or GCI, LLC to access the cash of GCI Liberty's legacy operating subsidiaries will depend on those subsidiaries individual operating results and any statutory or regulatory restrictions. In addition, covenants included in GCI, LLC's Senior Notes and Senior Credit Facility will limit the ability of GCI, LLC to upstream cash to GCI Liberty or downstream cash to Broadband Holdco for this purpose. GCI Liberty's other potential sources of cash include its available cash balances, dividends and interest from its investments, monetization of the public investment portfolio contributed to GCI Liberty in the Transactions, and proceeds from asset sales. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to maintain the amounts of cash or marketable securities that it has.\nThe Company's significant debt and lease obligations could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company has and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and lease obligations including capital, operating, and the tower obligations (see note 9 of its consolidated financial statements found in Part II of this report for additional information). The Company's high level of debt and lease obligations could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nIncreasing the Company's vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nRequiring a substantial portion of the Company's cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing its ability to use its cash flows to fund operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nExposing the Company to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent of any future borrowings at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nMaking it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its obligations with respect to its indebtedness;\n\u2022\nRestricting the Company from making strategic acquisitions or causing it to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nLimiting the Company's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product and service development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nLimiting the Company's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business or market conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that the Company's leverage may prevent it from exploiting.\nThe Company will require a significant amount of cash to service its debt and to meet other obligations. The Company's ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control. If the Company is unable to meet its future capital needs it may be necessary for it to curtail, delay or abandon its business growth plans. If the Company incurs significant additional indebtedness to fund its plans, it could cause a decline in its credit rating and could increase its borrowing costs or limit its ability to raise additional capital.\nThe Company will continue to require a significant amount of cash to satisfy its debt service requirements and to meet other obligations. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has outstanding approximately $3.1 billion principal amount of indebtedness on a consolidated basis. The Company's ability to make payments on and to refinance its debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on its ability to generate cash and to arrange additional financing in the future. These abilities are subject to, among other factors, the Company's credit rating, its financial performance, general economic conditions, prevailing market conditions, the state of competition in its market, the outcome of certain legislative and regulatory issues and other factors that may be beyond its control. The Company's business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to it in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its debt or to fund its other liquidity needs. The Company may need to refinance all or a portion of its debt on or before maturity. The Company may\nI-25\nnot be able to refinance any of its debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe terms of the Company's debt obligations impose restrictions on it that may affect its ability to successfully operate its business and its ability to make payments on the debt obligations.\nThe indentures governing the Company's Senior Notes and/or the credit agreements governing its Senior Credit Facility and other loans contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect its ability to finance its future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in its best interest.\nThe various covenants may restrict the Company's ability to expand or to pursue its business strategies. The Company's ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, it cannot be sure that it will be able to comply. A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures and/or the credit agreements. If there were an event of default under the indentures and/or the credit agreements, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately. Additionally, if the Company fails to repay the debt under the Senior Credit Facility when it becomes due, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility could proceed against certain of its assets and capital stock of its subsidiaries that it has pledged to them as security. The Company's assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under its outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.\nWhen the Company's Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, it may not be able to refinance or replace them.\nWhen the Company's Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, it will likely need to refinance them and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. If the Company is able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict its financial and operating flexibility.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects the Company to interest rate risk, which could cause its debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nThe Company's borrowings under its Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose it to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, the Company's debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and its net income and cash flow could decrease.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s variable rate indebtedness uses London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the rate. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021 (the \u201cFCA Announcement\u201d). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021 and, based on the foregoing, it appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. The effects of the FCA Announcement cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of the Company\u2019s variable rate indebtedness.\nIn order to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate risk, in the future, it may enter into derivative financial instruments, typically interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments. If the Company is unable to enter into interest rate swaps, it may adversely affect its cash flow and may impact its ability to make required principal and interest payments on its indebtedness.\nAny significant impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets would lead to a reduction in its net operating performance and a decrease in its assets.\nThe Company had $1.2 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2019, consisting of goodwill of $855.8 million, cable certificates of $305.0 million, wireless licenses of $35.0 million and other intangibles of $6.5 million. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition. The Company's cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business. The Company's wireless licenses are from the FCC and give it the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.\nIf the Company makes changes in its business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect its operations, it may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to a decrease in its assets and a reduction in its net operating\nI-26\nperformance. The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, the Company is required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the goodwill and/or the indefinite-lived intangible assets, as appropriate, in the period in which the determination is made. The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment requires the Company to make significant estimates about its future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies. Any changes to key assumptions, or actual performance compared with those assumptions, about the Company's business and its future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value, resulting in an impairment charge.\nDue to increased uncertainty around long-term wireless revenue, an impairment loss of $157.0 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to wireless licenses. The fair value of the wireless licenses was determined using an income approach (level 3). Due to certain market factors impacting GCI Holdings' operating results for the year ended December 31, 2018, impairment losses of $135.8 million and $65.0 million were recorded related to goodwill and cable certificates, respectively. The fair value of the cable certificates and the GCI Holdings reporting unit was determined using an income approach (Level 3). As of December 31, 2019, accumulated goodwill impairment losses for GCI Holdings totaled $135.8 million.\nThe Company's ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and disallowed business interest carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had federal and state net operating losses and disallowed business interest carryforwards of $178.9 million (on a tax effected basis) and, under the Code, it may carry forward its federal net operating losses and disallowed business interest deductions in certain circumstances to offset current and future taxable income and thus reduce its federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If the Company experiences an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code and related Treasury regulations (generally, a cumulative change in ownership that exceeds 50% of the value of a corporation's stock over a rolling three-year period) at a time when its market capitalization is below a certain level or if proposed Treasury regulations under Section 382 of the Code issued during 2019 become final (taking into account the delayed effective date of such regulations), the Company's ability to use its federal net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited. This limit could impact the timing of the usage of the Company's net operating loss and disallowed business interest carryforwards, thus accelerating federal cash tax payments or causing certain federal net operating loss carryforwards to expire prior to their use, which could affect the ultimate realization of that deferred tax asset. Similar limitations may also apply at the state level.\nThe Company has identified a material weakness in GCI Holdings\u2019 internal control over financial reporting, that, if not properly remediated, could adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As described in \"Part II. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2019 due to a material weakness at our wholly-owned subsidiary, GCI Holdings. As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we identified two material weaknesses in GCI Holdings\u2019 internal control over financial reporting one of which was remediated during 2019. The other material weakness remained unremediated as of December 31, 2019 and exists due to:\n\u2022\nInsufficient staffing and training of certain control operators;\n\u2022\nInadequate assessment of financial reporting risks, which in turn contributed to reliance on business process controls that were not designed and operating effectively to adequately mitigate existing risks;\n\u2022\nBreakdowns in communication of expectations and prioritization of control execution to various levels of control operators;\n\u2022\nLack of accountability for effective control operation; and\n\u2022\nInsufficient monitoring activities to ensure that the components of internal control are present and functioning.\nAs a consequence, the information technology general controls around access to financially relevant systems were not consistently operating effectively to ensure that access to data and applications was adequately restricted to appropriate\nI-27\npersonnel. Additionally, certain business process controls were not appropriately designed to be responsive to existing risks, nor were they consistently operating effectively. The control deficiencies did not result in any identified misstatements, however, a reasonable possibility exists that material misstatements in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs further described in \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d the Company and GCI Holdings are taking the necessary steps to remediate the material weakness. The reliability of the internal control process requires repeatable execution and the successful remediation of this material weakness will require on-going training, monitoring and evidence of effectiveness prior to concluding that the controls are effective. Therefore, we cannot assure you the remediation efforts will be effective in the future or that additional material weaknesses will not develop or be identified.\nImplementing any further changes to GCI Holdings\u2019 internal controls may distract its officers and employees and entail material costs to implement new processes and/or modify its existing processes. Moreover, these changes do not guarantee that the Company will be effective in maintaining the adequacy of GCI Holdings\u2019 internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could harm our business. In addition, investors\u2019 perceptions that GCI Holdings\u2019 internal controls are inadequate or that the Company is unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm the price of the Company's common stock.\nFactors Relating to the Company's Common Stock and the Securities Market\nThe Company's stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of the Company's common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company's operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimated by securities analysts or the Company's ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign economic conditions.\nAlthough the Company's Series B common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets, there is no meaningful trading market for the stock.\nThe Company's Series B common stock is not widely held, with approximately 91% of the outstanding shares as of January 31, 2020 beneficially owned by John C. Malone, the Chairman of the board and a director of the Company. Although it is quoted on the OTC Markets, it is sparsely traded and does not have an active trading market. The OTC Markets tend to be highly illiquid, in part, because there is no national quotation system by which potential investors can track the market price of shares except through information received or generated by a limited number of broker-dealers that make markets in particular stocks. There is also a greater chance of market volatility for securities that trade on the OTC Markets as opposed to a national exchange or quotation system. This volatility is due to a variety of factors, including a lack of readily available price quotations, lower trading volume, absence of consistent administrative supervision of \u201cbid\u201d and \u201cask\u201d quotations, and market conditions. Each share of the Series B common stock is convertible, at any time at the option of the holder, into one share of the Company's Series A common stock, which is listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cGLIBA.\u201d\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if doing so may be beneficial to its shareholders.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation (\u201crestated charter\u201d) and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of it that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nauthorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;\n\u2022\nlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe existence of authorized and unissued stock, including \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which would allow the Company's board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the\nI-28\ncontinuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of it;\n\u2022\nclassifying the Company's board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of its board of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequiring shareholder approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of the Company's voting power or, in certain circumstances, the approval by at least 75% of the Board of Directors of GCI Liberty with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of GCI Liberty, a sale of all or substantially all of its assets or an amendment to its restated charter.\nIn addition, John C. Malone currently beneficially owns shares representing the power to direct approximately 28% of the aggregate voting power in the Company, due to his beneficial ownership of approximately 91% of the outstanding shares of its Series B common stock as of January 31, 2020.", "PERMNO": 17334, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "GLIBA"}
