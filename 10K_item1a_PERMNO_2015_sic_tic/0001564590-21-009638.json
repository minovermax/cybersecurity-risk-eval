The following are important risks and uncertainties that could affect our businesses, but we do not ascribe any particular likelihood or probability to them unless specifically indicated. Any of the risks and uncertainties set forth below, should they occur, could significantly and negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects and/or the trading price of our Class A common stock, our 5.125% Senior Notes, our 5.375% Senior Notes, our 3.750% Senior Notes, our 4.375% Senior Notes or our other securities.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES GENERALLY\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and governmental measures taken in response thereto, have materially adversely affected, and may in the future continue to materially adversely affect, the global economy, the United States economy and the global financial markets, resulting in a global recession that may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, including any successive waves or variants of the virus, or the emergence of another pandemic, and measures taken in response thereto, including \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and other restrictions and delays or complications in the implementation of vaccination programs, could continue to materially adversely affect the conduct of our businesses will depend upon future developments and conditions, which remain highly uncertain.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, and governmental measures taken in response thereto, have materially adversely affected the global economy, the United States economy and the global financial markets. Unemployment rates in the United States have increased dramatically to levels not experienced since the Great Depression. The United States reported 4.0% growth in GDP for the fourth quarter of 2020 following a significant improvement in the third quarter of 2020. Most economists expect the recovery, to continue throughout 2021. The U.S. equity capital markets (as measured by the S&P 500) suffered a more than 30% decline during the first few weeks of the pandemic after many national and regional governments implemented \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders. While the S&P 500 increased by 11.7% over the course of the fourth quarter of 2020, there can be no assurance that the broader equity markets will not suffer similar declines in future periods should the pandemic further harm the U.S. or global economy. Oil prices and interest rates remain low, primarily as a result of the decline in economic activity. All of these unprecedented developments in the global economy and the United States economy have led to substantial uncertainty about future economic conditions.\nOur revenues were adversely impacted in the fiscal year 2020 as a result of COVID-19 and its impact on the macroeconomic environment, including interest rates, FX, and oil prices, as well as causing continued dislocations faced by us and our clients. All these factors negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, market volumes, which have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Governmental actions in response to the pandemic, including in response to further spreading of the virus through successive waves or variants of the virus, such as \"shelter in place\" orders, have been confronted and may continue to be confronted with resistance. While vaccines have been approved, there may be a lengthy period of time before any vaccine is widely distributed. It is also uncertain whether there will be sufficient public confidence in the effectiveness of any vaccine to enable widespread vaccination of the public. Because of these and other factors, we are unable to predict the full impact of the pandemic if conditions persist, and there can be no assurance that these increased levels of volumes will be replicated in future quarters. Should these global market conditions be prolonged or worsen, or the pandemic lead to additional market disruptions, we could experience reduced client activity and demand for our products and services, counterparty defaults, impairments of other financial assets and other negative impacts on our financial position.\nA decline in economic conditions may also lead to constraints on capital and liquidity, a higher cost of capital, and possible change or downgrades to our credit ratings, and additional restructuring charges.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak, or the emergence of another pandemic, and measures taken in response thereto, could continue to negatively affect the global economy, the United States economy, and global financial markets and, in turn, materially adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the outbreak or pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities to contain the financial and economic impact of the outbreak or pandemic, the effects on our clients, employees and third-party vendors, and the overall impact on financial markets, the economy and society.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and governmental measures taken in response thereto, have severely disrupted the global conduct of business, and have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, our operations and our clients' operations, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, we have been required to implement operational changes, including transitioning a large portion of our workforce to remote working, thus exposing us to greater cybersecurity risks. The extent to which the pandemic, and governmental measures taken in response thereto, could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments,\nwhich are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and the actions taken by governmental authorities in response thereto.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and United States economies and financial markets. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The global spread of COVID-19 has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, significant reduction in business activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. As of February 26, 2021, the United States had the world\u2019s most reported COVID-19 cases, and all 50 states and the District of Columbia have reported cases of infected individuals. Several states and countries, including New York and the U.K., where we are headquartered, have declared states of emergency.\nThe economic and financial disruptions from the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as measures taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak, led us to implement operational changes as we executed our business continuity plan in the first quarter of 2020. We continue to take significant steps to protect our employees. While a majority of the front office personnel are working in a firm office currently, a majority of BGC staff members continue to work from home or other remote locations and disaster recovery venues. In all cases, the Company has mandated appropriate social distancing measures.\nAlthough our information technology systems have been able to support remote working to date, we cannot assure you that they will continue to be able to support the volume of business conducted remotely by our employees in the future or to address increased volumes as our workforce shifts to additional locations and venues. We are also dependent on third-party vendors for the performance of certain critical processes and many such vendors are continuing to operate under business continuity plans. In addition, many of our vendors\u2019 and clients\u2019 workforces continue to work from home or remote locations and their normal operations have been disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Working remotely may place additional stress on the telecommunications infrastructure in the areas where our employees live and work. Disruptions in the availability of internet and telephone service has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the ability of our employees to perform their operations remotely in a timely manner. An extended period of remote working by our employees could also increase our cybersecurity risk. Remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. While we have taken significant precautions to protect employees who work in our offices, no assurance can be given that measures will contain the spread of the virus. Even as phased re-openings continue for some workers and in some locations, the current increase in infections has led to the re-implementation of restrictions in many jurisdictions, including New York City, and further changes in state and local work orders or in our policies or those of our clients and vendors, including in response to further spreading of the virus through successive waves or variants of the virus, may impact work arrangements of our employees, clients and vendors for the foreseeable future.\nIn particular, any disruption in our Fenics business operations has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our results. We believe the pandemic\u2019s promotion of virtual and remote work arrangements will support existing trends of electronification across our business. A disruption or certain employees in our Fenics operations not being able to fully utilize our most advanced technology while working remotely has led and may continue to lead to an increased reliance on Voice and Hybrid brokerage, which may adversely affect our revenues and profit margins. Any disruption in the insurance markets may also adversely affect our businesses.\nIf significant portions of our, third-party vendors\u2019 or our clients\u2019 workforce, including executives or key personnel, are unable to work effectively because of illness, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic, this may impair our ability to operate our businesses, particularly when coupled with the significant increase in client trading volumes and inquiries. COVID-19 presents a threat to our employees\u2019 well-being. While we implemented a business continuity plan at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and continue to revise the plan to implement changes in state and local responses and development of protocols and other factors to protect the health of our employees, such plan cannot anticipate all scenarios. These factors significantly impacted productivity during the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020, and we experienced and may continue to experience a continuing loss of productivity or adjustment to our business over time. Additionally, due to the physical dislocations experienced by our brokers and clients, the pace of adoption of some of our newer fully electronic brokerage offerings has been and may continue to be adversely affected.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, including any successive waves or variants of the virus, or the emergence of another pandemic, and measures taken in response thereto could continue to materially adversely affect the conduct of our businesses will depend upon future developments, which are highly uncertain. While vaccines have been approved, there may be a lengthy period of time before any vaccine is widely distributed. It is also uncertain whether there will be sufficient public confidence in the effectiveness of any vaccine to enable widespread vaccination of the public. Any increase in the duration and impact of the pandemic, including any successive waves variants of the virus, as well as measures taken in response thereto, could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Global Economic and Market Conditions\nOur businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects have been and may continue to be affected both positively and negatively by conditions in the global economy and financial markets generally.\nOur businesses and results of operations have been and may continue to be affected both positively and negatively by conditions in the global economy and financial markets generally. Difficult market and economic conditions and geopolitical uncertainties have in the past\nadversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our businesses. Such conditions and uncertainties include financial pressures exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, fluctuating levels of economic output, interest and inflation rates, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, and fiscal and monetary policy. Economic policies of the current administration and Congress, potential increases in interest rates and potential changes to existing tax rates and infrastructure spending plans may change the regulatory and economic landscape. These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global markets that may have a positive or negative effect on our operating results, including the levels of trading, investing, and origination activity in the financial markets, the valuations of financial instruments, changes in interest rates, changes in benchmarks, changes in and uncertainty regarding laws and regulations, substantial fluctuations in volume and commissions on securities and derivatives transactions, the absolute and relative level of currency rates and the actual and the perceived quality of issuers, borrowers and investors. For example, the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and international central banking authorities directly impact our cost of funds and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold. In addition, changes in monetary policy may affect the credit quality of our customers. Changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our control and difficult to predict.\nOur revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of low trading volume in the financial markets in which we offer our products and services.\nThe global financial services markets are, by their nature, risky and volatile and are directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control. Any one of these factors may cause substantial changes in the U.S. and global financial markets, resulting in reduced transactional volume and profitability for our businesses. These factors include:\n\u2022\npandemics and other international health emergencies;\n\u2022\neconomic and geopolitical conditions and uncertainties in the United States, Europe, Asia and elsewhere in the world, including government deficits, debt and possible defaults, austerity measures, changes in interest rates, and changes in central bank and/or fiscal policies, including the level and timing of government debt issuances, purchases and outstanding amounts;\n\u2022\npossible political turmoil with respect to the U.S. government, the U.K, the EU and/or its member states, Hong Kong, China, or other major economies around the world;\n\u2022\nthe effect of Federal Reserve Board and other central banks\u2019 monetary policies, increased capital requirements for banks and other financial institutions, and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nterrorism, war and other armed hostilities;\n\u2022\nthe impact of short-term or prolonged U.S. government shutdowns, elections or other political events;\n\u2022\ninflation, deflation and wavering institutional and consumer confidence levels;\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital for borrowings and investments by our clients and their customers;\n\u2022\nthe level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and trading in certain equity, debt and commodity markets;\n\u2022\nthe level and volatility of the difference between the yields on corporate securities being traded and those on related benchmark securities, which we refer to as \u201ccredit spreads\u201d; and\n\u2022\nmargin requirements, capital requirements, credit availability, and other liquidity concerns with respect to our business, its clients, and the customers of its clients.\nLow transaction volumes for any of our brokerage asset classes generally result in reduced revenues. Under these conditions, our profitability is adversely affected since many of our costs are fixed. In addition, although less common, some of our transaction revenues are determined on the basis of the value of transactions or on spreads. For these reasons, substantial decreases in trading volume, declining prices, and/or reduced spreads could have material adverse effects on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAny downgrades of the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one or more of the major credit rating agencies could have material adverse effects on financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S. and throughout the world. This in turn could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Because of the unprecedented nature of any negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the ultimate impacts on global financial markets and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects are unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent. Additionally, the negative impact on economic conditions and global financial markets from further sovereign debt matters with respect to the U.K., the EU and/or its member states, Japan, China, or other major economies could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Concerns about the sovereign debt of certain major economies have caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally, and continued uncertainties loom over the outcome of the various governments\u2019 financial support programs and the possibility that EU member states or other major economies may experience similar financial troubles. Any downgrades of the long-term sovereign credit rating of the U.S. or additional sovereign debt crises in major economies could cause disruption and volatility of financial markets globally and have material adverse effects on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOver the past year, the Covid-19 pandemic has led to uncertainties about global economic growth, which may impact the stability of financial markets and lead to uncertainty with respect to the likely responses of governments and central banks. Any one of these factors, or others, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to the Geographic Locations of Our Business\nOur businesses are geographically concentrated and could be significantly affected by any adverse change in the regions in which we operate.\nHistorically, our business operations have been substantially located in the U.S. and the U.K. While we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas, we are still highly concentrated in these areas. Because we derived approximately 42.2% and approximately 25.2% of our total revenues on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 from our operations in the U.K. and the U.S., respectively, our businesses are exposed to adverse regulatory and competitive changes, economic downturns and changes in political conditions in these countries. If we are unable to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nThe U.K. exit from the EU could materially adversely impact our customers, counterparties, businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum regarding continued membership of the EU. The exit from the EU is commonly referred to as Brexit. On January 1, 2021, the UK formally left the EU and UK-EU trade became subject to a new agreement that was concluded in December of 2020. Financial services falls outside of the scope of this trade agreement. Instead, the relationship will largely be determined by a series of \u201cequivalence decisions,\u201d each of which would grant mutual market access for a limited subset of financial services where either party finds the other party has a regulatory regime that achieves similar outcomes to its own. It is currently unknown if or when equivalence decisions will be taken.\nIn light of ongoing uncertainties, market participants are still adjusting. The exact impact of Brexit on the U.K.-EU flow of financial services therefore remains unknown. This same uncertainty applies to the consequences for the economies of the U.K. and the EU member states as a result of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU.\nWe have implemented plans to ensure continuity of service in Europe and continue to have regulated entities in place in many of the major European markets. As part of our Brexit strategy, ownership of BGC Madrid, Copenhagen and Frankfurt & GFI Paris, Madrid and Dublin branches were transferred to Aurel BGC SAS (a French based operation and therefore based in the EU) in July 2020, BGC\u2019s Insurance division (Corant) has established new brokerage platforms in Cyprus and France and we have been generally increasing our footprint in the EU.\nRegardless of these and other mitigating measures, our European headquarters and largest operations are in London, and market access risks and uncertainties have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our customers, counterparties, businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, in the future the U.K. and EU\u2019s regulation may diverge, which could disrupt and increase the costs of our operations, and result in a loss of existing levels of cross-border market access.\nRisks Related to New Opportunities/Possible Transactions and Hires\nIf we are unable to identify and successfully exploit new product, service and market opportunities, including through hiring new brokers, salespeople, managers and other professionals, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause of significant competition in our market, our strategy is to broker more transactions, increase our share of existing markets and seek out new clients and markets. We may face enhanced risks as these efforts to expand our businesses result in our transacting with a broader array of clients and expose us to new products and services and markets. Pursuing this strategy may also require significant management attention and hiring expense and potential costs and liability in any litigation or arbitration that may result. We may not be able to attract new clients or brokers, salespeople, managers, or other professionals or successfully enter new markets. If we are unable to identify and successfully exploit new product, service and market opportunities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may pursue strategic alliances, acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures or other growth opportunities (including hiring new brokers and salespeople), which could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs and could dilute our stockholders. We may also face competition in our acquisition strategy, and such competition may limit our number of strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures and other growth opportunities (including hiring new brokers and salespeople).\nWe have explored a wide range of strategic alliances, acquisitions and joint ventures with other financial services companies that have interests in related businesses or other strategic opportunities. We continue to evaluate and potentially pursue or amend possible\nstrategic alliances, acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other growth opportunities (including hiring new brokers and salespeople). Such transactions may be necessary in order for us to enter into or develop new products or services or markets, as well as to strengthen our current ones.\nStrategic alliances, acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other growth opportunities (including hiring new brokers and salespeople) specifically involve a number of risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and product, service and market development and distraction of management;\n\u2022\ndifficulty retaining and integrating personnel and integrating administrative, operational, financial reporting, internal control, compliance, technology and other systems;\n\u2022\nthe necessity of hiring additional managers and other critical professionals and integrating them into current operations;\n\u2022\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022\nto the extent that we pursue these opportunities internationally, exposure to political, economic, legal, regulatory, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in a foreign country, including risks of possible nationalization and/or foreign ownership restrictions, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, foreign currency fluctuations, regulatory and tax requirements, economic and/or political instability, geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences among personnel in different areas of the world, exchange controls and other restrictive government actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities;\n\u2022\nthe risks relating to integrating accounting and financial systems and accounting policies and the related risk of having to recast our historical financial statements;\n\u2022\npotential dependence upon, and exposure to liability, loss or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control;\n\u2022\naddition of business lines in which we have not previously engaged;\n\u2022\npotential unfavorable reaction to our strategic alliance, acquisition, disposition or joint venture strategy by our customers, counterparties, and employees;\n\u2022\nthe upfront costs associated with pursuing transactions and recruiting personnel, which efforts may be unsuccessful in the increasingly competitive marketplace for the most talented producers and managers;\n\u2022\nconflicts or disagreements between any strategic alliance or joint venture partner and us;\n\u2022\nexposure to potential unknown liabilities of any acquired business, strategic alliance or joint venture that are significantly larger than we anticipate at the time of acquisition, and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with acquisitions, including costs in excess of the cash transition costs that we estimate at the outset of a transaction;\n\u2022\nreduction in availability of financing due to tightened credit markets or credit ratings downgrades or defaults by us, in connection with strategic alliances, acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other growth opportunities;\n\u2022\na significant increase in the level of our indebtedness in order to generate cash resources that may be required to effect acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndilution resulting from any issuances of shares of our Class A common stock or limited partnership units in connection with strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures and other growth opportunities in the event that these arrangements are amended or terminated;\n\u2022\na reduction of the diversification of our businesses resulting from any dispositions;\n\u2022\nthe necessity of replacing certain individuals and functions that are sold in dispositions;\n\u2022\nthe cost of rebranding and the impact on our market awareness of dispositions;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on our liquidity as a result of payment of cash resources and/or issuance of shares of our Class A common stock or limited partnership units;\n\u2022\nthe impact of any reduction in our asset base resulting from dispositions on our ability to obtain financing or the terms thereof; and\n\u2022\na lag in the realization of financial benefits from these transactions and arrangements.\nWe face competition for acquisition targets, which may limit our number of acquisitions and growth opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices or other less favorable terms. To the extent that we choose to grow internationally from acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, or other growth opportunities, we may experience additional expenses or obstacles. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional businesses or integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties.\nIn addition, the acquisition of regulated firms generally requires the consent of the home jurisdiction regulator in which the target is domiciled and those jurisdictions in which the target has regulated subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, one or more of these regulators may withhold their consent, impose restrictions or make their consent subject to conditions which may result in increased costs or delays.\nAny future growth will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable transactional candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity to fund these transactions. Future transactions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include payment of break-up fees, assumption of liabilities, including compensation, severance, lease termination, and other restructuring costs, and transaction and deferred financing costs, among others. In addition, there can be no assurance that such transactions will be accretive or generate favorable operating margins. The success of these transactions will also be determined in part by the ongoing performance of the acquired companies and the acceptance of acquired employees of our equity-based compensation structure and other variables which may be different from the existing industry standards or practices at the acquired companies.\nWe will need to successfully manage the integration of recent acquisitions and future growth effectively. The integration and additional growth may place a significant strain upon our management, administrative, operational, financial reporting, internal control and compliance infrastructure. Our ability to grow depends upon our ability to successfully hire, train, supervise and manage additional employees, expand our management, administrative, operational, financial reporting, compliance and other control systems effectively, allocate our human resources optimally, maintain clear lines of communication between our transactional and management functions and our finance and accounting functions, and manage the pressure on our management, administrative, operational, financial reporting, compliance and other control infrastructure. Additionally, managing future growth may be difficult due to our new geographic locations, markets and business lines. As a result of these risks and challenges, we may not realize the full benefits that we anticipate from strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures or other growth opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the changing demands we will face as we integrate and continue to expand our operations, and we may not be able to manage growth effectively or to achieve growth at all. Any failure to manage the integration of acquisitions and other growth opportunities effectively could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFrom time to time, we may also seek to dispose of portions of our businesses, or otherwise reduce our ownership, each of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations. Dispositions involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner (including long and costly sales processes and the possibility of lengthy and potentially unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals), or at all, disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management, loss of key employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such dispositions. In addition, if such dispositions are not completed for any reason, the market price of our Class A common stock may reflect a market assumption that such transactions will occur, and a failure to complete such transactions could result in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock. As a result of these factors, any disposition (whether or not completed) could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Change in LIBOR\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined, the expected transition away from LIBOR and the use of alternative reference rates, including financial risks arising from any changes in the valuation of financial instruments, and operational risks due to the potential requirement to adapt our information technology systems and operational processes to address the transition away from LIBOR.\nOur $350 million Revolving Credit Agreement is indexed to LIBOR. As of December 31, 2020, we had no indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. LIBOR is the rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. In July 2017, the head of the FCA announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. However, the ICE Benchmark Administration, in its capacity as administrator of USD LIBOR, has announced that it intends to extend publication of USD LIBOR (other than one-week and two-month tenors) by 18 months to June 2023. Several regulatory agencies have encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts using USD LIBOR as a reference rate by the end of 2021. Federal and state legislative proposals to adopt a replacement reference rate are currently under consideration. At this time, no consensus exists as to what reference rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, and it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the U.K. or elsewhere. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital and interest expense cannot yet be determined.\nThe expected withdrawal and replacement of LIBOR with alternative benchmarks also introduces a number of risks for us, our clients and the financial services industry more widely. Globally, vast amounts of loans, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the LIBOR benchmark, and any failure by market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to\nreplace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in disruption in the global financial markets in which we do business and suppress capital markets activities and trading volume. We may also be subject to legal implementation risks, as extensive changes to documentation for new and existing clients may be required, and operational risks due to the potential requirement to adapt information technology systems and operational processes to address the withdrawal and replacement of LIBOR.\nIn addition, any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, the use of various alternative rates, and disruption in the financial markets which rely on the availability of a broadly accepted reference rate, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Liquidity, Funding and Indebtedness\nWe have debt, which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and activities, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our businesses, expose us to interest rate risk, impact our ability to obtain or maintain favorable credit ratings and prevent us from meeting or refinancing our obligations under our indebtedness, which, depending on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur indebtedness, which at December 31, 2020 was $1,315.9 million, may have important, adverse consequences to us and our investors, including:\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to borrow money, dispose of assets or sell equity to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, debt service, strategic initiatives or other obligations or purposes;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy, the markets, regulatory requirements, our operations or businesses;\n\u2022\nour financial leverage may be higher than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nit may make us more vulnerable to downturns in the economy or our businesses;\n\u2022\nit may require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments;\n\u2022\nit may make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;\n\u2022\nit may increase the risk of a future downgrade of our credit ratings or otherwise impact our ability to obtain or maintain investment-grade credit ratings, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase shares of our Class A common stock and purchase limited partnership units; and\n\u2022\nthere would be a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing or refinance our existing debt on terms acceptable to us.\nTo the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or seek to refinance our existing debt, or the COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the local, national and global economies, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected and may impact the rate at which we make payments of obligations or occur additional obligations. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, dispose of assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt.\nSome of our borrowings have variable interest rates. As a result, a change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our interest expense. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds will increase, which could reduce our net income. In an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, we may rely on interest rate hedging or other interest rate risk management activities. These activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged borrowings. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are dependent upon availability of adequate funding and liquidity to meet our clearing margin requirements, among other financial needs. Clearing margin is the amount of cash, guarantees or similar collateral that we must provide or deposit with our third-party clearing organizations in support of our obligations under contractual clearing arrangements with these organizations. Historically, these needs have been satisfied from internally generated funds and proceeds from debt and equity financings. We have also relied on arrangements with Cantor to clear certain of our transactions under the clearing agreement we entered into with Cantor in November 2008 which was\namended in June 2020. Our next bond maturity is in May 2021 and the Company\u2019s senior unsecured revolving credit facility matures in February 2023. Although we have historically been able to raise debt on acceptable terms, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world\u2019s credit markets could make it more difficult for us to refinance or replace such indebtedness in a timely manner or on acceptable terms. Further, if for any reason we need to raise additional funds, including in order to meet regulatory capital requirements and/or clearing margin requirements arising from growth in our brokerage businesses, to complete acquisitions or otherwise, we may not be able to obtain additional financing when needed. If we cannot raise additional funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our businesses, take advantage of future growth opportunities or respond to competitive pressure or unanticipated requirements.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement contains restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our businesses.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that could impose operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things and subject to certain exceptions:\n\u2022\ncreate liens on certain assets;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake significant investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\ndispose of certain assets;\n\u2022\npay additional dividends on or make additional distributions in respect of our capital stock or make restricted payments;\n\u2022\nrepurchase shares of our Class A common stock or purchase limited partnership units;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on certain distributions from subsidiaries.\nIndebtedness that we may enter into in the future, if any, could also contain similar or additional covenants or restrictions. Any of these restrictions could limit our ability to adequately plan for or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict certain of our corporate activities. Any material failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Agreement as well as instruments governing our future indebtedness. Upon a material default, unless such default were cured by us or waived by lenders in accordance with the Revolving Credit Agreement, the lenders under such agreement could elect to invoke various remedies under the agreement, including potentially accelerating the payment of unpaid principal and interest, terminating their commitments or, however unlikely, potentially forcing us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, a default or acceleration under such agreement could trigger a cross default under other agreements, including potential future debt arrangements. Although we believe that our operating results will be more than sufficient to meet all of these obligations, including potential future indebtedness, no assurance can be given that our operating results will be sufficient to service our indebtedness or to fund all of our other expenditures or to obtain additional or replacement financing on a timely basis and on reasonable terms in order to meet these requirements when due.\nRisks Related to Our Senior Notes\nCredit ratings downgrades or defaults by us could adversely affect us.\nOur credit ratings and associated outlooks are critical to our reputation and operational and financial success. Our credit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including: operating environment, regulatory environment, earnings and profitability trends, the rating agencies\u2019 view of our funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels, our competitive position in the industry, our relationships in the industry, our relationship with Cantor, acquisitions or dispositions of assets and other matters. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances of that company or related companies warrant such a change. Any adverse ratings change or a downgrade in the credit ratings of BGC, Cantor or any of their other affiliates, and/or the associated ratings outlooks could adversely affect the availability of debt financing to us on acceptable terms, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we may obtain any such financing. In addition, our credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to clients of ours in certain markets and in certain transactions. A company\u2019s contractual counterparties may, in certain circumstances, demand collateral in the event of a credit ratings or outlook downgrade of that company. Further, interest rates, including with respect to our 5.375% Senior Notes, 3.750% Senior Notes and 4.375% Senior Notes, may increase in the event that our ratings decline.\nAs of December 31, 2020, BGC Partners\u2019 public long-term credit ratings were BBB- from Fitch Ratings Inc. and Standard & Poor\u2019s, BBB from Kroll Bond Rating Agency and BBB+ from Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. and the associated outlooks on all the ratings were stable. No assurance can be given that the credit ratings will remain unchanged in the future. Any additional indebtedness that we incur, as well as any negative change to our credit ratings and associated outlooks, may restrict our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt on favorable terms, and consequently. any resulting impacts on our funding access, liquidity or creditworthiness perception among our clients, counterparties, lenders, investors, or other market participants, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur acquisitions may require significant cash resources and may lead to a significant increase in the level of our indebtedness.\nPotential future acquisitions may lead to a significant increase in the level of our indebtedness. We may enter into short- or long-term financing arrangements in connection with acquisitions which may occur from time to time. In addition, we may incur substantial non-recurring transaction costs, including break-up fees, assumption of liabilities and expenses and compensation expenses and we would likely incur similar expenses. The increased level of our consolidated indebtedness in connection with potential acquisitions may restrict our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms, and such leverage, and any resulting liquidity or credit issues, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed herein.\nWe may incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indentures governing our 5.125% Senior Notes, 5.375% Senior Notes, 3.750% Senior Notes and 4.375% Senior Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt (with certain exceptions, including to the extent already secured), recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of our debt instruments that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our debt when due.\nWe may not have the funds necessary to repurchase our 5.125% Senior Notes, 5.375% Senior Notes, 3.750% Senior Notes or 4.375% Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event as required by the indentures governing these notes.\nUpon the occurrence of a \u201cchange of control triggering event\u201d (as defined in the indentures governing the 5.125% Senior Notes, the 5.375% Senior Notes , the 3.750% Senior Notes and the 4.375% Senior Notes), unless we have exercised our right to redeem such notes, holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of their notes at a price in cash equal to 100% of the then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. There can be no assurance that we would have sufficient, readily available financial resources, or would be able to arrange financing, to repurchase the 5.125% Senior Notes, the 5.375% Senior Notes, the 3.750% Senior Notes or the 4.375% Senior Notes upon a \u201cchange of control triggering event.\u201d A failure by us to repurchase the notes when required would result in an event of default with respect to the notes. In addition, such failure may also constitute an event of default and result in the effective acceleration of the maturity of our other then-existing indebtedness.\nThe requirement to offer to repurchase the 5.125% Senior Notes, the 5.375% Senior Notes, the 3.750% Senior Notes and the 4.375% Senior Notes upon a \u201cchange of control triggering event\u201d may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nThe requirement to offer to repurchase the 5.125% Senior Notes, the 5.375% Senior Notes, the 3.750% Senior Notes and the 4.375% Senior Notes upon a \u201cchange of control triggering event\u201d may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and/or the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors in our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off\nIf there is a determination that the Spin-Off was taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the tax opinion with respect to the Spin-Off were incorrect, or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nWe received an opinion of outside counsel to the effect that the Spin-Off, together with certain related transactions, qualified as a transaction that is described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and Newmark regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) could determine that the Spin-Off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for any other reasons. In addition, certain events occurring after the Spin-Off may not be in our control, including certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or Newmark after the Spin-Off. If the Spin-Off or a related\ntransaction is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Any such liabilities could be substantial and could have a negative impact on our financial results and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or may be prevented from using intellectual property necessary for our businesses.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our intellectual property, including our proprietary technology. We rely primarily on trade secret, contract, patent, copyright, and trademark law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights to proprietary technologies, products, services or methods, and our brand. For example, we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development, and we are currently pursuing patent applications around the world. We also control access to our proprietary technology and enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming.\nUnauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. We cannot ensure that our intellectual property rights are sufficient to protect our competitive advantages or that any particular patent, copyright or trademark is valid and enforceable, and all patents ultimately expire. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the U.S., or at all. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.\nMany companies, including those in the computer and financial services industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and sometimes file lawsuits based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, there has been a proliferation of patents applicable to these industries and a substantial increase in the number of such patent applications filed. Under current law, U.S. patent applications typically remain secret for 18 months or, in some cases, until a patent is issued. Because of technological changes in these industries, patent coverage, and the issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of our products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Although we have taken steps to protect ourselves, there can be no assurance that we will be aware of all patents, copyrights or trademarks that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services. Generally, it is not economically practicable to determine in advance whether our products or services may infringe the present or future rights of others.\nAccordingly, we may face claims of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights that could interfere with our ability to use intellectual property or technology that is material to our businesses. In addition, restrictions on the distribution of some of the market data generated by our brokerage desks could limit the comprehensiveness and quality of the data we are able to distribute or sell. The number of such third-party claims may grow. Our technologies may not be able to withstand such third-party claims or rights against their use.\nWe may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such claims or litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, and the diversion of resources and the attention of management, any of which could materially negatively affect our businesses. Responding to these claims could also require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement, stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages on our own behalf or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, and may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf our licenses or services from third parties are terminated or adversely changed or amended or contain material defects or errors, or if any of these third parties were to cease doing business or if products or services offered by third parties were to contain material defects or errors, our ability to operate our businesses may be materially adversely affected.\nWe license databases, software and services from third parties, much of which is integral to our systems and our businesses. The licenses are terminable if we breach or have been perceived to have breached our obligations under the license agreements. If any material licenses were terminated or adversely changed or amended, if any of these third parties were to cease doing business or if any licensed software or databases licensed by these third parties were to contain material defects or errors, we may be forced to spend significant time and money to replace the licensed software and databases, and our ability to operate our businesses may be materially adversely affected. Further, any errors or defects in third-party services or products (including hardware, software, databases, cloud computing and other platforms and systems) or in services or products that we develop ourselves, could result in errors in, or a failure of our services or products, which could harm our businesses. Although we take steps to locate replacements, there can be no assurance that the necessary replacements will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. There can be no assurance that we will have an ongoing license to use all intellectual property which our systems require, the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our IT Systems and Cyber-Security\nDefects or disruptions in our technology or services could diminish demand for our products and services and subject us to liability.\nBecause our technology, products and services are complex and use or incorporate a variety of computer hardware, software and databases, both developed in-house and acquired from third party vendors, our technology, products and services may have errors or defects. Errors and defects could result in unanticipated downtime or failure and could cause financial loss and harm to our reputation and our business. We have from time to time found defects and errors in our technology, products and service and defects and errors in our technology, products or services may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use our technology, products and services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption for other customers. As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies, products and services, and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our technology, products and services. Since our customers use our technology, products and services for important aspects of their businesses and for financial transactions, any errors, defects, or disruptions in such technology, products and services or other performance problems with our technology, products and services could subject our customers to financial loss and hurt our reputation.\nMalicious cyber-attacks and other adverse events affecting our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses or regulatory penalties.\nOur businesses require us to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. Developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure are challenging, particularly as a result of us and our clients entering into new businesses, jurisdictions and regulatory regimes, rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and technological shifts. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating and compliance systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including malicious cyber-attack or other adverse events, which may adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide services or products.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures, such as software programs, firewalls and similar technology, to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our customers\u2019 information, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of cyber threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability or disruption of service, computer viruses, acts of vandalism, or other malicious code, ransomware, hacking, phishing and other cyber-attacks and other adverse events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we have taken, these threats may come from external forces, such as governments, nation-state actors, organized crime, hackers, and other third parties, including outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within us. Given the high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including vendors, customers, counterparties, exchanges, clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of a cyber-attack on or breach of our operational systems, network, data or infrastructure.\nThere have been an increasing number of ransomware, hacking, phishing and other cyber-attacks in recent years in various industries, including ours, and cyber-security risk management has been the subject of increasing focus by our regulators. Like other companies, we have on occasion experienced, and may continue to experience, threats to our systems, including viruses, phishing and other cyber-attacks. The number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. The techniques used in these attacks are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched. If one or more cyber-attacks occur, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 operations, which could result in reputational damage, financial losses, customer dissatisfaction and/or regulatory penalties, which may not in all cases by covered by insurance. If an actual, threatened or perceived cyber-attack or breach of our security occurs, our clients could lose confidence in our platforms and solutions, security measures and reliability, which would materially harm our ability to retain existing clients and gain new clients. As a result of any such attack or breach, we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system, network or infrastructure damage and to protect against the threat of future cyber-attacks or security breaches. We could also face litigation or other claims from impacted individuals as well as substantial regulatory sanctions or fines.\nThe extent of a particular cyber- attack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber-attack, and any resulting damage may continue to spread. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber-attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber-attack.\nOur regulators in recent years have increased their examination and enforcement focus on all matters of our businesses, especially matters relating to cyber-security threats, including the assessment of firms\u2019 vulnerability to cyber-attacks. In particular, regulatory concerns have been raised about firms establishing effective cyber-security governance and risk management policies, practices and procedures that enable the identification of risks, testing and monitoring of the effectiveness of such procedures and adaptation to address any weaknesses; protecting firm networks and information; data loss prevention, identifying and addressing risk associated with remote access to client information and fund transfer requests; identifying and addressing risks associated with customers business partners, counterparties, vendors, and other third parties, including exchanges and clearing organizations; preventing and detecting unauthorized access or activities; adopting effective mitigation and business continuity plans to timely and effectively address the impact of cyber-security breaches; and establishing protocols for reporting cyber-security incidents. As we enter new jurisdictions or different product area verticals, we may be subject to new areas of risk or to cyber-attacks in areas in which we have less familiarity and tools. A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements. The SEC has issued guidance stating that, as a public company, we are expected to have controls and procedures that relate to cybersecurity disclosure, and are required to disclose information relating to certain cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in disclosures required to be made under the federal securities laws. While any insurance that we may have that covers a specific cyber-security incident may help to prevent our realizing a significant loss from the incident, it would not protect us from the effects of adverse regulatory actions that may result from the incident or a finding that we had inadequate cyber-security controls, including the reputational harm that could result from such regulatory actions.\nAdditionally, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations in countries where we do business. For example, the EU adopted a new regulation that became effective in May 2018, the GDPR, which requires entities both in the European Economic Area and outside to comply with new regulations regarding the handling of personal data. We are also subject to certain U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of personal data. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number. In addition to the increased cost of compliance, our failure to successfully implement or comply with appropriate processes to adhere to the GDPR and other laws and regulations relating to personal data could result in substantial financial penalties for non-compliance, expose us to litigation risk and harm our reputation.\nRisk Relating to Our Key Personnel and Employees\nOur ability to retain our key employees and the ability of certain key employees to devote adequate time and attention to us are critical to the success of our businesses, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur people are our most important resource. We must retain the services of our key employees and strategically recruit and hire new talented employees to attract customer transactions that generate most of our revenues.\nHoward W. Lutnick, who serves as our Chief Executive Officer and as Chairman of us and Newmark, is also the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cantor and President of CFGM, the managing partner of Cantor. Stephen M. Merkel, who serves as our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, is employed as Executive Managing Director, General Counsel and Secretary of Cantor and Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer of Newmark. In addition, Messrs. Lutnick and Merkel also hold offices at various other affiliates of Cantor. These two key employees are not subject to employment agreements with us or any of our subsidiaries. Our Board appointed Steven Bisgay as our Chief Financial Officer, effective January 1, 2020. Mr. Bisgay previously served as the Chief Financial Officer of Cantor. While Mr. Bisgay will no longer be involved in Cantor\u2019s operating businesses, including its investment bank and broker-dealer. Mr. Bisgay continues to oversee overlapping functions such as bondholder, lender, and rating agency relations at Cantor and its affiliates, including Newmark.\nCurrently, Mr. Lutnick and Mr. Merkel each typically spends at least 50% of his time on our matters, and Mr. Bisgay is expected to spend a significant majority of his time on our matters. These percentages may vary depending on business developments at us or Newmark or Cantor or any of our or Cantor\u2019s other affiliates, including SPACs sponsored by Cantor and other ventures or investments. As a result, these key employees (and others in key executive or management roles whom we may hire from time to time) dedicate only a portion of their professional efforts to our businesses and operations, and there is no contractual obligation for them to spend a specific amount of their time with us and/or Cantor and its affiliates. These key employees may not be able to dedicate adequate time and attention to our businesses and operations, and we could experience an adverse effect on our operations due to the demands placed on our management team by their other professional obligations. In addition, these key employees\u2019 other responsibilities could cause conflicts of interest with us.\nThe BGC Holdings limited partnership agreement and the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement to the extent that our executive officers and employees continue to hold Newmark Holdings limited partnership units following the Spin-Off, which includes non-competition and other arrangements applicable to our key employees who are limited partners of BGC Holdings and/or Newmark Holdings, may not prevent our key employees, including Messrs. Lutnick, Merkel and Bisgay, whose employment by Cantor is not subject to these provisions in the limited partnership agreement, from resigning or competing against us.\nIn addition, our success has largely been dependent on the efforts of Mr. Lutnick and other executive officers. Should Mr. Lutnick leave or otherwise become unavailable to render services to us, control of us would likely pass to Cantor, and indirectly pass to the then-controlling stockholder of CFGM (which is Mr. Lutnick), Cantor\u2019s managing general partner, or to such other managing general partner as CFGM would appoint, and as a result control could remain with Mr. Lutnick. If any of our key employees were to join an existing competitor, form a competing company, offer services to Cantor or any affiliates that compete with our products, services or otherwise leave us, some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor or another competitor instead of our services, which could adversely affect our revenues and as a result could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nInternal Controls\nOur management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. While the remediation is in process, if we are unable to successfully remediate this material weakness, or if we otherwise fail to implement and maintain an effective internal control environment, our operations, reputation and stock price could suffer, we may need to restate our financial statements and we may be delayed in or prevented from accessing the capital markets.\nAs a public company, we are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment is required to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal controls determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As such, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and stock price.\nOur ability to identify and remediate any material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting could affect our ability to prepare financial reports in a timely manner, control our policies, procedures, operations and assets, assess and manage our operational, regulatory and financial risks, and integrate our acquired businesses. Similarly, we need to effectively manage any growth that we achieve in such a way as to ensure continuing compliance with all applicable control, financial reporting and legal and regulatory requirements.\nAs disclosed in \u201cItem 9A - Controls and Procedures,\u201d management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Because of the material weakness identified, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. Management has taken immediate action to remediate the material weakness identified. While certain remedial actions have been completed, others are in process. If we are unable to successfully remediate this material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we otherwise fail to implement and maintain an effective internal control environment, our operations, reputation and stock price could suffer, we may need to restate our financial statements, and we may be delayed or prevented from accessing the capital markets.\nRisks Related to Seasonality\nThe financial markets in which we operate are generally affected by seasonality, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period.\nTraditionally, the financial markets around the world experience lower volume during the summer and at the end of the year due to a general slowdown in the business environment around holiday seasons, and, therefore, our transaction volume levels may decrease during those periods. The timing of local holidays also affects transaction volumes. These factors could have a material effect on our results of operations in any given period.\nThe seasonality of our businesses makes it difficult to determine during the course of the year whether planned results will be achieved, and thus to adjust to changes in expectations. To the extent that we are not able to identify and adjust for changes in expectations or we are confronted with negative conditions that inordinately impact seasonal norms, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Income Tax Regulations\nWe may be adversely affected by the impact of recent income tax regulations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act, was signed into law in the U.S. During 2020, the Treasury and the IRS released proposed and finalized regulations associated with certain provisions of the Tax Act to provide taxpayers with clarifying guidance. Certain provisions of the Tax Act, such as the reduction in the Federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%is expected to have a favorable impact on the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and net income as reported under U.S. GAAP in 2020 and subsequent reporting periods to which the Tax Act is effective, while other provisions, such as the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) is expected to have an unfavorable impact. We are continuing to evaluate the Tax Act and its requirements, as well as its application to our business and impact on our effective tax rate. The impact of the Tax Act may differ from our estimate for the provision for income taxes, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, additional guidance that may be issued, unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, and actions taken by the Company as a result of the Tax Act.\nRisks Related to General Market Conditions\nConsolidation and concentration of market share in the banking, brokerage, exchange and financial services industries could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects because we may not be able to compete successfully.\nIn recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and concentration of market share among companies in the banking, brokerage, exchange, and financial services industries, resulting in increasingly large existing and potential competitors, and increased concentration in markets dominated by some of our largest customers. In addition, some of our large broker-dealer customers, such as Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, and Credit Suisse, have reduced their sales and trading businesses in fixed income, currency, and commodities. This is in addition to the reductions in these businesses already completed by customers, including Morgan Stanley, UBS, and The Royal Bank of Scotland.\nThe combination of this consolidation and concentration of market share and the reduction by large customers of certain businesses may lead to increased concentration among our brokerage customers, which may reduce our ability to negotiate pricing and other matters with our customers and lower volumes. Additionally, the sales and trading global revenue market share has generally become more concentrated over the past five years among five of the top investment banks across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities.\nWe also face existing and potential competition from large exchanges, which seek or may seek to migrate trading from the inter-dealer market to their own platform. Consolidation and concentration of market share are occurring in this area as well. For example, in recent years, CME acquired NEX; BATS Global Markets acquired the foreign-exchange trading venue, Hotspot, from KCG Holdings (\u201cKCG\u201d). KCG was itself acquired by Virtu in 2017, while BATS was acquired by CBOE. In early 2018, the Intercontinental Exchange acquired BondPoint, a provider of electronic fixed income trading solutions, from Virtu Financial. In addition, the Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited acquired the London Metal Exchange, ICE completed the acquisition of NYSE Euronext, and London Stock Exchange completed its acquisition of Refinitiv in January 2021. Most recently, in February 2021, Tradeweb announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Nasdaq\u2019s U.S. fixed income electronic trading platform, formerly known as eSpeed. In 2013, BGC sold the eSpeed platform to Nasdaq, and subsequently launched a competing platform, Fenics UST. In addition, in April of 2019, Tradeweb completed its initial public offering, which may increase their ability to hire and acquire in competition with us. Finally, TP ICAP announced an agreement to acquire Liquidnet, an electronic trading network, in October 2020. This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. Consolidation among exchanges may increase their financial resources and ability to compete with us.\nContinued consolidation and concentration of market share in the financial services industry and especially among our customers could lead to the exertion of additional pricing pressure by our customers, impacting the commissions and spreads we generate from our brokerage services. Further, the consolidation and concentration among exchanges, and expansion by these exchanges into derivative and other non-equity trading markets, will increase competition for customer trades and place additional pricing pressure on commissions and spreads. These developments have increased competition from firms with potentially greater access to capital resources than we have. Finally, consolidation among our competitors other than exchanges could result in increased resources and product or service offerings for our competitors. If we are not able to compete successfully in the future, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nActions taken by central banks in major global economies may have a material negative impact on our businesses.\nIn recent years, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, policies undertaken by certain central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, the ECB, and the Bank of England, have involved quantitative easing. Quantitative easing involves open market transactions by monetary authorities to stimulate economic activity through the purchase of assets of longer maturity and has the effect of lowering interest rates further out on the yield curve.\nFor example, as of January 27, 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve held approximately $5.5 trillion worth of long-dated U.S. Treasury and Federal Agency securities which are not being traded or hedged. This compares to $2.9 trillion prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, $1.7 trillion at the beginning of 2011 and zero prior to September 2008. This has reduced volatility and volumes for listed and OTC interest rate products in the U.S. In addition, the Federal Reserve and other central banks may continue to use traditional methods to keep short-term interest rates low by historical standards.\nSimilarly, global FX volumes have been muted over various periods during the past several years, largely because low interest rates (themselves partially a result of quantitative easing) in most major economies make carry-trade strategies less appealing for FX market participants. In addition, increased capital requirements for banks and other financial institutions are likely to result in increased holdings of government securities, and these holdings will be less likely to be traded or hedged, thus reducing further transaction volumes in those securities. Since the new capital requirements make it more expensive for the banks and other financial institutions to hold assets other than government securities, the new requirements may also reduce their trading and hedging activities in corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. Moreover, many of our large bank customers have faced increasing regulatory scrutiny of their rates and FX businesses, and this may negatively impact industry volumes. These central banking policies may materially adversely affect our businesses, particularly our rates and FX businesses.\nThe migration of OTC swaps to SEF markets may adversely impact volumes, liquidity, and demand for our services in certain markets.\nBGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, our subsidiaries, operate as SEFs. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for \u201cmade available to trade\u201d products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized.\nAlthough we believe that BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange are in compliance with applicable rules, no assurance can be given that this will always be the case, that the market for these products will not be less robust, that there may accordingly be less volume and liquidity in these markets, that there may be less demand for our services or the market in general or that the industry will not experience disruptions as customers or market participants transition to the rules associated with the Dodd-Frank Act. While we continue to have a compliance framework in place to comply with both existing and proposed rules and regulations, including any potential relaxation of rules and regulations, our businesses in these products could be significantly reduced and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by applicable regulations.\nEven after the award of permanent registration status to our SEFs, we will incur significant additional costs, our revenues may be lower than in the past and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by future events.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act mandated that certain cleared swaps (subject to an exemption from the clearing requirement) trade on either a SEF or DCM. SEF and DCM core principles relate to trading and product requirements, compliance and audit-trail obligations, governance and disciplinary requirements, operational capabilities, surveillance obligations and financial information and resource requirements. While these principles may or may not be permanently enforced, we do know that we will be subject to a more complex regulatory framework going forward, and that there will be significant costs to prepare for and to comply with these ongoing regulatory requirements and potential amendments. We will incur increased legal fees, personnel expenses, and other costs, as we work to analyze and implement the necessary legal structure for full compliance with all applicable regulations. There will also be significant costs related to the development, operation and enhancement of our technology relating to trade execution, trade reporting, surveillance, compliance and back-up and disaster recovery plans designed to meet the requirements of the regulators.\nIn addition, it is not clear at this point what the impact of these rules and regulations will be on the markets in which we currently provide our SEF services. During the continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules, the markets for cleared and non-cleared swaps may continue to be less robust, there may be less volume and liquidity in these markets and there may be less demand for our services.\nOn June 25, 2020, the CFTC approved a final rule prohibiting post-trade name give-up for swaps executed, prearranged or prenegotiated anonymously on or pursuant to the rules of a SEF and intended to be cleared. The rule provides exemptions for package transactions that include a component transaction that is not a swap that is intended to be cleared. The rule went into effect on November 1, 2020 for swaps subject to the trade execution requirement under the Commodity Exchange Act Section 2(h)(8) and July 5, 2021 for swaps not subject to the trade execution requirement but intended to be cleared.\nDemocratic Party control of both houses of Congress and the U.S. Presidency could result in new regulations. While we continue to have a compliance framework in place to comply with both existing and proposed rules and regulations, it is possible that the existing regulatory framework may be amended, which amendments could have a positive or negative impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCertain banks and other institutions may continue to be limited in their conduct of proprietary trading and may be further limited from trading in certain derivatives. The new rules, including the proprietary trading restrictions for certain banks and other institutions, could materially impact transaction volumes and liquidity in these markets and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely impacted as a result.\nIf we fail to continue to qualify as a SEF under any of these conditions, we may be unable to maintain our position as a provider of execution and brokerage services in the markets for many of the OTC products for which we have traditionally acted as an intermediary. This would have a broad impact on us and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results operations, and prospects.\nOur commodities derivatives activities, including those related to electricity, natural gas and environmental interests, subject us to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and other risks that may result in our incurring significant costs and liabilities.\nWe engage in the brokerage of commodities derivatives, including those involving electricity and natural gas, and related products and indices. These activities subject us and our customers to extensive regulatory oversight, involving federal, state, and local and foreign commodities, energy, environmental, and other governmental laws and regulations and may result in our incurring significant costs and liabilities.\nWe or our clients may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations relating to our commodities-related activities, including trading of electricity, natural gas, and environmental interests. New regulation of OTC derivatives markets in the U.S. and similar legislation proposed or adopted abroad will impose significant new costs and new requirements on the commodities derivatives activities of us and our customers. Therefore, the overall reputation of us or our customers may be adversely affected by the current or future regulatory environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and fines for market participants.\nThe commodities-related activities of us and our customers are also subject to the risk of unforeseen catastrophic events, many of which are outside of our control, which could result in significant liabilities for us or our customers. We may not be able to obtain insurance to cover these risks, and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our liabilities. The occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from performing under our agreements with customers, may impair our operations, and may result in litigation, regulatory action, negative publicity or other reputational harm, which could have a material negative effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Insurance Brokerage Business\nWe face significant competitive pressures in the insurance brokerage business.\nThe insurance brokerage business is highly competitive, and many insurance brokerage firms actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business. We compete with global wholesale insurance and reinsurance brokers, including Aon, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., as well as numerous regional and specialist firms. Firms that we compete with may have greater financial, technical, and marketing resources, larger customer bases, greater name recognition, stronger presence in certain geographies, or more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have. In addition, new competitors in the insurance industry, alliances among competitors, or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share. Over the past decade, private equity sponsors have invested heavily in the insurance industry, creating new competitors, and strengthening existing ones. The insurance industry continued to see robust market consolidation in 2020, and this trend could continue or accelerate in 2021. If we fail to respond successfully to the competition we face, our insurance brokerage business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be negatively affected.\nOur ability to retain senior insurance brokerage management and key brokers is critical to the success of our insurance brokerage business.\nWe rely upon the contributions of our senior insurance brokerage management team to manage the future growth of our insurance brokerage business. The loss of any of these individuals could limit our ability to successfully execute our insurance brokerage business\u2019 strategy or adversely affect our ability to retain existing and attract new clients. Across all our insurance brokerage businesses, brokers and other employees are critical to developing and retaining client relationships as well as performing the services on which our revenues are earned. Losing key brokers who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise and/or the managerial and other professionals who support them could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements. Additionally, if a key insurance broker or employee were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company, some of our insurance brokerage clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services. Competition for experienced insurance brokers and employees is intense, and we are constantly working to retain and attract these individuals. If we cannot successfully do so, our insurance brokerage business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be negatively affected.\nWe may be subject to errors and omissions and other claims.\nThrough our insurance brokerage business, we assist our insurance brokerage customers by placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims. Errors and omissions (\u201cE&O\u201d) claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured. While we provide regular trainings to all our insurance brokerage staff, have a client servicing team and have instituted a file review process with peer to peer checks, it is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions. In addition, our insurance business is subject to other types of claims, litigation, and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which along with E&O claims, may subject us to liability for monetary damages, negative publicity or other reputational harm.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Compliance\nThe financial services industry in which we operate is subject to significant regulation. We are subject to regulatory capital requirements on our regulated businesses, and a significant operating loss or any extraordinary charge against capital could materially adversely affect our ability to expand or, depending upon the magnitude of the loss or charge, even to maintain the current level of our businesses.\nMany aspects of our businesses, like those of other financial services firms, are subject to significant capital requirements. In the U.S., the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the NFA and various other regulatory bodies have stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of these entities\u2019 activities. Five of our subsidiaries, BGCF, GFI Securities LLC, Fenics Execution LLC, Sunrise Brokers LLC and Mint are registered with the SEC and subject to the Uniform Net Capital Requirements. As a FCM, Mint is also subject to CFTC capital requirements. In December of 2018, BGCF submitted an application with the CFTC to withdraw its FCM license which was approved. BGCF now conducts its business as an Introducing Broker registered with the NFA. BGCF is also a member of the FICC, which imposes capital requirements on its members. We also hold a 49% limited partnership interest in Aqua, a U.S. registered broker-dealer and ATS. These entities are subject to SEC, FINRA, CFTC and NFA net capital requirements. In addition, our SEFs, BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, are required to maintain financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year, keeping at least enough cash or highly liquid securities to cover six months\u2019 operating costs.\nOur international operations are also subject to capital requirements in their local jurisdictions. BGC Brokers L.P., BGC European Holdings, L.P, GFI Brokers Limited, GFI Securities Limited and Sunrise Brokers LLP, which are based in the U.K., are currently subject to capital requirements established by the FCA. The capital requirements of our French entities (and its EU branches) are predominantly set by ACPR and AMF. U.K. and EU authorities apply stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of these brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of their activities. EU policymakers have introduced a new capital regime applicable to EU Investment Firms with a phased implementation beginning in June 2021. The U.K. has introduced a regime that, while applying different rules and methods, is largely similar in its objectives. This regime will enter into force beginning in January 2022, with a similarly phased implementation. The impact of both regimes on our firm will be dependent on further detailed legislative requirements, which will be published next year and in following years.\nIn addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the jurisdictions in which they do business, such as Australia and Hong Kong. These regulations often include minimum capital requirements, which are subject to change. Further, we may become subject to capital requirements in other foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may enter.\nWe expect to continue to maintain levels of capital in excess of regulatory minimums. Should we fail to maintain the required capital, we may be required to reduce or suspend our brokerage operations during the period that we are not in compliance with capital requirements, and may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration or withdrawal of authorization or other disciplinary action from domestic and international regulators, which would have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, should we fail to maintain the capital required by clearing organizations of which we are a member, our ability to clear through those clearing organizations may be impaired, which may materially adversely affect our ability to process trades.\nIf the capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against capital, our operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited. Our ability to withdraw capital from our regulated subsidiaries is subject to restrictions, which, in turn, could limit our ability to pay our indebtedness and other expenses, dividends on our Class A common stock, and distributions on our BGC Holdings limited partnership interests, and to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock or purchase BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, including from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners and others, and pursue strategic acquisitions or other growth opportunities. It is possible that capital requirements may also be relaxed as a result of future changes in U.S. regulation, although no assurance can be given that such changes will occur. We cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing. No assurance can be given that required capital levels will remain stable or that we will not incur substantial expenses in connection with maintaining current or increased capital levels or engaging in business restructurings or other activities in response to these requirements.\nIn addition, financial services firms such as ours are subject to numerous conflicts of interests or perceived conflicts, including for example principal trading and trading to make markets. We have adopted various policies, controls, and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, and we will regularly seek to review and update our policies, controls and procedures. However, these policies, controls and procedures may result in increased costs and additional operational personnel. Failure to adhere to these policies, controls and procedures may result in regulatory sanctions or customer claims.\nOur businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by new laws, rules, or regulations or by changes in existing law, rules or regulations or the application thereof.\nThe financial services industry, in general, is heavily regulated. Proposals for additional legislation further regulating the financial services industry are periodically introduced in the U.S., the U.K., the EU, and other geographic areas. Moreover, the agencies regulating the financial services industry also periodically adopt changes to their rules and regulations, particularly as these agencies have increased the focus and intensity of their regulation of the financial services industry.\nChanges in legislation and in the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the NFA, the U.S. Treasury, the FCA, the European Commission, ESMA and other domestic and international regulators and self-regulatory organizations, as well as changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of brokerage and could result in restrictions in the way we conduct our businesses. For example, the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the SEC and the CFTC are continuing to review the nature and scope of their regulation and oversight of the government securities markets and U.S. securities and derivative markets. Furthermore, in Europe, MiFID II was implemented in January 2018. MiFID II requires a significant part of the market in these instruments to trade on trading venues subject to pre- and post- trade transparency regimes and non-discriminatory fee structures and access. In addition, it has had a particularly significant impact in several key areas, including corporate governance, transaction reporting, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection. MiFID II also introduced a new regulated execution venue category to accompany the existing Multilateral Trading Facility regime. The new venue category is known as an OTF, and it captures much of the voice and hybrid trading in EU. Certain of our existing EU derivatives and fixed income execution business now take place on OTFs, and we currently operate one OTF for each of the U.K.-regulated entities, one in France at Aurel BGC and one MTF under GFI Securities Limited. In 2019, a new European Commission took office which may over the course of its five-year mandate or introduce new legislative proposals for the financial services sector. This will include various legislative reviews of MIFID, which have started in 2020. After the Brexit transition period, the U.K. may introduce new Financial Services legislation, which could deviate from EU legislation. The uncertainties resulting from the possibility of additional legislation and/or regulation could materially adversely impact our businesses. Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could result in fines, penalties, restrictions or limitations on business activity, suspension, or expulsion from the industry, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon us. The European Commission\u2019s CSD regulation (\u201cCSDR\u201d) introduces mandatory buy-ins for transactions where the seller fails to deliver the instrument contracted for in February 2022 to all transactions settled on an EU CSD. Market participants have warned for possible risks this may pose to market liquidity. There may also be some specific risks associated with the Matched Principal trading model. These risks are currently being addressed by various industry bodies.\nSimilarly, while the Volcker Rule will not apply directly to us, the Volcker Rule may have a material impact on many of the banking and other institutions with which we do business or compete. There may be a continued uncertainty regarding the application of the Volcker Rule, its impact on various affected businesses, how those businesses will respond to it, and the effect that it will have on the markets in which we do business.\nOther regulatory initiatives include Basel III (or the Third Basel Accord), a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk introduced by bank regulators in most, if not all, of the world\u2019s major economies. Basel III is designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage. The ongoing adoption of these rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and brokerage customers to operate proprietary trading businesses and to maintain current capital market exposures under the present structure of their balance sheets, and will cause these entities to need to raise additional capital in order to stay active in our marketplaces. Meanwhile, global \u201cBasel IV\u201d standards will be implemented across the globe in the years to come. Most of the requirements are expected to be implemented by national and regional authorities by around 2023, with certain delays announced by regulators recently due to COVID-19. The adoption of these proposed rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer customers to operate trading businesses and to maintain current capital market exposures under the present structure of their balance sheets, and will cause these entities to need to raise additional capital in order to stay active in our marketplaces. As a result, their businesses, results of operations, financial condition or prospects could be materially adversely affected, which might cause them to do less business. Such potential impact could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nFurther, the authorities of the U.K. and certain EU countries may from time to time institute changes to tax law that, if applicable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Similarly, the U.S. has proposed a series of changes to U.S. tax law, some of which could apply to us. It is not possible to predict if any of these new provisions will be enacted or, if they are, what form they may take. It is possible that one or more of such provisions could negatively impact our costs and our effective tax rate, which would affect our after-tax earnings. If any of such changes to tax law were implemented and/or deemed to apply to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including on our ability to attract, compensate and retain brokers, salespeople, managers, and other professionals.\n.Democratic Party control of both houses of Congress and the U.S. Presidency could result in new regulations. While we continue to have a compliance framework in place to comply with both existing and proposed rules and regulations, it is possible that the existing regulatory framework may be amended, which amendments could have a positive or negative impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form that such new laws and regulations might take may negatively impact trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact. Increased capital requirements may also diminish transaction velocity. We believe that it remains premature to know conclusively the specific aspects of the U.S., U.K. and EU proposals which may directly impact our businesses as some proposals have not yet been finalized and others which have been proposed remain subject to further debate. Additionally, unintended consequences of the laws, rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws, rules or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nExtensive regulation of our businesses restricts and limits our operations and activities and results in ongoing exposure to potential significant costs and penalties, including fines, sanctions, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements, and additional restrictions or limitations on our ability to conduct or grow our businesses.\nThe financial services industry, including our businesses, is subject to extensive regulation, which is very costly. The requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us and are not designed to protect the holders of our stock, notes or other securities. These regulations will often serve to restrict or limit our operations and activities, including through capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations, inspections, and investigations, which may result in costs, penalties, fines, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements, restrictions or limitations, and censure, suspension, or expulsion. Self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA and the NFA, along with statutory bodies such as the SEC, the CFTC, and the FCA, and other international regulators, require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. In addition, as a result of regulatory actions, our registration statements under the Securities Act will be subject to SEC review prior to effectiveness, which may lengthen the time required for us to raise capital, reducing our access to the capital markets or increasing our cost of capital.\nFirms in the financial services industry, including us, have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years, and penalties, fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the CFTC, FINRA, the NFA, state securities commissions and state attorneys general in the U.S., and the FCA in the U.K. and other international regulators, have increased accordingly. This trend toward a heightened regulatory and enforcement environment can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and this environment may create uncertainty. From time to time, we have been and are subject to periodic examinations, inspections, and investigations, including periodic risk assessment and related reviews of our U.K. group. As a result of such reviews, we may be subject to increased monitoring and be required to include or enhance certain regulatory structures and frameworks in our operating procedures, systems, and controls.\nIncreasingly, the FCA has developed a practice of requiring senior officers of regulated firms to provide individual attestations or undertakings as to the status of the firm\u2019s control environment, compliance with specific rules and regulations, or the completion of required tasks. Officers of BGC Brokers L.P. and GFI Brokers Limited have given such attestations or undertakings in the past and may do so again in the future. Similarly, the FCA can seek a voluntary requirement notice, which is a voluntary undertaking on behalf of a firm that is made publicly available on the FCA\u2019s website. The SMCR came into effect in the U.K. on December 9, 2019. Accountability requirements will fall on senior managers, and a wider population of U.K. staff will be subject to certification requirements. SMCR will likely increase the cost of compliance and will potentially increase financial penalties for non-compliance. These activities have resulted, and may in the future result, in significant costs and remediation expenses, and possible disciplinary actions by the SEC, the CFTC, the FCA, self-regulatory organizations and state securities administrators and have impacted, and may impact in the future, our acquisitions of regulated businesses or entry into new business lines.\nThe financial services industry in general faces potential regulatory, litigation and/or criminal risks that may result in damages or fines or other penalties as well as costs, and we may face damage to our professional reputation and legal liability if our products and services are not regarded as satisfactory, our employees do not adhere to all applicable legal and professional standards, or for other reasons, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nMany aspects of our current businesses involve substantial risks of liability. The expansion of our businesses, including into new areas, imposes additional risks of liability.\nIn the normal course of business, we have been a party to investigations, administrative proceedings, lawsuits, arbitrations, and other actions involving primarily claims for damages. In certain circumstances, we could also face potential criminal investigations, enforcement actions or liability, including fines or other penalties. Examinations, inspections, regulatory inquiries and subpoenas or other requests for information or testimony may cause us to incur significant expenses, including fees for legal representation and other professional advisors and costs associated with document production and remediation efforts. Such regulatory, legal, or other actions may also be directed at certain executives or employees who may be critical to our businesses or to particular brokerage desks. The risks associated with such matters often may be difficult to assess or quantify, and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time.\nA settlement of, or judgment related to, any such matters could result in regulatory, civil or criminal liability, fines, penalties, restrictions or limitations on our operations and activities and other sanctions and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Any such action could also cause us significant reputational harm, which, in turn, could seriously harm us. In addition, regardless of the outcome of such matters, we may incur significant legal and other costs, including substantial management time, dealing with such matters, even if we are not a party to the litigation or a target of the inquiry. For example, in September 2019, the Company settled investigations conducted jointly by the CFTC and the NYAG which alleged that certain emerging markets foreign exchange options (EFX options) brokers in the U.S. misrepresented that certain prices posted to their electronic platform were immediately executable when in fact they were not and that such brokers had communicated that matches had occurred when they had not. We have agreed to pay certain financial penalties in connection with the settlements and have agreed to a monitor for two years to assess regulatory compliance for certain of our businesses. In addition, in September 2020, the SEC announced a settlement with BGC regarding alleged negligent disclosure violations related to one of BGC's non-GAAP financial measures for periods beginning with the first quarter of 2015 through the first quarter of 2016. All of the relevant disclosures related to those periods and pre-dated the SEC staff\u2019s May 2016 detailed compliance and disclosure guidance with respect to non-GAAP presentations. BGC revised its non-GAAP presentation beginning with the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the SEC\u2019s guidance, and the SEC has made no allegations with regard to any periods following the first quarter of 2016. In connection with the SEC settlement, BGC was ordered to cease and desist from any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-11 thereunder, and Rule 100(b) of Regulation G, and agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1.4 million without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations. Further, during the fourth quarter, management identified the theft of UK tax payment related funds from the Company. The theft, which occurred over several years ending September 2020, was perpetrated by two individuals associated with the Company, and did not involve the operations or business of the Company. Litigation has commenced against the two individuals seeking recovery of stolen amounts. The cumulative impact to the Company\u2019s \u201dConsolidated net income (loss)\u201d as a result of the theft was determined to be $35.2 million. The Company expects to recover most or substantially all of the stolen funds through a combination of insurance and return of assets through litigation.\nWe depend to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain customers. We are subject to the risk of failure of our employees to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or to be adequately supervised by their managers, and to the extent that such individuals do not meet these requirements, we may be subject to the risk of fines or other penalties as well as reputational risk. As a result, if our customers are not satisfied with our products or services, or our employees do not adhere to all applicable legal and professional standards, such matters may be more damaging to our businesses than to other types of businesses. Significant regulatory action or substantial legal liability against us could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, or cause significant reputational damage to us, which could seriously harm us.\nRisks Related to Competition\nBecause competition for the services of brokers, salespeople, managers, and other professionals, in the financial services industry is intense, it could affect our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled brokers or other professional services personnel, in turn adversely impacting our revenues, resulting in a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur ability to provide high-quality brokerage and other professional services and maintain long-term relationships with our customers depends, in large part, upon our brokers, salespeople, managers, and other professionals. As a result, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel.\nCompetition for talent is intense, especially for brokers with experience in the specialized businesses in which we participate or we may seek to enter. If we are unable to hire or retain highly qualified professionals, including retaining those employed by businesses we acquire in the future, we may not be able to enter new brokerage markets or develop new products or services. If we lose one or more of our brokers in a particular market in which we participate, our revenues may decrease, and we may lose market share.\nIn addition, recruitment and retention of qualified professionals could result in substantial additional costs. We have been and are currently a party to, or otherwise involved in, several lawsuits and arbitrations involving competitor claims in connection with employee hires and/or departures. We may also pursue our rights through litigation when competitors hire our employees who are under contract with us. We believe such proceedings are common in the financial services industry due to its highly competitive nature. An adverse settlement or judgment related to these or similar types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects. Regardless of the outcome of these claims, we generally incur significant costs and substantial management time in dealing with them.\nIf we fail to attract new personnel, or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, or if we incur increased costs or restrictions associated with attracting and retaining personnel (such as lawsuits, arbitrations, sign-on or guaranteed bonuses or forgivable loans), our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face strong competition from brokerages, exchanges, and other financial services firms, many of which have greater market presence, marketing capabilities and financial, technological and personnel resources than we have, which could lead to pricing pressures that could adversely impact our revenues and as a result could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe financial services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so. We primarily compete with three major, diversified inter-dealer brokers and financial intermediaries. These include CME, TP ICAP and Compagnie Financiere Tradition (which is majority owned by Viel & Cie) (\u201cTradition\u201d), TP ICAP and Tradition are currently publicly traded companies. Other inter-dealer broker and financial intermediary competitors include a number of smaller, privately held firms that tend to specialize in specific products and services or geographic areas.\nWe also compete with companies that provide alternative products and services, such as contracts traded on futures exchanges, and trading processes, such as the direct dealer-to-dealer market for government securities and stock exchange markets for corporate equities, debt and other securities. We increasingly compete, directly or indirectly, with exchanges for the execution of trades in certain products, mainly in derivatives such as futures, swaps, options, and options on futures. Certain exchanges have made and will likely continue to make attempts to move certain OTC-traded products to exchange-based execution, or to create listed derivatives products that mimic the qualities of similar OTC-traded products. We also compete with consortia, which are created or funded from time to time by banks, broker-dealers and other companies involved in financial services to compete in various markets with exchanges and inter-dealer brokers. We may compete in OTC-traded products with platforms, such as those owned by MarketAxess Holdings Inc. and Tradeweb Markets, in fixed income products or various OTC FX platforms owned by exchanges such as CBOE and Deutsche B\u00f6rse. In addition, financial data and information firms such as Refinitiv and Bloomberg L.P. operate trading platforms for both OTC and listed products and may attempt to compete with us for trade execution in the future.\nSome of our competitors have greater market presence, marketing capabilities and financial, technological and personnel resources than we have and, as a result, our competitors may be able to:\n\u2022\ndevelop and expand their network infrastructures and product and service offerings more efficiently or more quickly than we can;\n\u2022\nadapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements;\n\u2022\nidentify and consummate acquisitions and other opportunities more effectively than we can;\n\u2022\nhire our brokers, salespeople, managers and other professionals;\n\u2022\ndevote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services;\n\u2022\nmore effectively leverage existing relationships with customers and strategic partners or exploit more recognized brand names to market and sell their products and services;\n\u2022\nprovide a lower cost structure and lower commissions and fees;\n\u2022\nprovide access to trading in products or a range of products that at any particular time we do not offer; and\n\u2022\ndevelop services that are preferred by our customers.\nIn addition, new competitors may emerge, and our product and service lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of our existing product and service lines. If we are not able to compete successfully in the future, our revenues could be adversely impacted, and as a result our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nCompetition for financial brokerage transactions also has resulted in substantial commission discounting by brokers that compete with us for business. Further discounting could adversely impact our revenues and margins and as a result could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur operations also include the sale of pricing and transactional data and information produced by our brokerage operations to securities information processors and/or vendors. There is a high degree of competition in pricing and transaction reporting products and services, and such businesses may become more competitive in the future. Competitors and customers of our financial brokerage businesses have together and individually offered market data and information products and services in competition with those offered and expected to be offered by us.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nWe are generally subject to various risks inherent in doing business in the international financial markets, in addition to those unique to the regulated brokerage industry, and any failure to identify and manage those risks could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe currently provide products and services to customers in many foreign countries, and we may seek to further expand our operations into additional jurisdictions. On a consolidated basis, revenues from foreign countries were approximately $1.5 billion, or approximately 75% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. In many countries, the laws and rules and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local regulations in every jurisdiction. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws and rules and regulations in a particular foreign jurisdiction could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally. If we are unable to manage any of these risks effectively, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nThere are also certain additional political, economic, legal, operational, and other risks inherent in doing business in international financial markets, particularly in the regulated financial services industry. These risks include:\n\u2022\nless developed automation in exchanges, depositories and national clearing systems;\n\u2022\nadditional or unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, capital requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the laws, rules and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities of each country in which we conduct business, including initiatives such as Brexit;\n\u2022\npossible nationalization, expropriation and regulatory, political and price controls;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\ncapital controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions;\n\u2022\nfailure to develop effective compliance and reporting systems, which could result in regulatory penalties in the applicable jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nreduced protections for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nadverse labor and employment laws, including those related to compensation, tax, health insurance and benefits, and social security;\n\u2022\noutbreak of hostilities or mass demonstrations, pandemics, etc.; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences arising from compliance with foreign laws, rules, and regulations to which our international businesses are subject and the repatriation of overseas earnings.\nCredit Risk\nCredit ratings downgrades or defaults by us, Cantor or another large financial institution could adversely affect us or financial markets generally.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of interconnectedness arising from credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the institutions. A default by one of our customers could lead to liquidity concerns in our business and, to the extent that Cantor or another entity that clears for us has difficulty meeting capital requirements or otherwise meeting its obligations, we may need to provide our own liquidity.\nAs a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity problems, losses, or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as \u201csystemic risk\u201d and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which we transact on a regular basis, and therefore could adversely affect us. Similarly, our vendors, including insurance companies and other providers, are subject to normal business risks as well as risks related to changes in U.S. and international economic and market conditions. Failure of any of these vendor institutions could also materially, adversely affect us.\nOur credit ratings and associated outlooks are critical to our reputation and operational and financial success. Our credit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including: operating environment, regulatory environment, earnings and profitability trends the rating agencies\u2019 view of our funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels, our competitive position in the industry, our relationships in the industry, including with Cantor, acquisitions or dispositions of assets and other matters. Our credit ratings and/or the associated rating outlooks can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides circumstances of BGC or related companies warrant such a change. Any negative change or a downgrade in credit ratings and/or the associated rating outlooks could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on acceptable terms, as well as the cost and other terms upon which any such financing can be obtained. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties in certain markets and in certain transactions. Additional collateral may be required in the event of a negative change in credit ratings or rating outlooks.\nOur activities are subject to credit and performance risks, which could result in us incurring significant losses that could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur activities are subject to credit and performance risks. For example, our customers and counterparties may not deliver securities to one of our operating subsidiaries which has sold those securities to another customer. If the securities due to be delivered have increased in value, there is a risk that we may have to expend our own funds in connection with the purchase of other securities to consummate the transaction. While we will take steps to ensure that our customers and counterparties have high credit standings and that financing transactions are adequately collateralized, the large dollar amounts that may be involved in our broker-dealer and financing transactions could subject us to significant losses if, as a result of customer or counterparty failures to meet commitments, we were to incur significant costs in liquidating or covering our positions in the open market.\nWe have adopted policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage credit and market risks, in both agency and principal transactions, leveraging risk reporting and control procedures and by monitoring credit standards applicable to our customers and counterparties. These policies and procedures, however, may not be fully effective, particularly against fraud, unauthorized trading, and similar incidents. Some of these risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers, counterparties, or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date, or properly evaluated. If our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not always successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are, or may be, exposed, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our insurance policies do not provide coverage for these risks.\nTransactions executed on a matched principal basis where the instrument has the same or similar characteristics to the counterparty may expose us to correlation risk. In this case, the counterparty\u2019s inability to meet its obligations will also result in the value of the instrument declining. For example, if we were to enter into a transaction to sell to a customer a bond or structured note where the issuer or credit support provider was such customer\u2019s affiliate, the value of the instrument would decline in value in tandem with the default. This correlation has the potential effect of magnifying the credit loss.\nWe are subject to financing risk because, if a transaction does not settle on a timely basis, the resulting unmatched position may need to be financed, either directly by us or through one of the clearing organizations, at our expense. These charges may be recoverable from the failing counterparty, but sometimes they are not. In addition, in instances where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged or widespread due to rapid or widespread declines in liquidity for an instrument, there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us, which, depending on their size and duration, could limit our business flexibility or even force the curtailment of those portions of our businesses requiring higher levels of capital. Credit or settlement losses of this nature could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDisruptions in the financial markets have also led to the exposure of several cases of financial fraud. If we were to have trading activity on an agency or principal basis with an entity engaged in defrauding investors or counterparties, we could bear the risk that the counterparty would not have the financial resources to meet their obligations, resulting in a credit loss. Similarly, we may engage in financial transactions with third parties that have been victims of financial fraud and, therefore, may not have the financial resources to meet their obligations to us.\nIn agency transactions, we charge a commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in the negotiation of the price and other material terms of the transaction. After all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon, we identify the buyer and seller to each other and leave them to settle the trade directly. We are exposed to credit risk for commissions, as we bill customers for our agency brokerage services. Our customers may default on their obligations to us due to disputes, bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure, or other reasons. Any losses arising from such defaults could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn emerging market countries, we primarily conduct our businesses on an agency and matched principal basis, where the risk of counterparty default, inconvertibility events and sovereign default is greater than in more developed countries.\nWe enter transactions in cash and derivative instruments primarily on an agency and matched principal basis with counterparties domiciled in countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia. Transactions with these counterparties are generally in instruments or contracts of sovereign or corporate issuers located in the same country as the counterparty. This exposes us to a higher degree of sovereign or convertibility risk than in more developed countries. In addition, these risks may entail correlated risks. A correlated risk arises when the counterparty\u2019s inability to meet its obligations also corresponds to a decline in the value of the instrument traded. In the case of a sovereign convertibility event or outright default, the counterparty to the trade may be unable to pay or transfer payment of an instrument purchased out of the country when the value of the instrument has declined due to the default or convertibility event. The global financial crisis of recent years has heightened the risk of sovereign or convertibility events in emerging markets similar to the events that occurred in previous financial downturns. Our risk management function monitors the creditworthiness of emerging countries and counterparties on an ongoing basis and, when the risk of inconvertibility or sovereign default is deemed to be too great, correlated transactions or all transactions may be restricted or suspended. However, there can be no assurance that these procedures will be effective in controlling these risks.\nConcentration and Market Risk\nThe rates business is our largest product category, and we could be significantly affected by any downturn in the rates product market.\nWe offer our brokerage services in six broad product categories: rates, credit, FX, energy and commodities, insurance, and equity derivatives and cash equities. Our brokerage revenues are strongest in our rates products, which accounted for approximately 28.3% of our total brokerage revenues on a consolidated basis for the year ended December 31, 2020. While we focus on expanding and have successfully diversified our product offerings, we may currently be exposed to any adverse change or condition affecting the rates product market. Accordingly, the concentration of our brokerage businesses on rates products subjects our results to a greater market risk than if we had more diversified product offerings.\nDue to our current customer concentration, a loss of one or more of our significant customers could materially harm our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis, our top ten customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 27.8% of our total revenues. We have limited long-term contracts with certain of these customers. If we were to lose one or more of these significant customers for any reason, including as a result of further consolidation and concentration in the financial services industry, and not be compensated for such loss by doing additional business with other customers or by adding new customers, our revenues would decline significantly and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would materially suffer.\nOur revenues and profitability could be reduced or otherwise materially adversely affected by pricing plans relating to commissions and fees on our trading platform.\nWe negotiate from time to time with certain customers (including many of our largest customers) to enter into customized volume discount pricing plans. While the pricing plans are designed to encourage customers to be more active on our Fully Electronic trade execution platform, they reduce the amount of commissions and fees payable to us by certain of our most active customers for certain products, which could reduce our revenues and constrain our profitability. From time to time, these pricing plans come up for renewal. Failure of a number of our larger customers to enter into renewed agreements, or agreements on terms as favorable as existing agreements, could have a material adverse effect on volumes on our Fully Electronic trade execution platform, the commissions payable to us, our revenues and our profitability.\nReduced spreads in pricing, levels of trading activity and trading through market makers and/or specialists could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nComputer-generated buy/sell programs and other technological advances and regulatory changes in the marketplace may continue to tighten securities spreads. In addition, new and enhanced alternative trading systems, such as electronic communications networks, have emerged as alternatives for individual and institutional investors, as well as brokerage firms. As such systems do not direct trades through market makers, their use could result in reduced revenues for us or for our customers. In addition, reduced trading levels could lead to lower revenues which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have market risk exposure from unmatched principal transactions entered into by some of our desks, as well as holdings of marketable equity securities, which could result in losses and have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects for any particular reporting period. In addition, financial fraud or unauthorized trading activity could also adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOn a limited basis, our desks enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business to facilitate transactions, add liquidity, improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue opportunities and attract additional order flow or, in certain instances, as the result of an error. As a result, we have market risk exposure on these unmatched principal transactions.\nMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses for a specified position. We may allow certain of our desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are primarily for the purpose of managing proprietary positions, facilitating customer execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow. As a result, we may have market risk exposure on these transactions. Our exposure varies based on the size of the overall position, the terms and liquidity of the instruments brokered and the amount of time the position is held before we dispose of the position. Although we have limited ability to track our exposure to market risk and unmatched positions on an intra-day basis, we attempt to mitigate market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and active risk management, including hedging our exposure. These positions are intended to be held short term, and generally to facilitate customer transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, we may not be able to unwind the position and we may be forced to hold the position for a longer period than anticipated. All positions held longer than intra-day are marked to market.\nCertain categories of trades settle for clearing purposes with CF&Co, one of our affiliates. CF&Co is a member of FINRA and the FICC, a subsidiary of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. In addition, certain affiliated entities are subject to regulation by the CFTC, including CF&Co and BGC Financial. In certain products we, CF&Co, BGC Financial and other affiliates act in a matched principal or principal capacity in markets by posting and/or acting upon quotes for our account. Such activity is intended, among other things, to assist us, CF&Co, and other affiliates in managing proprietary positions (including, but not limited to, those established as a result of combination trades and errors), facilitating transactions, framing markets, adding liquidity, increasing commissions and attracting order flow.\nFrom a risk management perspective, we monitor risk daily, on an end-of-day basis, and desk managers generally monitor such exposure on a continuous basis. Any unmatched positions are intended to be disposed of in the short term. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the markets on which we trade, we may not be able to match the position or effectively hedge its exposure and often may be forced to hold a position overnight that has not been hedged. To the extent these unmatched positions are not disposed of intra-day, we mark these positions to market. Adverse movements in the market values of assets or other reference benchmarks underlying these positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a loss. In the event of any unauthorized trading activity or financial fraud that is not detected by management, it is possible that these unmatched positions could be outstanding for a long period. At the time of any sales and settlements of these positions, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair values. In addition, our estimates or determinations of the values of our various positions, assets or businesses are subject to the accuracy of our assumptions and the valuation models or multiples used. Any principal losses and gains resulting from these positions could on occasion have disproportionate effects, negative or positive, on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for any particular reporting period.\nIn addition, in recent years we have had considerable holdings of marketable securities received by us as consideration for the sale of certain businesses. We may seek to manage the market risk exposure inherent in such holdings by minimizing the effect of price changes on a portion of such holdings, including through the use of derivative contracts. There can, however, be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with these holdings, or that the costs of such hedging activities will not be significant. Further, any such hedging activities and other risk management techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including unpredicted price movements, counterparty defaults or other risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may have equity investments or profit sharing interests in entities whose primary business is proprietary trading. These investments could expose us to losses that could adversely affect our net income and the value of our assets.\nWe may have equity investments or profit sharing interests in entities whose primary business is proprietary trading. The accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our percentage ownership or profit share and whether we have any influence or control over the relevant entity. Under certain accounting standards, any losses experienced by these entities on their investment activities could adversely impact our net income and the value of our assets. In addition, if these entities were to fail and cease operations, we could lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits from trading.\nOther General Risks\nOur operations are global and exchange rate fluctuations and international market events could materially adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nBecause our operations are global, we are exposed to risks associated with changes in FX rates. Changes in foreign currency rates create volatility in the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues and expenses, in particular with regard to British Pounds and Euros. In addition, changes in the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated net assets are recorded as part of our results of operations and fluctuate with changes in foreign currency rates. We monitor our net exposure in foreign currencies on a daily basis and hedge our exposure as deemed appropriate with major financial institutions. However, potential movements in the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we earn revenues could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nFurthermore, our revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from social or political instability, changes in government policies or policies of central banks, downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative, political developments, and other events in such non-U.S. jurisdictions. Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. The impact of these fluctuations on our results could be magnified because generally non-U.S. trading markets, particularly in emerging market countries, are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets.\nEmployee misconduct, fraud, miscommunication or error could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain customers and subjecting us to significant financial losses, legal liability, regulatory sanctions and penalties and reputational harm; moreover, misconduct is difficult to detect and deter, and error is difficult to prevent.\nEmployee misconduct, fraud or error could subject us to financial losses, legal liability, and regulatory sanctions and penalties and could seriously harm our reputation and negatively affect us. Misconduct or fraud by employees could include engaging in improper or unauthorized transactions or activities, failing to properly supervise other employees or improperly using confidential information.\nEmployee errors and miscommunication, including mistakes in executing, recording or processing transactions for customers, could cause us to enter into transactions that customers may disavow and refuse to settle, which could expose us to the risk of material losses even if the errors and miscommunication are detected and the transactions are unwound or reversed. If our customers are not able to settle their transactions on a timely basis, the time in which employee errors and miscommunication are detected may be increased and our risk of material loss could be increased. The risk of employee error and miscommunication may be greater for products or services that are new or have non-standardized terms.\nIt is not always possible to deter and detect employee misconduct or fraud or prevent errors and miscommunications. While we have various supervisory systems and compliance processes and procedures in place, and seek to mitigate applicable risks, the precautions we take to deter and detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases.\nAlthough portions of our compensation structure are variable, significant parts of our cost structure are fixed, and if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs in the amount that our revenues decline, our profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nAlthough portions of our compensation structure are variable, significant parts of our cost structure are fixed. We base our overall cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services. If demand for these products and services and our resulting revenues decline, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis. If we are unable to reduce our costs in the amount that our revenues decline, our profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CORPORATE AND PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nBecause our voting control is concentrated among the holders of our Class B common stock, the market price of our Class A common stock may be materially adversely affected by its disparate voting rights.\nAs of February 25, 2021, Cantor (including CFGM) beneficially owned all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 58.6% of our total voting power. In addition, Cantor has the right to exchange exchangeable partnership interests in BGC Holdings into additional shares of our Class B common stock, and pursuant to an exchange agreement with us, Cantor has the right to exchange shares of our Class A common stock for additional shares of our Class B common stock.\nAs long as Cantor beneficially owns a majority of our total voting power, it will have the ability, without the consent of the public holders of our Class A common stock, to elect all of the members of our Board and to control our management and affairs. In addition, it will be able to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for approval and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of us. In certain circumstances, such as when transferred to an entity controlled by Cantor or Mr. Lutnick, the shares of our Class B common stock issued to Cantor may be transferred without conversion to our Class A common stock.\nThe holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock have substantially identical rights, except that holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share, while holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders in general. BGC Class B common stock is controlled by Cantor and is not subject to conversion or termination by our Board or any committee thereof, or any other stockholder or third party. This differential in the voting rights of our Class B common stock could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe possible restructuring of our partnership into a corporation is subject to various risks and uncertainties, may not be completed in the anticipated timeline, or at all, may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and will involve significant time and expense, potential tax or accounting charges and management attention, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe continue to explore a possible conversion into a simpler corporate structure, weighing any significant change in taxation policy. In particular, the Company is awaiting insight into future U.S. Federal tax policies, which remain uncertain after the results of the U.S. elections. Should the Company decide to move forward with a corporate conversion it will work with regulators, lenders, and rating agencies, and BGC\u2019s board and committees will review potential transaction arrangements.\nAny such restructuring is subject to various risks and uncertainties. There can be no assurance as to whether management will make a proposal or whether the Board will accept management\u2019s proposal, whether the restructuring will be completed in accordance with the expected timeline or whether it will achieve its anticipated benefits. Other factors such as changes in legal, tax, regulatory, political or other regimes could impact the potential transaction. If such transaction is completed, there can be no assurance that (i) our brokers and other employees, the rating agencies, our lenders, our bondholders, our investors, our counterparties, our clients, or others will view our new structure favorably, (ii) that the new structure will have the expected retentive effect on said employees or (iii) it will have the expected impact on our GAAP or non-GAAP results, cash position, cash or non-cash accounting charges, or other factors. Furthermore, the restructuring will involve significant time, expense and management attention. Any of these factors or others could negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDelaware law may protect decisions of our Board that have a different effect on holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nStockholders may not be able to challenge decisions that have an adverse effect upon holders of our Class A common stock compared to holders of our Class B common stock if our Board acts in a disinterested, informed manner with respect to these decisions, in good faith and in the belief that it is acting in the best interests of our stockholders. Delaware law generally provides that a Board owes an equal duty to all stockholders, regardless of class or series, and does not have separate or additional duties to different groups of stockholders, subject to applicable provisions set forth in a corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation and general principles of corporate law and fiduciary duties.\nDelaware law, our corporate organizational documents and other requirements may impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, which could deprive investors in our Class A common stock of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our Class A stockholders. Some provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our restated certificate of incorporation, and our amended and restated bylaws could make the following more difficult:\n\u2022\nacquisition of us by means of a tender offer;\n\u2022\nacquisition of us by means of a proxy contest or otherwise; or\n\u2022\nremoval of our incumbent officers and directors.\nThese provisions, summarized below, may discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions may also encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our Board. We believe that the benefits of increased protection give us the potential ability to negotiate with the initiator of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us and outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging those proposals because negotiation of them could result in an improvement of their terms.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of our Board, or in the event the Chairman of our Board is unavailable, by the Chief Executive Officer or by the holders of a majority of the voting power of our Class B common stock, which is held by Cantor and CFGM. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation permits us to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws require advance written notice prior to a meeting of our stockholders of a proposal or director nomination which a stockholder desires to present at such a meeting, which generally must be received by our Secretary not later than 120\ndays prior to the first anniversary of the date of our proxy statement for the preceding year\u2019s annual meeting. In the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than the close of business on the later of the 120th day prior to the date of such proxy statement or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by us. Our bylaws provide that all amendments to our bylaws must be approved by either the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote or by a majority of our Board.\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless the \u201cbusiness combination\u201d or the transaction in which the person became an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, or was the owner of 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock at any time within the prior three years, other than \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d prior to the time our Class A common stock was traded on Nasdaq. The existence of this provision would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, our brokerage businesses are heavily regulated and some of our regulators require that they approve transactions which could result in a change of control, as defined by the then-applicable rules of our regulators. The requirement that this approval be obtained may prevent or delay transactions that would result in a change of control.\nFurther, our Equity Plan contains provisions pursuant to which grants that are unexercisable or unvested may automatically become exercisable or vested as of the date immediately prior to certain change of control events. Additionally, change in control and employment agreements between us and our named executive officers also provide for certain grants, payments, and grants of exchangeability, and exercisability in the event of certain change of control events.\nThe foregoing factors, as well as the significant common stock ownership by Cantor, including shares of our Class B common stock, and rights to acquire additional such shares, and the provisions of the indentures for our outstanding notes discussed above, could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our Class A common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of the Class A common stock.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock.\nS&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell previously announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices, including the S&P 500, to exclude companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to such indices or limit their inclusion in them. In addition, several shareholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in such indices and may cause shareholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock. Any actions or publications by shareholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nWe are a holding company, and accordingly we are dependent upon distributions from BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo to pay dividends, taxes and indebtedness and other expenses and to make repurchases.\nWe are a holding company with no direct operations and will be able to pay dividends, taxes and other expenses, and to make repurchases of shares our Class A common stock and purchases of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in us or in our subsidiaries, only from our available cash on hand and funds received from distributions, loans or other payments, primarily from BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo. As discussed above, regulatory, tax restrictions or elections, and other legal or contractual restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely from our subsidiaries. In addition, any unanticipated accounting, tax or other charges against net income could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and to make repurchases.\nBGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo intend to distribute to their limited partners, including us, on a pro rata and quarterly basis, cash that is not required to meet BGC U.S. OpCo\u2019s and BGC Global OpCo\u2019s anticipated business and regulatory needs. As a result, BGC U.S. OpCo\u2019s and BGC Global OpCo\u2019s ability, and in turn our ability, to pay dividends, taxes and indebtedness and other expenses and to make repurchases will depend upon the continuing profitability and strategic and operating needs of our businesses, including various capital adequacy and clearing capital requirements promulgated by federal, self-regulatory, and other authorities to which our subsidiaries are subject.\nBGC\u2019s 2021 capital allocation priorities are to return capital to stockholders and to continue investing in its high growth Fenics businesses. BGC plans to prioritize share and unit repurchases over dividends and distributions. The Company plans to reassess its current dividend and distribution with an aim to nominally increase it toward the end of the year.\nTraditionally, our dividend policy provides that we expect to pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders based on our post-tax Adjusted Earnings per fully diluted share. Please see below for a detailed definition of post-tax Adjusted Earnings per fully diluted share. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, and for all of the quarterly periods in 2020, the Board reduced the quarterly dividend to $0.01 per share out of an abundance of caution in order to strengthen the Company\u2019s balance sheet as the global capital markets faced difficult and unprecedented macroeconomic conditions related to the global pandemic. Additionally, during 2020, BGC Holdings, L.P. reduced its distributions to or on behalf of its partners. BGC plans to reassess its current dividend and distribution with an aim to nominally increase it toward the end of the year. BGC believes that these steps will allow the Company to maintain its financial strength.\nAny dividends, if and when declared by our Board, will be paid on a quarterly basis. The dividend to our common stockholders is expected to be calculated based on post-tax Adjusted Earnings allocated to us and generated over the fiscal quarter ending prior to the record date for the dividend. No assurance can be made, however, that a dividend will be paid each quarter. The declaration, payment, timing, and amount of any future dividends payable by us will be at the sole discretion of our Board. With respect to any distributions which are declared, amounts paid to or on behalf of partners will at least cover their related tax payments. Whether any given post-tax amount is equivalent to the amount received by a stockholder also on an after tax basis depends upon stockholders\u2019 and partners\u2019 domiciles and tax status.\nWe are a holding company, with no direct operations, and therefore we are able to pay dividends only from our available cash on hand and funds received from distributions from BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo. Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by regulatory considerations as well as by covenants contained in financing or other agreements. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends may be payable only out of surplus, which is our net assets minus our capital (as defined under Delaware law), or, if we have no surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Accordingly, any unanticipated accounting, tax, regulatory or other charges against net income may adversely affect our ability to declare and pay dividends. While we intend to declare and pay dividends quarterly, there can be no assurance that our Board will declare dividends at all or on a regular basis or that the amount of our dividends will not change.\nOur Board and our Audit Committee have authorized repurchases of shares of BGC Class A common stock and purchases of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in us or in subsidiaries, from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners and others. On August 1, 2018, our Board renewed and increased the authorization to $300 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $249.9 million remaining under this authorization and may continue to actively make repurchases or purchases, or cease to make such repurchases or purchases, from time to time. In addition, from time to time, we may reinvest all or a portion of the distributions we receive from BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo in our businesses. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that future dividends will be paid or that dividend amounts will be maintained or that repurchases and purchases will be made at current or future levels.\nReductions in our quarterly cash dividend and corresponding reductions in distributions by BGC Holdings to its partners may reduce the value of our common stock and the attractiveness of our equity-based compensation and limit the ability of our partners to repay employee loans.\nOur Board has authorized a dividend policy which provides that we expect to pay a quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders based on our post-tax Adjusted Earnings per fully diluted share. On February 23, 2021, our Board declared a quarterly qualified cash dividend of $0.01 per share to Class A and Class B common stockholders of record as of March 16, 2021. Our Board took the step in the first quarter of 2020 of reducing the quarterly dividend from the previous $0.10 per share in order to strengthen our balance sheet as the global capital markets face difficult and unprecedented macroeconomic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict the duration of the current economic slowdown and its impact on our future quarterly dividend payments. Investors seeking a high short-term dividend yield may find our Class A common stock less attractive than securities of issuers continuing to pay larger dividends.\nOur ability to pay dividends is dependent upon our available cash on hand and funds received from distributions, loans or other payments from BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo. The BGC OpCos intend to distribute to its limited partners, including us, on a pro rata and quarterly basis, cash in an amount that will be determined by BGC Holdings, their general partner, of which we are the general partner. The BGC OpCos\u2019 ability, and in turn our ability, to make such distributions will depend upon the continuing profitability and strategic and operating needs of our business. We may not pay the same dividend to our shares as the distribution paid by the BGC OpCos to their limited partners.\nAdditionally, beginning with the first quarter of 2020 and for the foreseeable future, BGC Holdings has reduced its distributions to or on behalf of its partners. The distributions to or on behalf of partners will at least cover their related tax payments. Whether any given post-tax amount is equivalent to the amount received by a stockholder also on an after-tax depends upon stockholders\u2019 and partners\u2019 domiciles and tax status. Current or potential partners may find our equity-based compensation structure less attractive as a result. Moreover, we have entered into various agreements with certain partners, whereby these partners receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the partners receive on some or all of their limited partner units or may be forgiven over a period of time. The reduction in\nBGC Holdings distributions may adversely affect the ability of such partners to repay such loans. The inability of partners to repay the loans may require us to forgive a greater portion of such loans, increasing our compensation expense.\nWe believe that these actions reinforce the Company\u2019s ability to maintain financial flexibility during the pandemic and emerge from the crisis with market share gains, but we cannot assure you that such steps will prevent a decline in our financial condition. The Company plans to reassess its current dividend and distribution during year with an aim to nominally increase it from current levels. We may also repurchase shares of our common stock or purchase BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, including from Cantor or our executive officers, other employees, partners and others, or cease to make such repurchases or purchases, from time to time. In addition, from time to time, we may reinvest all or a portion of the distributions we receive in the BGC OpCos\u2019 businesses. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that future dividends will be paid, that dividend amounts will be maintained or that repurchases or purchases will be made at current or future levels. See \u201cItem 5 - Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Dividend Policy.\u201d\nIf our dividend policy is materially different than the distribution policy of BGC Holdings, upon the exchange of any BGC Holdings limited partnership interests such BGC Holdings limited partners could receive a disproportionate interest in the aggregate distributions by BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo that have not been distributed by us.\nTo the extent BGC Holdings distributes to its limited partners a greater share of that income that it receives from BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo than we distribute to our stockholders, then as founding/working partners, limited partnership unit holders and/or Cantor exercise any exchange right to acquire our Class A common stock or Class B common stock, as applicable, exchanging partners may receive a disproportionate interest in the aggregate distributions by BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo that have not been distributed by us. The reason is that the exchanging partner could receive both (1) the benefit of the distribution that has not been distributed by us that we received from BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo to BGC Holdings (in the form of a distribution by BGC Holdings to its limited partners) and (2) the benefit of the distribution from BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo to us (in the form of a subsequent cash dividend paid by us, a greater percentage indirect interest in BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo following a repurchase of BGC Class A common stock by us or a greater value of assets following a purchase of assets by us with the cash that otherwise would be distributed to our stockholders). Consequently, if our dividend policy does not match the level of the distribution policy of BGC Holdings, other holders of BGC Class A common stock and BGC Class B common stock as of the date of an exchange could experience a reduction in their interest in the profits previously distributed by BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo that have not been distributed by us. Our current dividend policy could result in distributions to our common stockholders that are different from the distributions made by BGC Holdings to its unit holders.\nIf we or BGC Holdings were deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act, the Investment Company Act\u2019s restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our businesses and structure as contemplated and could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nGenerally, an entity is deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act if it is primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and is deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act if it owns \u201cinvestment securities\u201d having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government Securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We believe that neither we nor BGC Holdings should be deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d as defined under Section 3(a)(1)(A) because neither of us is primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. Rather, through our operating subsidiaries, we and BGC Holdings are primarily engaged in the operation of various types of brokerage businesses as described in this report. Neither we nor BGC Holdings is an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under Section 3(a)(1)(C) because more than 60% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis are interests in majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves \u201cinvestment companies.\u201d In particular, our BGC brokerage subsidiaries are entitled to rely on, among other things, the broker-dealer/market intermediary exemption in Section 3(c)(2) of the Investment Company Act.\nTo ensure that we and BGC Holdings are not deemed \u201cinvestment companies\u201d under the Investment Company Act, we need to be primarily engaged, directly or indirectly, in the non-investment company businesses of our operating subsidiaries. If we were to cease participation in the management of BGC Holdings, if BGC Holdings, in turn, were to cease participation in the management of the BGC OpCos, or if the BGC OpCos, in turn, were to cease participation in the management of our BGC operating subsidiaries, that would increase the possibility that we and BGC Holdings could be deemed \u201cinvestment companies.\u201d Further, if we were deemed not to have a majority of the voting power of BGC Holdings (including through our ownership of the Special Voting Limited Partnership Interest), if BGC Holdings, in turn, were deemed not to have a majority of the voting power of the BGC OpCos (including through its ownership of Special Voting Limited Partnership Interests), or if the BGC OpCos, in turn, were deemed not to have a majority of the voting power of our BGC operating subsidiaries, that would increase the possibility that we and BGC Holdings could be deemed \u201cinvestment companies,\u201d our interests in BGC Holdings and the BGC OpCos could be deemed \u201cinvestment securities,\u201d and we and BGC Holdings could be deemed \u201cinvestment companies.\u201d\nWe expect to take all legally permissible action to ensure that we and BGC Holdings are not deemed investment companies under the Investment Company Act, but no assurance can be given that this will not occur.\nThe Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed prescriptions for the organization and operations of investment companies. Among other things, the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, limit the issuance of debt and equity securities, prohibit the issuance of stock options, and impose certain governance requirements. If anything were to happen that would cause us or BGC Holdings to be deemed to be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act, the Investment Company Act would limit our or its capital structure, ability to transact business with affiliates (including Cantor, BGC Holdings or the BGC OpCos as the case may be), and ability to compensate key employees. Therefore, if we or BGC Holdings became subject to the Investment Company Act, it could make it impractical to continue our businesses in this structure, impair agreements and arrangements, and impair the transactions contemplated by those agreements and arrangements, between and among us, BGC Holdings and the BGC OpCos, or any combination thereof, and materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Partnership and Equity-Based Compensation Structure\nOur equity-based compensation structure may adversely affect our ability to recruit, retain, compensate and motivate some employee partners.\nWhile we believe that our emphasis on equity-based compensation promotes recruitment, motivation of our brokers and other employees and alignment of interest with shareholders, such employee may be more attracted to the benefits of working at a privately controlled partnership, or at a public company with a different compensation structure than our own, which may adversely affect our ability to recruit, retain, compensate and motivate these persons. While BGC Holdings limited partnership interests entitle founding/working and other limited partners to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our businesses, upon leaving BGC Holdings (or upon any other purchase of such limited partnership interests, as described below), any such founding/working or other limited partners are, unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and us, as the general partner of BGC Holdings, otherwise determine, only entitled to receive over time, and provided he or she does not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her BGC Holdings limited partnership interests that reflects such partner\u2019s capital account or post-termination amount, if any, and not any goodwill or going concern value of our businesses. Further, certain partner units have no right to a post-termination payment, receive a preferred but fixed distribution amount, and/or cannot be made exchangeable into shares of our Class A common stock. Moreover, unless and until units are made exchangeable, limited partners have no unilateral right to exchange their BGC Holdings limited partnership interests for shares of BGC Class A common stock.\nThe BGC Holdings limited partnership interests are also subject to redemption, and subject founding/working and other limited partners to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, as well as other obligations. In addition, the exercise of Cantor\u2019s right to purchase from BGC Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests generally when FPUs are redeemed or granted exchangeability will result in the share of distributions of income from the operations of our businesses on other outstanding BGC Holdings limited partnership interests, including those held by founding/working and other limited partners, to remain the same rather than increasing as would be the case if such interests were redeemed or granted exchangeability without such Cantor right to purchase. In addition, any purchase of exchangeable limited partnership units by Cantor from BGC Holdings following Cantor\u2019s decision to grant exchangeability on FPUs will result in additional dilution to the other partners of BGC Holdings.\nThe terms of the BGC Holdings limited partnership interests held by founding/working and limited partners also provide for the following:\n\u2022\nsuch units are not entitled to reinvest the distributions on their BGC Holdings limited partnership interests in additional BGC Holdings limited partnership interests at preferential or historical prices or at all; and\n\u2022\nCantor is entitled to receive any amounts from selected extraordinary transactions that are withheld from distributions to certain partners and forfeited by partners leaving BGC Holdings prior to their interests in such withheld distributions fully vesting, rather than any such forfeited amounts accruing to the benefit of all BGC Holdings limited partners on a pro rata basis.\nIn addition, the ability to acquire shares of our Class A common stock underlying BGC Holdings exchangeable units is not dependent upon the partner\u2019s continued employment with us or compliance with partner obligations, and such partners are therefore not restricted from leaving us by the potential loss of such shares. In the event that we complete a transaction to simplify our organizational structure by restructuring our partnership into a corporation there is no assurance that the retention and motivation features of our new structure will be as beneficial as those of our partnership structure.\nWe may be required to pay Cantor for a significant portion of the tax benefit, if any, relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we claim as a result of any step up in the tax basis of the assets of BGC U.S. OpCo or BGC Global OpCo resulting from Cantor\u2019s exchanges of interests in BGC Holdings (together with, prior to the Spin-Off, interests in Newmark Holdings) for our common stock.\nCertain partnership interests in BGC Holdings may be exchanged for shares of BGC Partners common stock. In the vast majority of cases, the partnership units that become exchangeable for shares of BGC common stock are units that have been granted as compensation, and, therefore, the exchange of such units will not result in an increase in BGC\u2019s share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of\nBGC U.S. OpCo, BGC Global OpCo and/or Newmark OpCo. However, exchanges of other partnership units - including non-tax-free exchanges of units by Cantor - could result in an increase in the tax basis of such tangible and intangible assets that otherwise would not have been available, although the IRS may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge by the IRS. These increases in tax basis, if sustained, may reduce the amount of tax that BGC would otherwise be required to pay in the future. In such circumstances, the tax receivable agreement that BGC entered into with Cantor provides for the payment by BGC to Cantor of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in the U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that BGC actually realizes as a result of these increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to its entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. It is expected that BGC will benefit from the remaining 15% cash savings, if any, in income tax that we realize.\nRisks Related to our Relationship with Cantor and Its Affiliates\nWe are controlled by Cantor and Mr. Lutnick, who have potential conflicts of interest with us and may exercise their control in a way that favors their interests to our detriment.\nCantor, and Mr. Lutnick, indirectly through his control of Cantor, are each able to exercise control over our management and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our directors and determinations with respect to acquisitions and dispositions, as well as material expansions or contractions of our businesses, entry into new lines of businesses and borrowings and issuances of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock or other securities. This control is subject to the approval of our Audit Committee on those matters requiring such approval. Cantor\u2019s voting power may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us.\nCantor\u2019s and Mr. Lutnick\u2019s ability to exercise control over us could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest may arise between us and Cantor in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022\npotential acquisitions and dispositions of businesses;\n\u2022\nthe issuance, acquisition or disposition of securities by us;\n\u2022\nthe election of new or additional directors to our Board;\n\u2022\nthe payment of dividends by us (if any), distribution of profits by BGC U.S. OpCo, BGC Global OpCo and/or BGC Holdings and repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock or purchases of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, including from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners, and others;\n\u2022\nany loans to or from us or Cantor;\n\u2022\nbusiness operations or business opportunities of ours and Cantor\u2019s that would compete with the other party\u2019s business opportunities, including Cantor\u2019s and our brokerage and financial services;\n\u2022\nintellectual property matters;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations involving us;\n\u2022\nconflicts between our agency trading for primary and secondary bond sales and Cantor\u2019s investment banking bond origination business;\n\u2022\ncompetition between our and Cantor\u2019s other equity derivatives and cash equity inter-dealer brokerage businesses;\n\u2022\nthe nature, quality and pricing of administrative services to be provided to or by Cantor and/or Tower Bridge; and\n\u2022\nprovision of clearing capital pursuant to the Clearing Agreement and potential and existing loan arrangements.\nWe also expect Cantor to manage its ownership of us so that it will not be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, including by maintaining its voting power in us above a majority absent an applicable exemption from the Investment Company Act. This may result in conflicts with us, including those relating to acquisitions or offerings by us involving issuances of shares of our Class A common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of our Class A common stock, that would dilute Cantor\u2019s voting power in us.\nIn addition, Cantor has from time to time in the past and may in the future consider possible strategic realignments of its own businesses and/or of the relationships that exist between and among Cantor and its other affiliates and us. Any related-party transaction or arrangement between Cantor and its other affiliates and us is subject to the prior approval by our Audit Committee, but generally does not otherwise require the separate approval of our stockholders, and if such stockholder approval is required, Cantor may retain sufficient voting power to provide any such requisite approval without the affirmative consent of the other stockholders. There is no assurance that such consolidation or restructuring would not result in a material expense or disruption to our businesses.\nMoreover, the service of officers or partners of Cantor as our executive officers and directors, and those persons\u2019 ownership interests in and payments from Cantor and its affiliates, SPACs and similar investments or other entities, could create conflicts of interest when we and those directors or executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Cantor. Our ability to retain our key employees and the ability of certain key employees to devote adequate time and attention to us are critical to the success of our businesses, and failure to do so may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur agreements and other arrangements with Cantor may be amended upon agreement of the parties to those agreements upon approval of our Audit Committee. During the time that we are controlled by Cantor, Cantor may be able to require us to agree to amendments to these agreements. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nIn order to address potential conflicts of interest between Cantor and its representatives and us, our restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions regulating and defining the conduct of our affairs as they may involve Cantor and its representatives, and our powers, rights, duties and liabilities and those of our representatives in connection with our relationship with Cantor and its affiliates, officers, directors, general partners or employees. Our certificate of incorporation provides that no Cantor Company, as defined in our certificate of incorporation, or any of the representatives, as defined in our certificate of incorporation, of a Cantor Company will owe any fiduciary duty to, nor will any Cantor Company or any of their respective representatives be liable for breach of fiduciary duty to, us or any of our stockholders, including with respect to corporate opportunities. In addition, Cantor and its respective representatives have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar activities or lines of business as us or doing business with any of our customers. The corporate opportunity policy that is included in our certificate of incorporation is designed to resolve potential conflicts of interest between us and Cantor and its representatives.\nIf any Cantor Company or any its representatives acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity (as defined in our restated certificate of incorporation) for any such person, on the one hand, and us or any of our representatives, on the other hand, such person will have no duty to communicate or offer such corporate opportunity to us or any of our representatives, and will not be liable to us, any of our stockholders or any of our representatives for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that they pursue or acquire such corporate opportunity for themselves, direct such corporate opportunity to another person or do not present such corporate opportunity us or any of our representatives, subject to the requirement described in the following sentence. If a third party presents a corporate opportunity to a person who is both our representative and a representative of a Cantor Company, expressly and solely in such person\u2019s capacity as our representative, and such person acts in good faith in a manner consistent with the policy that such corporate opportunity belongs to us, then such person will be deemed to have fully satisfied and fulfilled any fiduciary duty that such person has to us as our representative with respect to such corporate opportunity, provided that any Cantor Company or any of its representatives may pursue such corporate opportunity if we decide not to pursue such corporate opportunity.\nThe BGC Holdings limited partnership agreement contains similar provisions with respect to us and/or Cantor and each of our respective representatives, and the BGC U.S. OpCo and BGC Global OpCo limited partnership agreements, contain similar provisions with respect to us and/or BGC Holdings and each of our respective representatives.\nThis policy, however, could make it easier for Cantor to compete with us. If Cantor competes with us, it could materially harm our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAgreements between us and Cantor are between related parties, and the terms of these agreements may be less favorable to us than those that we could have negotiated with third parties and may subject us to litigation.\nOur relationship with Cantor results in agreements with Cantor that are between related parties. As a result, the prices charged to us or by us for services provided under agreements with Cantor or sales or purchases of assets or other similar transactions may be higher or lower than prices that may be charged by third parties, and the terms of these agreements may be less favorable to us than those that we could have negotiated with third parties. In addition, Cantor has an unlimited right to internally use market data from us without any cost. Any related-party transactions or arrangements between us and Cantor are subject to the prior approval by our Audit Committee, but generally do not otherwise require the separate approval of our stockholders, and if such stockholder approval were required, Cantor may retain sufficient voting power to provide any such requisite approval without the affirmative consent of the other stockholders.\nThese related-party relationships may from time to time subject us to litigation. For example, a purported derivative action, was filed alleging the Berkeley Point Acquisition and our investment in Real Estate LP were unfair to us. While the Company believes that these allegations are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously as the case moves forward, as in any litigated matter, the outcome cannot be determined with certainty.\nWe are controlled by Cantor, which in turn controls its wholly owned subsidiary, CF&Co, which has acted and may continue to act as our sales agent in our CEO program from time to time and provides us with additional investment banking services. In addition, other affiliates of Cantor may provide us with advice and services from time to time.\nWe are controlled by Cantor, which in turn controls its wholly owned subsidiary, CF&Co, which has acted in the past and may continue to act as our sales agent in our CEO program, including pursuant to the March 2018 Sales Agreement, and received fees in connection therewith. We may enter into similar agreements in the future. Pursuant to the March 2018 Sales Agreement, we may offer and sell up to $300 million of shares of our Class A common stock. Under the March 2018 Sales Agreement, we agree to pay CF&Co 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A common stock. For certain transactions during 2020, we paid CF&Co 1% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A common stock in our CEO program. As of December 31, 2020, we have issued and sold 17.6 million shares of BGC Class A common stock (or $210.8 million) under the March 2018 Sales Agreement.\nIn selling shares of our Class A common stock under the March 2018 Sales Agreement, we may determine to instruct CF&Co not to sell our shares at less than a minimum price per share designated by us. Alternatively, we may instruct CF&Co to sell our shares so as to seek to realize a designated minimum price per share for all shares sold over a designated time period, or so as to seek to raise a designated minimum dollar amount of gross proceeds from sales of all such shares over a designated time period.\nCF&Co has retained independent legal advisors in connection with its role as sales agent under the March 2018 Sales Agreement, but for the reasons described below it may not be in a position to provide us with independent financial input in connection with the offering of shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to the March 2018 Sales Agreement. We are not required to, and have not engaged, an independent investment banking firm to act as a qualified independent underwriter or to otherwise provide us with independent input in our CEO program.\nWhile our Board and Audit Committee will be involved with any decision by us to enter into or terminate new sales agreements with CF&Co, our management has been delegated the authority to determine, and to so instruct CF&Co with respect to, matters involving the manner, timing, number of shares, and minimum prices per share or proceeds for sales of our shares, or the suspension thereof, in our CEO program pursuant to the March 2018 Sales Agreement. Our management may be expected to consult with appropriate personnel from CF&Co in making such determinations, but given the overlap between our senior management and that of Cantor and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CF&Co, it may be expected that any joint determinations by our senior management and that of CF&Co with respect to our CEO program will involve the same individuals. In making such joint determinations, our Audit Committee has instructed our senior management to act in the best interests of us and our stockholders. Nevertheless, in making such determinations, such individuals will not have the benefit of input from an independent investment banking firm that is able to make its own determinations with respect to our CEO program, including, but not limited to, whether to suspend sales under the March 2018 Sales Agreement or to terminate the March 2018 Sales Agreement.\nIn addition, Cantor, CF&Co and their affiliates have provided investment banking services to us and our affiliates in the past, and may be expected to do so in the future, including acting as our financial advisor in connection with business combinations, dispositions, or other transactions, including the acquisition of GFI, and placing or recommending to us various investments, stock loans or cash management vehicles. They receive customary fees and commissions for these services in accordance with our investment banking engagement letter with CF&Co. They may also receive brokerage and market data and analytics products and services from us and our respective affiliates. From time to time, CF&Co may make a market in our notes. We also provide to and receive from Cantor and its affiliates various administrative services.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nPurchasers, as well as existing stockholders, may experience significant dilution as a result of offerings of shares of our Class A common stock, which may occur from time to time through our CEO Program or otherwise, as well as other potential forms of employee share monetization, including issuance of shares to employees and partners which may be sold through broker transactions. Our management will have broad discretion as to the timing and amount of sales of our Class A common stock under the March 2018 Sales Agreement or in any other offering, as well as the application of the net proceeds of any such sales.\nThe March 2018 Sales Agreement with CF&Co currently remains in effect to assist us with partner and employee sales of shares of Class A common stock, which may occur from time to time, as well as other potential forms of employee share monetization including issuance of shares to employees and partners which may be sold through broker transactions. The March 2018 Sales Agreement provides for the issuance and sale of up to $300 million of shares of our Class A common stock of our Class A common stock from time to time on a delayed or continuous basis. As of December 31, 2020, we have issued and sold 17.6 million shares of BGC Class A common stock (or $210.8 million) under the March 2018 Sales Agreement. Upon the sale of the remaining amount available under the March 2018 Sales Agreement or at another time, we may enter into a new sales agreement with CF&Co.\nWe have an effective registration statement on Form S-4 filed on September 3, 2010 (the \u201c2010 Form S-4 Registration Statement\u201d), with respect to the offer and sale of up to 20 million shares of BGC Class A common stock from time to time in connection with business combination transactions, including acquisitions of other businesses, assets, properties or securities. As of December 31, 2020, we have issued an aggregate of 14.2 million shares of BGC Class A common stock under the 2010 Form S-4 Registration Statement. Additionally, on\nSeptember 13, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 (the \u201c2019 Form S-4 Registration Statement\u201d), with respect to the offer and sale of up to 20 million shares of BGC Class A common stock from time to time in connection with business combination transactions, including acquisitions of other businesses, assets, properties or securities. As of December 31, 2020, we have not issued any shares of BGC Class A common stock under the 2019 Form S-4 Registration Statement. We also have an effective shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which we can offer and sell up to 10 million shares of BGC Class A common stock under the BGC Partners, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2020, we have issued 0.7 million shares of BGC Class A common stock under the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. We have filed a number of registration statements on Form S-8 pursuant to which we have registered the shares underlying our Equity Plan. As of December 31, 2020, there were 118.5 million shares remaining for sale under such registration statements.\nBecause the sales of shares of our Class A common stock under the March 2018 Sales Agreement have been made, and any other future sales of our Class A common stock may be made, in the markets at prevailing market prices or at prices related to such prevailing market prices, the prices at which these shares have been sold and may be sold in the future will vary, and these variations may be significant. Purchasers of these shares may suffer significant dilution if the price they pay is higher than the price paid by other purchasers of shares of our Class A common stock under the March 2018 Sales Agreement and any future offerings of shares of our Class A common stock.\nOur management will have broad discretion as to the timing and amount of sales of our Class A common stock under the March 2018 Sales Agreement or in any other offering, as well as application of the net proceeds of any such sale. Accordingly, purchasers in any such offering will be relying on the judgment of our management with regard to the use of such net proceeds, and purchasers will not have the opportunity, as part of their investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. It is possible that the proceeds will be invested in a way that does not yield a favorable, or any, return for us and cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our Class A common stock, or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could dilute existing holders of our Class A common stock and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, the sale by us of any shares of our Class A common stock may decrease our existing Class A common stockholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest in us, reduce the amount of cash available per share for dividends payable on shares of our Class A common stock and diminish the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share of our Class A common stock.\nBecause we intend to use the net proceeds from any sales of shares of our Class A common stock under the March 2018 Sales Agreement from time to time, and may use the net proceeds from future offerings, for general corporate purposes, which, among other things, are expected to include repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock and purchases of BGC Holdings units or other equity interests in us or in our subsidiaries from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners, and others, and/or to replenish cash used to effect such repurchases and purchases, investors should be aware that such net proceeds will not be available for other corporate purposes, and that, depending upon the timing and prices of such repurchases of shares and purchases of units and of the sales of our shares under the March 2018 Sales Agreement and the liquidity and depth of our market, we may sell a greater aggregate number of shares, at a lower average price per share, under the March 2018 Sales Agreement than the number of shares or units repurchased or purchased, thereby increasing the aggregate number of shares and units outstanding and potentially decreasing our EPS.\nIn the event that we make any such sales, we intend to use any net proceeds of the sale of shares of BGC Class A common stock from time to time under the March 2018 Sales Agreement, and may use the net proceeds from any future offerings, for general corporate purposes, which among other things, are expected to include repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock and purchases of BGC Holdings units or other equity interests in us or in our subsidiaries, from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners, and others, and/or to replenish cash used to effect such repurchases and purchases. From January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, we repurchased an aggregate of 2 thousand shares of our Class A common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6 thousand, with a weighted-average repurchase price of $2.58 per share. During that period, we redeemed for cash an aggregate of 1.8 million limited partnership units at a weighted-average price of $3.03 per unit and an aggregate of 0.7 million founding/working partner units at a weighted-average price of $1.79 per unit. In the future, we may continue to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock and purchase partnership units from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners, and others, and these repurchases and purchases may be significant.\nWhile we believe that we can successfully manage our strategy, and that our share price may in fact increase as we increase the amount of cash available for dividends and share repurchases and unit purchases by paying a portion of the compensation of our employees in the form of partnership units and restricted stock, gradually lowering our compensation expenses for purposes of Adjusted Earnings, and lowering our long-term effective tax rate for Adjusted Earnings, there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful or that we can achieve any or all of such objectives.", "PERMNO": 87487, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "BGCP"}
