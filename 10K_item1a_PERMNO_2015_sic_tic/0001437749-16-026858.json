{"cik": "1507277", "company": "Park Sterling Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risk factors and uncertainties described below in evaluating an investment in the Company\u2019s Common Stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company, or which the Company currently deems not material, also may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business operations. The value or market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Associated With Our Growth Strategy\nWe may not be able to implement aspects of our growth strategy.\nOur growth strategy contemplates the continued expansion of our business and operations both organically and by selective acquisitions such as through the establishment or acquisition of banks and banking offices in our market areas and other markets. Implementing these aspects of our growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to successfully identify acquisition opportunities and strategic partners that will complement our operating philosophy and to successfully integrate their operations with ours, as well as generate loans and deposits of acceptable risk and expense. To successfully acquire or establish banks or banking offices, we must be able to correctly identify profitable or growing markets, as well as attract the necessary relationships and high caliber banking personnel to make these new banking offices profitable. In addition, we may not be able to identify suitable opportunities for further growth and expansion or, if we do, we may not be able to successfully integrate these new operations into our business. As consolidation of the financial services industry continues, the competition for suitable acquisition candidates may increase. We will compete with other financial services companies for acquisition opportunities, and many of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more for an acquisition than we are able or willing to pay. We can offer no assurance that we will have opportunities to acquire other financial institutions or acquire or establish any new branches or loan production offices, or that we will be able to negotiate, finance and complete any opportunities available to us. If we are unable to effectively implement our growth strategies, our business, results of operations and stock price may be materially and adversely affected.\nFuture expansion involves risks.\nThe acquisition by us of other financial institutions or parts of those institutions, or the establishment of de novo branch offices and loan production offices, involves a number of risks, including the risk that:\n\u25cf\nwe may incur substantial costs in identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners, or in evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local managers, and opening new offices;\n\u25cf\nour estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks relating to target institutions may not be accurate;\n\u25cf\nthe institutions we acquire may have distressed assets and there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the value we predict from those assets or that we will make sufficient provisions or have sufficient capital for future losses;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment, or other charges related to the institutions we acquire that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u25cf\nthere may be substantial lag-time between completing an acquisition or opening a new office and generating sufficient assets and deposits to support costs of the expansion;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to finance an acquisition, or the financing we obtain may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or result in dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u25cf\nour management\u2019s attention in negotiating a transaction and integrating the operations and personnel of the combining businesses may be diverted from our existing business and we may not be able to successfully integrate such operations and personnel;\n\u25cf\nour announcement of another transaction prior to completion of a merger could result in a delay in obtaining regulatory or shareholder approval for a merger, which could have the effect of limiting our ability to fully realize the expected financial benefits from the transaction;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition;\n\u25cf\nwe may enter new markets where we lack local experience or that introduce new risks to our operations, or that otherwise result in adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u25cf\nwe may introduce new products and services we are not equipped to manage or that introduce new risks to our operations, or that otherwise result in adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u25cf\nwe may incur intangible assets in connection with an acquisition, or the intangible assets we incur may become impaired, which results in adverse short-term effects on our results of operations;\n\u25cf\nwe may assume liabilities in connection with an acquisition, including unrecorded liabilities that are not discovered at the time of the transaction, and the repayment of those liabilities may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and stock price; or\n\u25cf\nwe may lose key employees and customers.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any banking offices that we acquire into our operations or retain the customers of those offices. If any of these risks occur in connection with our expansion efforts, it may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIt may be difficult to integrate the business of First Capital and we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of First Capital.\nIf our costs to integrate the business of First Capital into our existing operations are greater than anticipated or we are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, including cost savings and other synergies, our business could be negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key employees, loss of customers, errors or delays in systems implementation, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources.\nWe may incur losses on loans, securities and other acquired assets of First Capital that are materially greater than reflected in our preliminary fair value adjustments.\nWe accounted for the First Capital merger under the acquisition method of accounting, recording the acquired assets and liabilities of First Capital at fair value based on preliminary acquisition accounting adjustments. Under acquisition accounting, we have until one year after the merger date to finalize the fair value adjustments, meaning we may adjust the preliminary fair value estimates of First Capital\u2019s assets and liabilities based on new or updated information that provided a better estimate of the fair value at merger date.\nWe recorded at fair value all purchased credit-impaired (\u201cPCI\u201d) loans acquired in the merger based on the present value of their expected cash flows. We estimated cash flows using specific credit reviews of certain loans, quantitative credit risk, interest rate risk and prepayment risk models, and qualitative economic and environmental assessments, each of which uses assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We may not realize the estimated cash flows or fair value of these loans. In addition, although the difference between the pre-merger carrying value of PCI loans and their expected cash flows - the \u201cnonaccretable difference\u201d - is available to absorb future charge-offs, we may be required to increase our allowance for loan losses and related provision expense because of subsequent additional credit deterioration in these loans.\nWe may not be able to maintain our rate of growth, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have grown rapidly since we commenced operations in October 2006, and our business strategy contemplates continued growth, both organically and through acquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to be successful in increasing the volume of loans and deposits or in introducing new products and services at acceptable risk levels and upon acceptable terms while managing the costs and implementation risks associated with our historical or modified organic growth strategy. We may be unable to continue to increase our volume of loans and deposits or to introduce new products and services at acceptable risk levels for a variety of reasons, including an inability to maintain capital and liquidity sufficient to support continued growth. If we are successful in continuing our growth, we cannot assure you that further growth would offer the same levels of potential profitability or that we would be successful in controlling costs and maintaining asset quality. Accordingly, an inability to maintain growth, or an inability to effectively manage growth, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nNew bank office facilities and other facilities may not be profitable.\nWe may not be able to organically expand into new markets that are profitable for our franchise. The costs to start up new bank branches and loan production offices in new markets, other than through acquisitions, and the additional costs to operate these facilities would increase our noninterest expense and may decrease our earnings. It may be difficult to adequately and profitably manage our growth through the establishment of bank branches or loan production offices in new markets. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our expansion into any such new markets will successfully attract enough new business to offset the expenses of the operation of new bank branches or loan production offices. If we are not able to do so, our earnings and stock price may be negatively impacted.\nAcquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities may expose us to intangible asset risk, which could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with any acquisitions, as required by United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we will record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value, and, as such, acquisitions may result in us recording intangible assets, including deposit intangibles and goodwill. We will perform a goodwill valuation at least annually to test for goodwill impairment. Impairment testing is a two-step process that first compares the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount, and second measures impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Adverse conditions in our business climate, including a significant decline in future operating cash flows, a significant change in our stock price or market capitalization, or a deviation from our expected growth rate and performance, may significantly affect the fair value of any goodwill and may trigger impairment losses, which could be materially adverse to our results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe continued success of our growth strategy depends on our ability to identify and retain individuals with experience and relationships in the markets in which we intend to expand.\nOur growth strategy contemplates that we will continue to expand our business and operations to other markets in the Carolinas and Virginia. We intend to primarily target market areas that we believe possess attractive demographic, economic or competitive characteristics. To expand into new markets successfully, we must identify and retain experienced key management members with local expertise and relationships in these markets. Competition for qualified personnel in the markets in which we may expand may be intense, and there may be a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the commercial banking industry in these markets. Even if we identify individuals that we believe could assist us in establishing a presence in a new market, we may be unable to recruit these individuals away from other banks or be unable to do so at a reasonable cost. In addition, the process of identifying and recruiting individuals with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategy is often lengthy. Our inability to identify, recruit and retain talented personnel to manage new offices effectively would limit our growth and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nWe may need additional access to capital, which we may be unable to obtain on attractive terms or at all.\nWe may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments, for future growth or to fund losses or additional provision for loan losses in the future. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our stock price negatively affected.\nRisks Associated With Our Business\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services that we offer, is highly dependent upon the business and economic environment in the primary markets in which we operate and in the United States as a whole. Although there has been improvement in general economic conditions in the United States since the recession experienced in 2007-09, with evidence of stabilizing home prices and a reduction in unemployment levels, economic growth and business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the United States has been slow and uneven, underemployment and household debt levels remain elevated and interest rates remain historically low. There can be no assurance that that economic conditions will continue to improve, and they may worsen.\nOur business also is impacted by the domestic and international capital and credit markets, which have been experiencing volatility and disruption in recent years, resulting in uncertainty in the financial markets in general. In addition, instability in international market, economic and political conditions impacts global economic conditions, including economic recovery in the United States.\nEconomic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. A return of recessionary conditions or negative developments in global financial markets or economies may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. In particular, negative developments in our current and target markets could drive losses beyond those that are or will be provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following consequences:\n\u25cf\nincreases in loan delinquencies;\n\u25cf\nincreases in nonperforming loans and foreclosures;\n\u25cf\ndecreases in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our liquidity position;\n\u25cf\ndecreases in the value of the collateral securing loans, especially real estate, which could reduce customers\u2019 borrowing power; and\n\u25cf\ndecreases in the ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all.\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other governmental action could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur business and results of operations also are affected by fiscal and monetary policy. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board in the United States, and central banks internationally, regulate the supply of money and credit and the global financial system, impacting the cost of funds for lending, investing and capital-raising activities and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect net interest margin. The actions of monetary authorities also can affect the value of financial instruments and other assets. Changes in domestic and international fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur estimated allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The determination of the allowance for loan losses, which represents management\u2019s estimate of probable losses inherent in our credit portfolio, involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. Our policy is to establish reserves for estimated losses on delinquent and other problem loans when it is determined that losses are expected to be incurred on such loans. At December 31, 2015, our allowance for loan losses totaled approximately $9.1 million, which represented 0.52% of total loans and 109.85% of total nonperforming loans. Management\u2019s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including an evaluation of the portfolio, current economic conditions, the volume and type of lending conducted by us, composition of the portfolio, the amount of our classified assets, seasoning of the loan portfolio, the status of past due principal and interest payments and other relevant factors. Changes in such estimates may have a significant impact on our financial statements. If our assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect, our current allowance may not be sufficient and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. In addition, we may be required to increase the allowance due to the conditions of loans acquired as result of our acquisitions of financial institutions should the remaining acquisition accounting fair market value adjustments for such loans be judged inadequate relative to their estimated future performance. Federal and state regulators also periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. However, no assurance can be given that the allowance will be adequate to cover loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio, and we may experience losses in our loan portfolio or perceive adverse conditions and trends that may require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses in the future. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, which could impact our stock price.\nIf our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will suffer.\nAt December 31, 2015, our nonperforming assets totaled approximately $13.7 million, or 0.54% of total assets. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our earnings in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d). We must reserve for probable losses, which is established through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses as well write-downs from time to time, as appropriate, of the value of properties in our OREO portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our OREO. Further, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activity. Finally, if our estimate for the recorded allowance for loan losses proves to be incorrect and our allowance is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance accordingly and as a result our earnings may be adversely affected, which could impact our stock price.\nFailure to comply with the terms of the FDIC loss-share agreements acquired from Citizens South may result in significant losses.\nAs a result of our merger with Citizens South, we assumed certain FDIC loss-share agreements. Our loss-share agreement related to Bank of Hiawassee\u2019s non-single family assets expired on March 31, 2015, and on April 1, 2015, the remaining balance of $19.6 million associated with the Bank of Hiawassee non-single family loans and the remaining balance of $812 thousand associated with the Bank of Hiawassee non-single family OREO was transferred from the covered portfolio to the non-covered portfolio. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining loss-share agreements cover approximately $18.9 million (net of related fair value marks) in assets, and provide that the FDIC will reimburse us for between 80 and 95 percent of net losses on covered assets. To receive such reimbursements, we must comply with the specific, detailed and cumbersome compliance, servicing, notification and reporting requirements provided in the agreements. Our failure to comply with the terms of the agreements or to properly service the loans and OREO under the requirements of the loss-share agreements may cause individual loans or large pools of loans to lose eligibility for loss-share payments from the FDIC. This could result in material losses that are currently not anticipated.\nOur concentration in loans secured by real estate, particularly commercial real estate and construction and development, may increase our loan losses.\nWe offer a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Many of our loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in our market areas. Consequently, declines in economic conditions in these market areas may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse.\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 84% of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral, with 16% of those loans secured by construction and development collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected. Real estate values have declined significantly during the recent economic crisis. Although real estate prices in most of our markets have stabilized or are improving, a renewed decline in real estate values would expose us to further deterioration in the value of the collateral for all loans secured by real estate and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCommercial real estate loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans, particularly when there is a downturn in the business cycle. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner\u2019s business or the property to service the debt. Cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions and a downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the local economy where the property is located, each of which could increase the likelihood of default on the loan. Because our loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in the percentage of nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nBanking regulators are examining commercial real estate lending activity with heightened scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, which in turn could negatively affect our stock price.\nSince we engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral property and own the underlying real estate, we may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property, which could adversely impact our results of operations and stock price.\nSince we originate loans secured by real estate, we may have to foreclose on the collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we are exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to: general or local economic conditions; environmental cleanup liability; neighborhood values; interest rates; real estate tax rates; operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; supply of and demand for rental units or properties; ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; zoning laws; governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and acts of God. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating income-producing real property may exceed the rental income earned from such property, and we may have to advance funds in order to protect our investment or we may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss.\nWe maintain a number of large lending relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if our borrowers were not to perform according to the terms of these loans.\nOur ten largest lending relationships (including aggregate exposure to guarantors) at December 31, 2015, range from $10.4 million to $20.2 million and averaged $13.2 million. None of these lending relationships was included in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015. The deterioration of one or more large relationship loans could result in a significant increase in our nonperforming loans and our provision for loan losses, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe FDIC deposit insurance assessments that we are required to pay may increase in the future, which would have an adverse effect on our earnings.\nAs an insured depository institution, we are required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC to maintain the level of the FDIC deposit insurance reserve ratio. The recent failures of many financial institutions have significantly increased the loss provisions of the DIF, resulting in a decline in the reserve ratio. As a result of recent economic conditions and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC revised its assessment rates which raised deposit premiums for certain insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the DIF to meet its funding requirements, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. The Company is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, the FDIC may increase the deposit insurance assessment rates. Any future assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our earnings and could negatively affect our stock price.\nDeterioration in the fiscal position of the United States federal government and a downgrade of United States government securities by the credit rating agencies and Europe\u2019s debt crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe long-term outlook for the fiscal position of the United States federal government is uncertain, as illustrated by the 2011 downgrade by certain rating agencies of United States government securities. Continuing federal budget deficit concerns, including the impact on the national debt ceiling, and overall weakness in the economy could lead to additional downgrades, which could create uncertainty in the United States and global financial markets and economies. Any such adverse impact could cause other events which, directly or indirectly, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the possibility that certain European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) member states will default on their debt obligations has negatively impacted economic conditions and global markets. The continued uncertainty over the outcome of international and the EU\u2019s financial support programs and the possibility that other EU member states may experience similar financial troubles could further disrupt global markets. The negative impact on economic conditions and global markets could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur net interest income could be negatively affected by interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings are dependent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes resulting from changes in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policies, affects us more than non-financial institutions and can have a significant effect on our net interest income and total income. Our assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of our assets and liabilities. As a result, an increase or decrease in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, could have an adverse effect on our deposit levels, loan demand, business and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates by 25 basis points in December 2015 after having held interest rates at almost zero over recent years. However, the consistently low rate environment has negatively impacted our net interest margin, notwithstanding decreases in nonperforming loans and improvements in deposit mix. Any reduction in net interest income will negatively affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our securities.\nThe primary tool that management uses to measure short-term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model prepared by an independent correspondent bank. As of December 31, 2015, the Company is considered to be in a liability-sensitive position, meaning income and capital are generally expected to decrease with an increase in short-term interest rates and, conversely, to increase with a decrease in short-term interest rates. However, based on the results of this simulation model, which assumed a static environment with no contemplated asset growth or changes in our balance sheet management strategies, if short-term interest rates immediately decreased by 200 basis points, we could expect net income and capital to decrease by approximately $1.4 million over a 12-month period. This result is primarily due to the current low interest rate environment, under which interest rates on the Company\u2019s average interest-bearing liabilities cannot benefit fully from a 200 basis point rate reduction, without turning negative, while yields on our average interest-earning assets could decline by 200 basis points. Furthermore, if short-term interest rates increase by 300 basis points, simulation modeling predicts net interest income will also decline by approximately $5.0 million over a 12-month period as a result of our liability-sensitive position. The actual amount of any increase or decrease may be higher or lower than predicted by our simulation model.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and currently are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by the NC Commissioner, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, locations of offices, and the ability to accept brokered deposits. We must also meet regulatory capital requirements. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity, deposit funding strategy and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Our failure to remain well capitalized and well managed for regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, the ability to execute our business strategies, the ability to grow our assets or establish new branches, the ability to obtain or renew brokered deposits, our cost of funds and FDIC insurance, the ability to pay dividends on or repurchase shares of our Common Stock and the ability to make acquisitions.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time, and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. For example, new legislation or regulation could limit the manner in which we may conduct our business, including our ability to obtain financing, attract deposits and make loans. Many of these regulations are intended to protect depositors, the public and the FDIC, not shareholders. In addition, the burden imposed by these regulations may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors who are less regulated. The laws, regulations, interpretations and enforcement policies that apply to us have been subject to significant change in recent years, sometimes retroactively applied, and may change significantly in the future.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial-services industry, including new or revised regulation of such things as systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments and consumer financial protection. The federal banking regulators have adopted new regulatory capital rules applicable to United States banking organizations. Complying with these and other new legislative or regulatory requirements, and any programs established thereunder, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we have to record an other-than-temporary-impairment in connection with our collateralized loan obligations (\u201cCLOs\u201d) as a result of the Volcker Rule, it could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nThe Volcker Rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring a covered fund (such as a hedge fund and or private equity fund). At December 31, 2015, we held one investment in a senior tranche of CLO totaling $5.0 million, with a net unrealized loss of $57,300, which currently would be prohibited under the Volcker Rule. Unless the CLO documentation is amended to avoid inclusion within the rule\u2019s prohibitions, we would have to recognize write-downs of these securities, by recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) in conformity with GAAP rules, and sell these securities before July 2017 assuming the date for conformity with the Volcker Rule is extended from July 2016. As we approach July 2017, the price of these securities could be negatively impacted as many holders of these and similar instruments will be forced to liquidate their positions. Any OTTI charges could significantly impact our earnings.\nOur success depends significantly on economic conditions in our market areas.\nUnlike larger organizations that are more geographically diversified, our banking offices are currently concentrated in North Carolina, South Carolina, North Georgia, and Richmond, Virginia, and we expect that our banking offices will remain primarily concentrated in North Carolina, South Carolina, North Georgia and Virginia. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results will depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions, locally or nationally, deteriorate, this may have a significant impact on the amount of loans that we originate, the ability of our borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A return to economic downturn conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, government action or other factors beyond our control would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio and reduce our level of deposits, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, some portions of our target market are in coastal areas, which are susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms. Such weather events can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, decrease the value of real estate collateral for our loans and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future hurricanes or other weather events will affect our operations or the economies in our market areas, but such weather events could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in delinquencies, foreclosures and loan losses. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of hurricanes or other significant weather events.\nIf we lose key employees, our business may suffer.\nOur operating results and ability to adequately manage our growth and minimize loan losses is highly dependent on the services, managerial abilities and performance of our current executive officers and other key personnel, many of whom have significant local experience and contacts within our market areas. If we lose key employees temporarily or permanently, this could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nTo be profitable, we must compete successfully with other financial institutions that have greater resources and capabilities than we do.\nThe banking business in our target markets is highly competitive. Many of our existing and potential competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do and have been in existence a longer period of time. We compete with these institutions in both attracting deposits and originating loans. We may not be able to attract customers away from our competition. We compete for loans and deposits with other commercial banks; savings banks; thrifts; trust companies; credit unions; securities brokerage firms; mortgage brokers; insurance companies; mutual funds; and industrial loan companies.\nCompetitors that are not depository institutions are generally not regulated as extensively as we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Other competitors are subject to similar regulation but have the advantages of larger established customer bases, higher lending limits, extensive branch networks, greater advertising and marketing budgets or other factors.\nOur legal lending limit is determined by law and is calculated as a percentage of our capital and unimpaired surplus. The size of the loans that we are able to offer to our customers is less than the size of the loans that larger competitors are able to offer. This limit may affect our success in establishing relationships with the larger businesses in our market. We may not be able to successfully compete with the larger banks in our target markets.\nOur liquidity needs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur primary sources of funds are deposits and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, availability of, and/or access to, sources of refinancing, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters and international instability. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, regulatory capital requirements, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Accordingly, we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include FHLB advances, sales of securities and loans, federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks and borrowings from the Federal Reserve Discount Window, as well as additional out-of-market time deposits and brokered deposits. While we believe that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands, particularly if we continue to grow and experience increasing loan demand. We may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets should such sources not be adequate.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties, which, if incorrect or incomplete, could harm our earnings.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers, counterparties or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to customers, we may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform to GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate, underwrite and service loans. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers, fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner, or rely on information provided to us, such as financial statements that do not comply with GAAP and may be materially misleading.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems in the past and could lead to losses or defaults by us or other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or customer. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our operations. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action and adversely impact our results of operations. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our customers and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of our business.\nWe are subject to security and operational risks including risks relating to our use of technology that, if not managed properly, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. Any such failure also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions, and while we have not experienced any denial of service attacks or breaches of client data, we could be the victim of such attacks or breaches in the future, which could be disruptive and damaging. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm.\nTo conduct our business, we rely heavily on technology-driven products and services and on communications and information systems. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address our customers\u2019 needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to the physical infrastructure and systems that support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant and widespread disruption to our infrastructure or systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, check processing, electronic funds transfer, loan processing, online banking, mobile banking, automated teller machines (\u201cATMs\u201d) backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts, and cyber attacks. We continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers and other external parties. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks. We rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct our operations, as well as on the honesty and integrity of our employees and vendors with access to those elements. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use computers, personal smartphones, tablet PCs, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, networks, and our customers\u2019 devices may be subject to, or the target of, cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations.\nWe also face the risk of unauthorized activity, fraud or theft by our employees and/or vendors that could result in disclosure or misuse of our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary or other information. In addition, we face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate transactions. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our customers, manage our exposure to risk or expand our business and could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses related to cyber attacks or other information security breaches. Cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe may issue additional shares of stock or equity derivative securities, including awards to current and future executive officers, directors and employees, which could result in the dilution of shareholders\u2019 investment.\nOur authorized capital includes 200,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2015, we had 44,854,509 shares of Common Stock outstanding, including approximately 959,305 shares that have voting rights but no economic interest related to unvested shares of restricted stock and had reserved or otherwise set aside for issuance 2,094,493 shares underlying outstanding options and 641,870 shares that are available for future grants of stock options, restricted stock or other equity-based awards pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Subject to NASDAQ rules, our board of directors generally has the authority to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or preferred stock for any corporate purpose. We anticipate that we will issue additional equity in connection with the acquisition of other strategic partners and that in the future we likely will seek additional equity capital as we develop our business and expand our operations, depending on the timing and magnitude of any particular future acquisition. These issuances would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of the Common Stock. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, our then existing shareholders.\nIn addition, the issuance of shares under our equity compensation plans will result in dilution of our shareholders\u2019 ownership of our Common Stock. The exercise price of stock options could also adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional capital. Option holders are most likely to exercise their options when the exercise price is less than the market price for our Common Stock. They may profit from any increase in the stock price without assuming the risks of ownership of the underlying shares of Common Stock by exercising their options and selling the stock immediately.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in losses to our investors and litigation against us.\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate in the future. These factors include, but are not limited to actual or anticipated variations in earnings, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections, our announcement of developments related to our businesses, operations and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers, new technology used or services offered by traditional and nontraditional competitors, news reports of trends and concerns and other issues related to the financial services industry. Fluctuations in our stock price may be unrelated to our performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector, could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell our Common Stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Moreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of fluctuation in the market price of their securities. We could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our normal business, which could result in losses to investors.\nFuture sales of our Common Stock by shareholders or the perception that those sales could occur may cause our Common Stock price to decline.\nAlthough our Common Stock is listed for trading on NASDAQ, the trading volume in the Common Stock may be lower than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the Common Stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the potential for lower relative trading volume in the Common Stock, significant sales of the Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of those sales or perceptions.\nState laws and provisions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws could make it more difficult for another company to purchase us, even though such a purchase may increase shareholder value.\nIn many cases, shareholders may receive a premium for their shares if we were purchased by another company. State law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult for anyone to purchase us without approval of our board of directors. For example, our articles of incorporation divide our board of directors into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms with approximately one-third of the board of directors elected at each annual meeting of shareholders. This classification of directors makes it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board of directors. As a result, at least two annual meetings of shareholders would be required for the shareholders to change a majority of directors, whether or not a change in the board of directors would be beneficial and whether or not a majority of shareholders believe that such a change would be desirable.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited and we may be unable to pay future dividends.\nOur board of directors initiated payment of cash dividends in 2013. However, any future declaration of dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, regulatory restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We make no assurances that we will pay any dividends in the future. The holders of our Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends only when and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. As part of our consideration to pay cash dividends, we intend to retain adequate funds from future earnings to support the development and growth of our business.\nMoreover, we are a bank holding company that is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. As a result, our ability to make dividend payments, if any, on our Common Stock depends primarily upon receipt of dividends and other distributions received from the Bank. Various federal and state regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to us and that we may pay to our shareholders. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs and financial condition. In addition, our right to participate in, and thus the ability of our shareholders to benefit indirectly from, any distribution of assets of the Bank or any other subsidiary we may have from time to time upon the subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or otherwise, will be subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary, except to the extent any of our claims as a creditor of the subsidiary may be recognized. As a result, our Common Stock effectively will be subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of the Bank and any other subsidiaries we may have.\nYour right to receive liquidation and dividend payments on our Common Stock is junior to our existing and future indebtedness and to any other senior securities we may issue in the future.\nShares of our Common Stock are equity interests in the Company and do not constitute indebtedness. This means that shares of our Common Stock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and to other nonequity claims against us and our assets available to satisfy claims against us, including in our liquidation. As of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding approximately $30.0 million under a senior loan facility and approximately $24.3 million (excluding acquisition accounting fair market value adjustments) aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated debt which, in addition to our other liabilities, would be senior in right of payment to our Common Stock. We also may incur additional indebtedness from time to time without the approval of the holders of our Common Stock.\nOur common shareholders also are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any preferred stock outstanding from time to time. Our board of directors is authorized to issue classes or series of preferred stock in the future without any action on the part of our common shareholders.\nOur Common Stock is not insured by the FDIC.\nOur Common Stock is not a savings or deposit account, and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency and is subject to risk, including the possible loss of all or some principal.", "PERMNO": 12088, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PSTB"}
