{"cik": "1555074", "company": "Altisource Asset Management Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. We consider the risks faced by Residential to be our risks because we rely on the performance of Residential to determine our incentive management fee payments and result of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history. If we are unable to implement our business strategy as planned, we will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe commenced operations approximately three years ago, and our business model is relatively untested and evolving. Businesses like ours that have a limited operating history present substantial business and financial risks and may suffer significant losses. As a result we cannot predict our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results for\n(table of contents)\nprior periods are not necessarily indicative of our results for any future period, and we may not have sufficient additional capital to implement our business model. There can be no assurance that our business will remain profitable or that it will be sustainable. The earnings potential of our proposed business is unproven, and the absence of an operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects. We may not be able to implement our business strategy as planned, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe are operating under a new asset management agreement with Residential that substantially changes the fee structure in which we earn fees; failure of Residential to achieve desired results could result in drastically reduced fees to us would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn March 2015, we entered into the New AMA with Residential. The New AMA, which became effective on April 1, 2015, provides for a new management fee structure, which replaces the incentive fee structure under the Original AMA as described under \u201cItem 1. Business - Asset Management Agreement.\u201d The three components of the fee structure are the Base Management Fee, which ranges from 1.5% to 2.0% of Residential\u2019s invested capital (as defined in the New AMA), the Conversion Fee, which is 1.5% of the market value of the single-family homes leased by Residential for the first time during the quarter, and the Incentive Management Fee, which ranges from 20% to 25% of the amount by which Residential\u2019s return on invested capital (based on AFFO as defined in the New AMA) exceeds an annual hurdle return rate of between 7.0% and 8.25% (depending on the 10-year treasury rate). To the extent Residential has an aggregate shortfall in its return rate over the previous seven quarters, that aggregate return rate shortfall gets added to the normal quarterly 1.75% return hurdle for the next quarter before we are entitled to an Incentive Management Fee.\nSince the effective date of the New AMA, we have not yet earned any Incentive Management Fees because Residential has not achieved a return in invested capital of greater than 1.75% in any quarter since April 1, 2015. In addition, since Residential\u2019s performance has resulted in shortfalls of the 1.75% return on invested capital for the past three quarters, those shortfalls have been added to the return on invested capital Residential must achieve before entitling us to an Incentive Management Fee. We cannot be certain as to if, or when, we will earn an Incentive Management Fee under the New AMA. If Residential is unable to achieve a return on capital that entitles us to earn an Incentive Management Fee, our operating results and financial condition would be significantly limited, which absent additional new revenue streams, could materially and adversely affect us.\nResidential is our primary client and we are primarily reliant on Residential to generate our revenues. A loss of Residential as a client and/or our inability to obtain or develop new clients would materially adversely affect us.\nResidential currently is our primary customer. The loss of this key customer or its failure to pay us would adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Despite Residential\u2019s or our efforts, Residential may fail to substantially grow or have adverse financial performance for a number of reasons including, without limitation, failure to maintain adequate liquidity, an inability to grow through equity offerings and/or debt facilities, generation if poor or inadequate returns, or an inability to, or substantial delays in growing or monetizing its portfolio. Under the New AMA, neither party is entitled to terminate the New AMA prior to the end of the initial term or each renewal term. However, Residential has the ability to terminate us (a) \u201cfor cause\u201d for certain events such as a material breach of the New AMA and failure to cure such breach, (b) for certain other reasons such as its failure to achieve a return on invested capital of at least 7.0% for two consecutive fiscal years after the third anniversary of the New AMA or (c) in connection with certain change of control events. There can be no assurance that Residential will not be able to terminate us prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term, particularly after April 2018, if Residential\u2019s results do not achieve the required returns in two consecutive years. Residential may also make a decision to abandon the single-family rental business, which may have the constructive effect of terminating the agreement or drastically reducing our fees under the New AMA.\nWe may not be able to obtain or develop additional clients on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to attract, develop and/or maintain additional clients may depend, in large part, on the success of Residential under our management and our ability to continue to develop and implement Residential\u2019s business plan profitably and enable Residential to maintain and grow its shareholder returns and dividends. We may be unable to reduce our reliance on Residential for incentive management fees and our failure to do so could materially adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition and could adversely affect our ability to attract additional clients and the sustainability of our business model.\nThe success of our business is dependent on Residential and its ongoing access to sufficient and cost-effective sources of capital.\nResidential commenced operations approximately two years ago and may require additional working capital to implement its investment strategies. Residential may need to utilize a variety of funding sources to provide sufficient capital to effectively\n(table of contents)\ncarry out its business plan over the long-term. We will have significant responsibilities in advising Residential on its capital raising activities. Our success is dependent on Residential's ability to obtain such capital. Residential utilizes various sources of liquidity including without limitation accessing the capital markets to issue debt or equity securities, engaging in collateralized or other borrowings including repurchase agreements and warehouse facilities from third party banks or entering into securitization transactions, all or any of which may not be available or have terms that are not cost-effective, therefore having an adverse impact on Residential's financial performance. Residential currently is our primary customer. The loss of this key customer or its failure to pay us would adversely affect our revenues, results of operation, financial condition. We may not be able to obtain additional clients on acceptable terms or at all. Therefore, we may be unable to reduce our reliance on Residential for incentive management fees.\nThe asset management business is intensely competitive.\nThe asset management business is intensely competitive, driven by a variety of factors including asset performance, the quality of service provided to clients, brand recognition and business reputation. Our asset management business competes with a number of other asset managers. A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:\n\u2022\na number of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do;\n\u2022\nour clients may not perform as well as the clients of our competitors;\n\u2022\nseveral of our competitors and their clients have significant amounts of capital and many of them have similar management objectives to ours which may create additional competition for management opportunities;\n\u2022\nsome of these competitors' clients may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to our clients which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to funding opportunities;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors' clients may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds which could allow them to facilitate the acquisition and management by their clients of a wider variety of assets and allow them to advise their clients to bid more aggressively than our clients for assets on which we would advise our clients to bid;\n\u2022\nthere are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new asset management firms, and the successful efforts of new entrants into the asset management business is expected to continue to result in increased competition;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by potential clients as having better expertise with regard to specific assets and\n\u2022\nother industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit members of our management team and other employees away from us.\nSuboptimal economics of real estate related insurance activities, or a failure to commence and/or grow the business of NewSource could adversely impact our investment in NewSource.\nWe invested $2.0 million in 100% of the common stock of NewSource during 2013, and we invested an additional $5.0 million in 2015. Despite the commencement in 2014 of NewSource\u2019s title reinsurance business operations, NewSource determined that the economics of the initial business activities did not warrant the continuation of its initial reinsurance quota share agreement with an unrelated third party. NewSource therefore transferred all of the risk of claims and future losses underwritten to an unrelated third party for a price of $3.2 million.\nNewSource is continuing to evaluate its real estate related insurance and reinsurance strategy and considering related opportunities. There is no assurance that NewSource will be able to develop or grow its business strategy or operations, or engage in insurance and reinsurance activities at all. In any such event, the business model for NewSource would become challenged or the growth of NewSource would become hampered, which would adversely affect the economics of our investment in NewSource and /or generate stockholder returns to us.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we will be subject following the separation date.\nWe are directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. To comply with these requirements, we may need to implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting and finance staff. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these requirements, and these expenses may be significant. If we are unable to implement additional controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial\n(table of contents)\nreporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In the future, we may also be required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and will require a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we concluded that certain material weaknesses existed as of December 31, 2014. Specifically, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to (1) the review of the BPOs used to record real estate owned and real estate assets held for sale, including monitoring the internal controls that are in place at third party vendors that we use to provide fair value information for individual properties, and (2) the review of assumptions used to determine the fair value of mortgage loans.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2015, we have not yet fully remediated the material weakness relating to the review of assumptions used to determine the fair value of mortgage loans. We are currently in the process of designing, documenting and implementing additional control procedures to remediate this material weakness. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future, we could be required to restate our financial results or experience a decline in the price of our securities.\nOur success depends on our senior management team, and if we are not able to retain them, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are highly dependent upon the continued services and experience of our senior management team. We depend on the services of members of our senior management team to, among other things, continue the development and implementation of our growth strategies and maintain and develop our client relationships. In the event that, for any reason, we are unable to retain our key personnel, it may be difficult for us to secure suitable replacements on acceptable terms. This would adversely impact the development and implementation of our growth strategies.\nThe continuing unpredictability of the credit markets may restrict our access to capital and may make it difficult or impossible for us to obtain any required additional financing.\nThe domestic and international credit markets continue to be unpredictable. In the event that we need additional capital for our business, we may have a difficult time obtaining it and/or the terms upon which we can obtain it would have an adverse impact on our financial performance.\nOur business could be significantly impacted if we suffer failure or disruptions of our information systems.\nWe rely heavily on communications, data processing and other information processing systems to conduct our business and support our day-to-day activities, most services of which are provided through Altisource. Thus, our business requires the continued operation of Altisource's sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. These systems are vulnerable to interruption by fire, loss, system malfunction and other events which are beyond our control. Systems interruptions could reduce our ability to provide our services and could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\n(table of contents)\nFailure to retain the tax benefits provided by the United States Virgin Islands would adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the United States Virgin Islands and are headquartered in Frederiksted, in the United States Virgin Islands. The United States Virgin Islands has an Economic Development Commission, which we refer to as the \u201cEDC,\u201d that provides benefits, which we refer to as \u201cEDC Benefits,\u201d to certain qualified businesses in Frederiksted that enable us to avail ourselves of significant tax benefits for a thirty year period. We received our certificate to operate as a company that qualifies for EDC Benefits as of February 1, 2013, which provides us with a 90% credit on our taxes so long as we comply with the requirements of the EDC and our certificate of benefits. It is possible that we may not be able to retain our qualifications for the EDC Benefits or that changes in U.S. federal, state, local, territorial or United States Virgin Islands taxation statutes or applicable regulations may cause a reduction in or an elimination of the EDC Benefits, all of which could result in a significant increase to our tax expense, and, therefore, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to United States federal income taxation.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the United States Virgin Islands and intend to operate in a manner that will cause us to be treated as not engaging in a trade or business within the United States which will cause us to be exempt from current United States federal income taxation on our net income. However, because there are no definitive standards provided by the Code, regulations or court decisions as to the specific activities that constitute being engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, and as any such determination is essentially factual in nature, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not successfully assert that we are engaged in a trade or business within the United States.\nIf the IRS were to successfully assert that we have been engaged in a trade or business within the United States in any taxable year, various adverse tax consequences could result including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may become subject to current United States federal income taxation on our net income from sources within the United States;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to United States federal income tax on a portion of our net investment income, regardless of its source;\n\u2022\nwe may not be entitled to deduct certain expenses that would otherwise be deductible from the income subject to United States taxation and\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to United States branch profits tax on profits deemed to have been distributed out of the United States.\nUnited States persons who own shares may be subject to United States federal income taxation on our undistributed earnings and may recognize ordinary income upon disposition of shares.\nSignificant potential adverse United States federal income tax consequences generally apply to any United States person who owns shares in a passive foreign investment company which we refer to as a \u201cPFIC.\u201d We cannot provide assurance that we will not be a PFIC in any future taxable year.\nIn general, we would be a PFIC for a taxable year if either (i) 75% or more of its income constitutes \u201cpassive income\u201d or (ii) 50% or more of our assets produce \u201cpassive income.\u201d Passive income generally includes interest, dividends and other investment income. We believe that we are currently operating and intend to continue operating our business in a way that should not cause us to be a deemed PFIC, although we cannot assure you the IRS will not successfully challenge this conclusion.\nUnited States persons who, directly or indirectly or through attribution rules, own 10% or more of our shares which we refer to as United States 10% shareholders, may be subject to the controlled foreign corporation, which we refer to as \u201cCFC,\u201d rules. Under the CFC rules, each United States 10% shareholder must annually include his pro rata share of the CFC's \u201csubpart F income,\u201d even if no distributions are made. In general, with respect to insurance revenues related to NewSource, we will be treated as a CFC only if United States 10% shareholders collectively own more than 25% of the total combined voting power or total value of our shares for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during any year. With respect to all other revenues, we will be treated as a CFC only if United States 10% shareholders collectively own more than 50% of the total combined voting power or total value of our shares for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during any year. We believe that the dispersion of our ordinary shares among holders will generally prevent shareholders who acquire shares from being United States 10% shareholders. We cannot assure you, however, that these rules will not apply to you. If you are a United States person, we strongly urge you to consult your own tax adviser concerning the CFC rules.\n(table of contents)\nUnited States tax-exempt organizations who own shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income.\nIf you are a United States tax-exempt organization you may recognize unrelated business taxable income with respect to our insurance-related income if a portion of our subpart F income is allocated to you. In general, subpart F income will be allocated to you if we are a CFC and you are a United States 10% shareholder and certain exceptions do not apply. In general, with respect to insurance revenues related to NewSource, we will be treated as a CFC only if United States 10% shareholders collectively own more than 25% of the total combined voting power or total value of our shares for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during any year. Although we do not believe that any United States persons will be allocated subpart F income, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. If you are a United States tax-exempt organization, we advise you to consult your own tax adviser regarding the risk of recognizing unrelated business taxable income.\nChange in United States tax laws may be retroactive and could subject us, and/or United States persons who own shares to United States income taxation on our undistributed earnings.\nThe tax laws and interpretations regarding whether we are engaged in a United States trade or business, are a CFC or a PFIC are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be forthcoming from the IRS. We are not able to predict if, when or in what form such guidance will be provided and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect.\nThe impact of the initiative of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in the United States Virgin Islands.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non-member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition. These measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world. While the United States Virgin Islands is currently a jurisdiction that has substantially implemented internationally agreed tax standards, we are not able to predict if additional requirements will be imposed and if so whether changes arising from such additional requirements will subject us to additional taxes.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nWe and Residential maintain our cash and cash equivalent investments and our restricted cash at financial or other intermediary institutions. The combined account balances at each institution typically exceed FDIC insurance coverage of $250,000 per depositor and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. At December 31, 2015, we and Residential had an aggregate of approximately $204.1 million at financial institutions in excess of FDIC insured limits. Any event that would cause a material portion of our and/or Residential\u2019s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at financial institutions to be uninsured by the FDIC could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks to Us Related to Residential\u2019s Business Risks and Operating Performance\nInitially, Residential is our primary source of revenue and will drive our potential future growth. Any risk associated with Residential's business that would adversely affect its ability to generate revenue and pay distributions to its shareholders is a risk to our business, as our revenues, results of operations and financial condition significantly depend upon the incentive management fees paid to us as a percentage of Residential's cash available for distribution to its shareholders. Any risk that ultimately adversely affects Residential would adversely affect the revenues we can generate, as well as our results of operations and financial condition. The risks related to Residential\u2019s business are provided below.\nResidential has a limited operating history. If Residential is unable to implement its business strategy as planned, it will be materially and adversely affected.\nResidential commenced operations approximately three years ago and its business model is relatively untested. Businesses like Residential\u2019s that have a limited operating history present substantial business and financial risks and may suffer significant losses. As a result we cannot predict Residential\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Residential only began to generate residential rental revenue during 2013, and its historical financial results have been largely attributable to purchasing residential mortgage loans and other rental-related assets at a discount. As a result of the changes to its acquisition strategy and its diversified approach of acquiring single-family rental properties directly, Residential did not complete any\n(table of contents)\nresidential mortgage loan portfolio acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015. While it intends to continue to review and assess the acquisition of portfolios of residential mortgage loans, Residential may not pursue further acquisitions of such loans. Further, there can be no assurance that Residential will be able to identify and successfully acquire portfolios of single-family rental properties or related assets on favorable terms or at all.\nWe anticipate significant growth in Residential's rental portfolio, which may result in our inability to effectively manage its rental portfolio, including, but not limited to, delays in renovations, poor tenant selection and other operational inefficiencies that could reduce Residential's profitability or damage its reputation. Generally, we expect that Residential's single-family rental portfolios may grow at an uneven pace, if at all, as opportunities to acquire single-family rental portfolios on acceptable terms may be irregularly timed and may involve large or small portfolios of single-family rental properties. The timing and extent of Residential's success in acquiring such assets cannot be predicted due to market conditions, limited financial resources or other constraints.\nCommencing in the third quarter of 2015, Residential began to package and sell portfolios of non-performing loans to unaffiliated third parties. Residential will continue to evaluate the opportunistic sale of additional portfolios of non-performing loans in the future. The timing and extent of Residential's success in selling such assets on acceptable terms or at all cannot be predicted due to market conditions, including the demand for residential mortgage loans. It is anticipated that the proceeds generated from such transactions will be utilized, in part, to facilitate Residential's strategy to purchase single-family residential properties either in bulk or on a one-by-one basis. Residential's inability to sell portfolios of residential mortgage loans on acceptable terms and/or in accordance with its preferred timing could potentially cause a strain on its liquidity, and Residential may be forced to reduce prices, continue to hold such residential mortgage loans at less than ideal leverage ratios and/or bear other costs, which could materially and adversely affect Residential's financial condition and its ability to make further acquisitions.\nThe success of Residential's loan resolution efforts remains an important aspect of its business. It could take longer than originally expected, and therefore be more costly, for a significant portion of loans in any given portfolio to be converted into single-family rental properties or an underlying property to be liquidated or sold. Accordingly, if Residential is not able to generate sufficient cash flows from its loan modification and refinancing or other activities, it may not have cash available for distribution to its stockholders for an extended period of time.\nAs a result of the foregoing developments, results from prior periods are not necessarily indicative of Residential's results for any future period, and Residential may not have sufficient additional capital to implement its business model. There can be no assurance that Residential's business will remain profitable or that its profitability will be sustainable. The earnings potential of Residential's business is unproven, and its limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate Residential's prospects. Residential may not be able to implement its business strategy as planned, which could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nResidential's business could be negatively affected as a result of shareholder activism, which could cause it to incur significant expense, hinder execution of its business strategy and impact the trading value of the its securities.\nActivist shareholders are currently publicly advocating for certain governance and strategic changes at Residential, and there is no assurance that such efforts will not be successful or that Residential will not be subject to additional shareholder activity or demands in the future. Shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors, potentially interfering with Residential's ability to execute its strategic plan. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to Residential's future direction and adversely affect its relationships with key business partners. Also, Residential may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect Residential's business and operating results. Further, the market price of Residential's common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties described above.\n(table of contents)\nResidential is operating in an emerging industry, and the long-term viability of its investment strategy on an institutional scale is unproven.\nLarge-scale institutional investment in single-family residential homes for rent is a relatively recent phenomenon that has emerged out of the mortgage and housing crisis that began in late 2007. Prior to that time, single-family rental homes were generally not viewed as viable assets for investment on a large scale by institutional investors. Consequently, the long-term viability of the single-family rental property investment strategy on an institutional scale has not yet been proven. As a participant in this emerging industry, Residential is subject to the risk that single-family rental properties may not prove to be a viable long-term investment strategy for a permanent capital vehicle on an institutional scale. If it turns out that this investment strategy is not a viable one, Residential would be materially and adversely affected and may not be able to sustain the growth of its assets and operations that it seeks.\nResidential's failure to raise equity capital and/or obtain adequate debt financing could adversely affect its ability to increase its portfolio, manage its existing assets and generate shareholder returns.\nResidential's success has been, may continue to be, largely dependent on its ability to raise equity capital and obtain debt financing to increase its rental portfolio, manage its existing assets and generate attractive stockholder returns. Residential requires significant financial resources and relies heavily on cost-effective leverage to maintain its obligations under its debt facilities and to continue to acquire portfolios of single-family residential properties and residential mortgage loans. If Residential is unable to continue to raise equity capital, or leverage its portfolio through repurchase facilities and/or securitizations, its current portfolio and cash from operations may become inadequate to meet its financial obligations.\nResidential uses leverage as a component of its financing strategy in an effort to enhance its returns. We can provide no assurance that Residential will be able to timely access all funds available under its financing arrangements or obtain other debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all. To qualify as a REIT, Residential will be required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, each year to its stockholders. As a result, Residential's ability to retain earnings to support its financing activity and fund acquisitions, property renovations or other capital expenditures will be limited.\nLimited availability of credit may have an adverse effect on Residential's ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, thereby increasing financing costs and/or requiring Residential to accept financing with increasing restrictions. Residential's long-term ability to grow through additional investments will be limited if it cannot obtain additional debt or equity financing, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nResidential may not be able to successfully operate its business or generate sufficient operating cash flows to make or sustain distributions to its stockholders.\nThere can be no assurance that Residential will be able to successfully operate its business or generate sufficient cash to make distributions to its stockholders. Residential's ability to make or sustain distributions to its stockholders depends on many factors, including the following: the availability of attractive risk-adjusted investment opportunities that satisfy its investment strategy and its success in identifying and consummating such opportunities on favorable terms; its ability to sell residential mortgage loans on favorable terms, or at all; the success of its loan resolution efforts; the ability of borrowers to refinance its loans with other lenders; its ability to sell modified loans on favorable terms; the availability of short-term and long-term financing on favorable terms; the length of time required to convert a distressed loan into a single-family rental property; the level and expected movement of home prices; the occupancy rates and rent levels of properties; the restoration, maintenance, marketing and other operating costs; our ability to effectively manage a significant increase in the number of properties in its single-family rental portfolio; the level and volatility of interest rates, conditions in the financial, real estate, housing and mortgage markets and the economy, as to which no assurance can be given. We cannot assure you that Residential will be able to make investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns or will not seek investments with greater risk to obtain the same level of returns or that the value of its investments in the future will not decline substantially. Existing and future government regulations may result in additional costs or delays, which could adversely affect the implementation of Residential's investment strategy, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n(table of contents)\nResidential has leveraged its investments and expects to continue to do so, which may materially and adversely affect its return on investments and may reduce cash available for distribution to Residential's stockholders.\nTo the extent available, we intend to continue to leverage Residential's investments through borrowings, the level of which may vary based on the particular characteristics of Residential's investment portfolio and on market conditions. We have leveraged certain of Residential's investments to date through its repurchase agreements. When Residential enters into any repurchase agreement, it may sells securities, residential mortgage loans or residential properties to lenders (i.e., repurchase agreement counterparties) and receives cash from the lenders. The lenders are obligated to resell the same assets back to Residential at the end of the term of the transaction. Because the cash Residential receives from the lender when it initially sells the assets to the lender is less than the value of those assets, if the lender defaults on its obligation to resell the same assets back to Residential, it could incur a loss on the transaction. In addition, repurchase agreements generally allow the counterparties, to varying degrees, to determine a new market value of the collateral to reflect current market conditions or for other reasons. If such counterparty determines that the value of the collateral has decreased, it may initiate a margin call and require Residential to either post additional collateral to cover such decrease or repay a portion of the outstanding borrowing. Should this occur, in order to obtain cash to satisfy a margin call, Residential may be required to liquidate assets at a disadvantageous time, which could cause it to incur further losses. In the event Residential is unable to satisfy a margin call, its counterparty may sell the collateral, which may result in significant losses to Residential. Residential's repurchase agreements generally require it to comply with various financial covenants, including those relating to tangible net worth, profitability and its ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth, and to maintain minimum amounts of cash or cash equivalents sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position. We expect any future repurchase agreements or other financing arrangements will have similar provisions. In the event that Residential is unable to satisfy these requirements, it could be forced to sell additional investments at a loss which could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nResidential's repurchase agreements to finance sub-performing and non-performing loans are complex and difficult to manage. In part, this is due to the fact that the residential mortgage loan portfolios and single-family rental properties that will collateralize these repurchase agreements do not produce consistent cash flows and require specific activities to be performed at specific points in time in order to preserve value. Residential's inability to comply with the terms and conditions of these agreements could materially and adversely impact it. In addition, Residential's outstanding repurchase agreements contain, and we expect any future repurchase agreements will contain, events of default, including payment defaults, substantial margin calls, breaches of financial and other covenants and/or certain representations and warranties, cross-defaults, servicer termination events, guarantor defaults, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and other events of default customary for these types of agreements. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for these types of agreements and include the acceleration of the outstanding principal amount, requirements that Residential repurchase a portion or all of the collateral, the liquidation by the lender of the assets then subject to the agreements and the avoidance of other repurchase transactions with Residential. Because Residential's financing agreements will typically contain cross-default provisions, a default that occurs under any one agreement could allow the lenders under its other agreements to also declare a default. Any losses Residential incurs on its repurchase agreements could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nResidential has utilized repurchase facilities and securitization transactions to finance its portfolio and may in the future utilize other sources of borrowings, including bank credit facilities, warehouse lines of credit and structured financing arrangements, among others, each of which has similar risks to repurchase agreement financing and securitizations, including, but not limited to, covenant compliance, events of default, acceleration and margin calls. The percentage of leverage Residential employs, which could increase substantially in the future, varies depending on assets in its portfolios, its available capital, its ability to obtain and access financing arrangements with lenders and the lenders\u2019 and rating agencies\u2019 estimate of the stability of its investment portfolio\u2019s cash flow. There can be no assurance that new sources of financing will be available to Residential in the future or that existing sources of financing will continue to be available to it. Residential's governing documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt it may incur. Residential's return on investments and cash available for distribution to its stockholders may be reduced to the extent that changes in market conditions increase the cost of its financing relative to the income that can be derived from the investments acquired. Residential's debt service payments will reduce cash flow available for distribution to stockholders. Residential may not be able to meet its debt service obligations and, to the extent that it cannot, it risks the loss of some or all of its assets to foreclosure or sale to satisfy the obligations.\nIf these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n(table of contents)\nIf and when non-recourse long-term financing structures become available to Residential and are utilized, such structures expose it to risks which could result in losses to Residential.\nResidential may use securitization and other non-recourse long-term financing for its investments if, and to the extent, available. In such structures, Residential's lenders typically have only a claim against the assets included in the securitizations rather than a general claim against Residential as an entity. Prior to any such financing, Residential seeks to finance its investments with relatively short-term facilities until a sufficient portfolio is accumulated. Conditions in the capital markets may make the issuance of any such securitization less attractive to Residential. While Residential intends to retain the unrated equity component of securitizations and, therefore, still have exposure to any investments included in such securitizations, its inability to enter into such securitizations may increase its overall exposure to risks associated with direct ownership of such investments, including the risk of default.\nResidential's inability to refinance any short-term facilities would also increase its risk because borrowings thereunder would likely be recourse to it as an entity. If Residential is unable to obtain and renew short-term facilities or to consummate securitizations to finance its investments on a long-term basis, it may be required to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nFailure of Altisource to effectively perform its obligations under various agreements with Residential and us, including the master services agreement, could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nBoth Residential and we have engaged Altisource to provide services. If for any reason Altisource is unable to perform the services described under these agreements at the level and/or the cost that we anticipate, qualified alternate service providers may not be readily available on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely affect our performance under the Residential asset management agreement. Altisource\u2019s failure to perform the services under these agreements with Residential or us or our inability to retain qualified alternate service providers to replace and/or supplement Altisource could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFailure of our third party mortgage servicers, including Ocwen Financial Corporation, to effectively perform their servicing obligations under our servicing agreements could have an adverse effect on Residential.\nResidential is contractually obligated to service the residential mortgage loans that it acquires. Residential does not have any employees, servicing platform, licenses or technical resources necessary to service its acquired loans. Consequently, Residential has engaged mortgage servicers to service the non-performing and sub-performing and non-performing loans it acquires. Through 2014, Residential had exclusively engaged Ocwen Financial Corporation (\u201cOcwen\u201d) to service the residential mortgage loans in its portfolio.\nOcwen has been and is subject to a number of pending regulatory investigations, inquiries, requests for information and legal proceedings that could result in adverse regulatory or other actions against Ocwen. As a result of these various difficulties faced by Ocwen, its debt and servicer ratings have been downgraded. Given the recent challenges and regulatory scrutiny faced by Ocwen, through our connections and experience, Residential has engaged additional alternate servicers to service Residential\u2019s loans. Residential has begun to move certain loans to these new servicers to diversify its servicing service providers. However, a substantial number of the loans Residential owns continue to be serviced by Ocwen. It is possible, even as Residential transfers all or a portion of its mortgage loan portfolio to such other servicers, the alternate servicers may not be able to service our loans or resolve our non-performing loans. If for any reason Residential's mortgage servicers, including Ocwen, are unable to service these loans at the level and/or the cost that Residential anticipates, or if Residential fails to pay or otherwise defaults under the servicing agreements, causing one or more mortgage servicers cease to act as its servicers, alternate servicers may not be readily available on favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on Residential.\nResidential may incur significant costs in renovating its properties, and it may underestimate the costs or amount of time necessary to complete restorations.\nBefore renting a property, we perform a detailed assessment, with an on-site review of the property, to identify the scope of renovation to be completed. Beyond customary repairs, Residential may undertake improvements designed to optimize overall property appeal and increase the value of the property. We expect that nearly all of Residential's rental properties will require some level of renovation immediately upon their acquisition or in the future following expiration of a lease or otherwise. Residential may acquire properties that we plan to extensively renovate and restore. In addition, in order to reposition properties\n(table of contents)\nin the rental market, Residential will be required to make ongoing capital improvements and may need to perform significant renovations and repairs from time to time. Consequently, Residential is exposed to the risks inherent in property renovation, including potential cost overruns, increases in labor and materials costs, delays by contractors in completing work, delays in the timing of receiving necessary work permits and certificates of occupancy and poor workmanship. If our assumptions regarding the cost or timing of renovations across Residential's properties prove to be materially inaccurate, it may be more difficult or take significantly more time than anticipated to develop and grow its single-family rental portfolio, which could materially and adversely affect Residential. This could, in turn, materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nDifficulties in selling REO properties and/or single-family rental properties could limit Residential's flexibility and/or harm its liquidity.\nFederal tax laws may limit Residential's ability to earn a gain on the sale of its properties if it is found to have held or acquired the properties with the intent to resell, and this limitation may adversely affect its willingness to sell single-family rental properties under favorable conditions or if necessary for funding purposes. Residential typically contributes properties that will not meet its rental profile to its taxable REIT subsidiary in order to sell and generate gains or losses at the taxable REIT subsidiary upon such sales. In addition, Residential's REO properties that it intends to sell can at times be difficult to dispose of quickly or at favorable prices. These potential difficulties in selling real estate in Residential's markets may limit its ability to either sell properties that it deems unsuitable for rental or change or reduce the single-family rental properties in its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Residential's failure to sell or delays in selling its REO properties could potentially cause a strain on its liquidity, and it may be forced to reduce prices and/or continue to hold such REO properties without leverage, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nThe growth of Residential's single-family rental portfolio, at least in the short term, is expected to be dependent on its ability to sell portfolios of our non-performing and re-performing mortgage loans at or near the carrying value for those loans or at a profit. If Residential is unable to sell these portfolios of mortgage loans at optimal prices or on a timely basis, or if the market shifts, creating lower sales prices of non-performing mortgage loans, Residential's ability to utilize the equity embedded in these loans would be harmed and have a material adverse effect on its ability to convert the proceeds of such sales into buying power for the acquisition of single-family rental properties. Furthermore, a large portion of the sale proceeds of such non-performing mortgage loans are utilized to purchase the loans off of Residential's repurchase facilities for which the non-performing mortgage loans are collateral. If a higher than expected portion of the loan sale consideration must be utilized to repurchase loans off of its facilities, Residential's ability to purchase single-family rental properties may also be adversely affected, which would slow the growth of its rental portfolio.\nA significant portion of the residential mortgage loans that Residential has acquired, and may continue to acquire, are, or may become, sub-performing or non-performing loans, which increases its risk of loss.\nResidential has acquired, an may continue to acquire, distressed residential mortgage loans where the borrower has failed to make timely payments of principal and/or interest. As part of the residential mortgage loan portfolios Residential purchases, it also may acquire performing loans that subsequently become sub-performing or non-performing. Under current market conditions, it is likely that many of these loans will have current loan-to-value ratios in excess of 100%, meaning the amount owed on the loan exceeds the value of the underlying real estate. Further, the borrowers on such loans may be in economic distress and/or may have become unemployed, bankrupt or otherwise unable or unwilling to make payments when due. Even though Residential typically pays less than the amount owed on these loans to acquire them, if actual results are different from its assumptions in determining the price for such loans, it may incur significant losses. There are no limits on the percentage of sub-performing or non-performing loans Residential may hold. Any loss Residential incurs may be significant and could materially and adversely affect it, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n(table of contents)\nMany of Residential's assets may be illiquid, and this lack of liquidity could significantly impede its ability to vary its portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions or to realize the value at which such assets are carried if it is required to dispose of them.\nThe distressed residential mortgage loans Residential has acquired are generally illiquid in that there are a limited number of qualified or interested parties to acquire the portfolios held for sale. Illiquidity may result from the absence of an established market for the distressed residential mortgage loans, as well as legal or contractual restrictions on their resale, refinancing or other disposition. Such restrictions would interfere with subsequent sales of such loans or adversely affect the terms that could be obtained upon any disposition thereof. Residential recently completed the sale of two portfolios of non-performing loans to unaffiliated third parties and will continue to evaluate the opportunistic sale of additional portfolios of non-performing loans in the future. The timing and extent of its success in selling such assets on acceptable terms or at all cannot be predicted due to their illiquid nature. Residential's inability to sell portfolios of residential mortgage loans on acceptable terms and/or in accordance with its anticipated timing could potentially cause a strain on its liquidity, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\nResidential mortgage loan modification and refinance programs, future legislative action, and other actions and changes may materially and adversely affect the supply of, value of and the returns on single-family rental properties and sub-performing and non-performing loans.\nResidential's business model is partially dependent on the success of its single-family rental property direct purchases and loan modification and other resolution efforts and the conversion of a significant portion of those loans to REO. The number of single-family rental properties as well as sub-performing and non-performing loans available for purchase may be reduced by uncertainty in the lending industry and the governmental sector and/or as a result of general economic volatility, decline or improvement. Sellers of residential rental properties may be unwilling or unable to sell their assets. In addition, for non-performing mortgage loans, lenders may choose to delay foreclosure proceedings, renegotiate interest rates or refinance loans for borrowers who face foreclosure. In recent years, the federal government has instituted a number of programs aimed at assisting at-risk homeowners and reducing the number of properties going into foreclosure or going into non-performing status.\nFor example, the U.S. Government, through the Federal Reserve, the Federal Housing Administration or \u201cFHA\u201d and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or \u201cFDIC\u201d has implemented a number of federal programs designed to assist homeowners, including (i) the Home Affordable Modification Program or \u201cHAMP\u201d, which provides homeowners with assistance in avoiding defaults on residential mortgage loans, (ii) the Hope for Homeowners Program or \u201cH4H Program\u201d, which allows certain distressed borrowers to refinance their residential mortgage loans into FHA-insured loans in order to avoid residential mortgage loan foreclosures and (iii) the Home Affordable Refinance Program, or the \u201cHARP Program,\u201d which allows borrowers who are current on their mortgage payments to refinance and reduce their monthly mortgage payments without new mortgage insurance, up to an unlimited loan-to-value ratio for fixed-rate mortgages. HAMP, the H4H Program, the HARP Program and other loss mitigation programs may involve, among other things, the modification of residential mortgage loans to reduce the principal amount of the loans (through forbearance and/or forgiveness) and/or the rate of interest payable on the loans and/or to extend the payment terms of the loans. These loan modification programs, future legislative or regulatory actions including possible amendments to the bankruptcy laws that result in the modification of outstanding residential mortgage loans as well as changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing residential mortgage loans, may materially and adversely affect the value of, and the returns on, Residential's portfolio of sub-performing and non-performing loans.\nOther governmental actions may affect Residential's business by hindering the pace of foreclosures. In recent periods, there has been a backlog of foreclosures, due to a combination of volume constraints and legal actions, including those brought by the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), State Attorneys General, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d) and the Federal Reserve Board against mortgage servicers alleging wrongful foreclosure practices. Financial institutions have also been subjected to regulatory restrictions and limitations on foreclosure activity by the FDIC. Legal claims brought or threatened by the DOJ, HUD and 49 State Attorneys General against residential mortgage servicers and an enforcement action threatened by the OCC against residential mortgage servicers have both produced large settlements. A portion of the funds from each settlement will be directed to homeowners seeking to avoid foreclosure through mortgage modifications, and servicers are required to adopt specified measures to reduce mortgage obligations in certain situations. It is expected that the settlements will help many homeowners avoid foreclosures that would otherwise have occurred in the near-term. It is also possible that other residential mortgage servicers will agree to similar settlements. These developments will reduce the number of homes in the process of foreclosure and decrease the supply of properties that meet Residential's investment criteria.\n(table of contents)\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress and numerous state legislatures have considered, proposed or adopted legislation to constrain foreclosures, or may do so in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or \u201cCFPB,\u201d which supervises and enforces federal consumer protection laws as they apply to banks, credit unions and other financial companies, including mortgage servicers. It remains uncertain as to whether any of these CFPB or other related\nmeasures will have a significant impact on foreclosure volumes or what the timing or extent of that impact would be. If foreclosure volumes were to decline significantly, Residential may experience difficulty in finding target assets at attractive prices, which would materially and adversely affect Residential. Also, the number of families seeking rental housing might be reduced by such legislation, reducing rental housing demand for properties in Residential's markets.\nResidential may be, or may become, subject to the regulation of various states, including licensing requirements and consumer protection statutes. Residential's failure to comply with any such laws, if applicable to it, would adversely affect its ability to implement its business strategy, which could materially and adversely affect Residential. If these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees would be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain jurisdictions require licenses to purchase, hold, enforce or sell residential mortgage loans. In the event that any such licensing requirement is applicable and Residential is not able to obtain such licenses in a timely manner or at all, its ability to implement its business strategy could be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nCertain jurisdictions require a license to purchase, hold, enforce or sell residential mortgage loans. Residential currently owns its loans in Delaware statutory trusts with a nationally-chartered bank as the trustee. Therefore, it does not hold any such licenses. Because Residential has contributed its acquired sub-performing and non-performing residential mortgage loans to wholly-owned trusts whose trustee is a nationally-chartered bank, it may be exempt from state licensing requirements. However, there is no assurance that Residential will ever seek or be required to obtain such licenses or, if obtained, that it will be able to maintain them. Residential's failure to obtain or maintain such licenses could restrict its ability to invest in loans in these jurisdictions if such licensing requirements become applicable. If Residential's subsidiaries obtain the required licenses, any trust holding loans in the applicable jurisdictions may transfer such loans to such subsidiaries, resulting in these loans being held by a state-licensed entity. There can be no assurance that Residential will be able to obtain the requisite licenses in a timely manner or at all or in all necessary jurisdictions, or that the use of the trusts will reduce the requirement for licensing, any of which could limit its ability to invest in residential mortgage loans in the future and have a material adverse effect on Residential. If these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe availability of portfolios of single-family residential properties for purchase on favorable terms may decline as market conditions change, our industry matures and/or additional purchasers for such portfolios emerge, and the prices for such portfolios may increase, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in supply of single-family residential property portfolios available for sale. Because Residential operates in an emerging industry, market conditions may be volatile, and the prices at which portfolios of single-family residential properties can be acquired may increase from time to time, or permanently, due to new market participants seeking such portfolios, a decrease in the supply of desirable portfolios or other adverse changes in the geographic areas that we may target from time to time. For these reasons, the supply of single-family residential properties that Residential may acquire may decline over time, which could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nPortfolios of properties that Residential has acquired or may acquire may include properties that do not fit its investment criteria, and divestiture of such properties may be costly or time consuming or both, which may adversely affect its operating results.\nResidential acquired, and expects to continue to acquire, portfolios of single-family residential properties, many of which are, or will be, subject to existing leases. To the extent the management and leasing of such properties has not been consistent with its property management and leasing standards, Residential may be subject to a variety of risks, including risks relating to the condition of the properties, the credit quality and employment stability of the tenants and compliance with applicable laws, among others. In addition, financial and other information provided to Residential regarding such portfolios during our due diligence may be inaccurate, and Residential may not be able to obtain relief under contractual remedies, if any. If Residential concludes that certain properties acquired as part of a portfolio do not fit its investment criteria, it may decide to sell such properties and may be required to renovate the properties prior to sale, to hold the properties for an extended marketing period and/or sell the property at an unfavorable price, any of which could materially and adversely affect Residential.\n(table of contents)\nThe supply of sub-performing and non-performing loans may decline over time as a result of higher credit standards for new loans and/or general economic improvement and the prices for sub-performing and non-performing loans may increase, which could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nOver the last several years, there has been an increase in supply of sub-performing and non-performing loans available for sale. However, in response to the economic crisis, the origination of jumbo, subprime, Alt-A and second lien residential mortgage loans has dramatically declined as lenders have increased their standards of credit-worthiness in originating new loans and fewer homeowners may go into sub-performing or non-performing status on their residential mortgage loans. In addition, the prices at which sub-performing and non-performing loans can be acquired may increase from time to time, or permanently, due to the entry of new participants into the distressed loan marketplace or a lower supply of sub-performing and non-performing loans in the marketplace. For these reasons, along with the general improvement in the economy, the supply of sub-performing and non-performing residential mortgage loans that Residential may acquire may decline over time and could materially and adversely affect Residential. If these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCompetition in identifying and acquiring non-performing loans could adversely affect Residential's ability to implement its business strategy, which could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nResidential faces competition from various sources for investment opportunities in sub-performing and non-performing loans including REITs, hedge funds, private equity funds, partnerships and developers. Some third-party competitors have substantially greater financial resources and access to capital than Residential does and may be able to accept more risk than Residential can. Competition from these companies may reduce the number of attractive sub-performing and non-performing loan investment opportunities available to Residential or increase the bargaining power of asset owners seeking to sell, which would increase the prices for sub-performing and non-performing loans. If such events occur, Residential's ability to implement its business strategy could be adversely affected, which could materially and adversely affect Residential. Given the existing competition, complexity of the market and requisite time needed to make such investments, no assurance can be given that Residential will be successful in acquiring investments that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Furthermore, there is no assurance that such investments, once acquired, will perform as expected. If these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nResidential's inability to promptly foreclose upon defaulted residential mortgage loans could increase its costs and/or diminish its expected return on investments.\nResidential's ability seek alternative resolutions for the underlying properties and, in certain cases, where appropriate, to promptly foreclose upon defaulted residential mortgage loans plays a critical role in our valuation of the residential mortgage assets in which it invests and its expected return on those investments. We expect the timeline to convert acquired loans into single-family rental properties will vary significantly by loan. Certain of Residential's acquired loans may already be in foreclosure proceedings, in which case conversion could be as soon as three to six months following acquisition, but in other cases conversion could take up to 24 months or longer. There are a variety of factors that may inhibit Residential's ability, through its mortgage servicers, to foreclose upon a residential mortgage loan and get access to the real property within the timelines modeled as part of our valuation process. These factors include, without limitation: state foreclosure timelines and deferrals associated therewith (including with respect to litigation, bankruptcy and statute of limitations); unauthorized occupants living in the property; federal, state or local legislative action or initiatives designed to provide homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures and that serve to delay the foreclosure process; HAMP and similar programs that require specific procedures to be followed to explore the refinancing of a residential mortgage loan prior to the commencement of a foreclosure proceeding; and continued declines in real estate values and sustained high levels of unemployment that increase the number of foreclosures and place additional pressure on the already overburdened judicial and administrative systems.\nIn addition, certain issues, including \u201crobo-signing,\u201d have been identified throughout the mortgage industry that relate to affidavits used in connection with the residential mortgage loan foreclosure process. A substantial portion of Residential's investments are, and in the future may be, sub-performing and non-performing residential mortgage loans, many of which are already subject to foreclosure proceedings at the time of purchase. There can be no assurance that similar practices have not been followed in connection with residential mortgage loans that are already subject to foreclosure proceedings at the time of purchase. To the extent we determine that any of the loans Residential acquires are impacted by these issues, Residential may be required to recommence the foreclosure proceedings relating to such loans, thereby resulting in additional delay that could\n(table of contents)\nhave the effect of increasing its costs and/or diminishing its expected return on its investments. The uncertainty surrounding these issues could also result in legal, regulatory or industry changes to the foreclosure process as a whole, any or all of which could lengthen the foreclosure process and negatively impact Residential's business.\nIf these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nResidential may be materially and adversely affected by risks affecting borrowers or the single-family rental properties in which its investments may be concentrated at any given time, as well as from unfavorable changes in the related geographic regions.\nResidential's assets are not subject to any geographic diversification requirements or concentration limitations. Entities that sell distressed mortgage loan or residential rental portfolios may group the portfolios by location or other metrics that could result in a concentration of Residential's portfolio by geography, single-family rental property characteristics and/or borrower demographics. Such concentration could increase the risk of loss to Residential if the particular concentration in its portfolio is subject to greater risks or undergoing adverse developments. In addition, adverse conditions in the areas where the properties or borrowers are located (including business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, oversupply, reduced demand and other factors) may have an adverse effect on the value of its investments. A material decline in the demand for single-family housing or rentals in these or other areas where Residential owns assets may materially and adversely affect Residential. Lack of diversification can increase the correlation of non-performance and foreclosure risks among Residential's investments. If these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nShort-term leases of residential property expose Residential more quickly to the effects of declining market rents.\nWe anticipate that a majority of Residential's leases to tenants of single-family rental properties will be for a term of one to two years. As these leases permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, we anticipate Residential's rental revenues will be affected by declines in market rents more quickly than if its leases were for longer terms. Short-term leases may result in high turnover, resulting in additional cost to renovate and maintain the property and lower occupancy levels. Because Residential has a limited operating history, its tenant turnover rate and related cost estimates may be less accurate than if we had more operating data upon which to base these estimates.\nResidential may be unable to secure funds for future tenant or other capital improvements, which could limit its ability to attract or replace tenants.\nWhen Residential acquires or otherwise takes title to single-family properties or when tenants fail to renew their leases or otherwise vacate their space, Residential generally will be required to expend funds for property restoration and leasing commissions in order to lease the property. If Residential has not established reserves or set aside sufficient funds for such expenditures, it may have to obtain financing from other sources, as to which no assurance can be given. Residential may also have future financing needs for other capital improvements to restore its properties. If Residential needs to secure financing for capital improvements in the future but are unable to secure such financing on favorable terms or at all, Residential may be unable or unwilling to make capital improvements or it may be required or may choose to defer such improvements. If this happens, Residential's properties may suffer from a greater risk of obsolescence or a decline in value, or a greater risk of decreased cash flow as a result of fewer potential tenants being attracted to the property or existing tenants not renewing their leases. If Residential does not have access to sufficient funding in the future, it may not be able to make necessary capital improvements to its properties, and its properties\u2019 ability to generate revenue may be significantly impaired. If these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nResidential's revenue and expenses are not directly correlated, and, because a large percentage of its costs and expenses are fixed and some variable expenses may not decrease over time, it may not be able to adapt its cost structure to offset any declines in its revenue.\nMany of the expenses associated with Residential's business, such as acquisition costs, restoration and maintenance costs, HOA fees, personal and real property taxes, insurance, compensation and other general expenses are fixed and would not necessarily decrease proportionally with any decrease in revenue. Residential's assets also will likely require a significant amount of ongoing capital expenditure. Residential's expenses, including capital expenditures, will be affected by, among other things, any inflationary increases, and cost increases may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. Certain expenses, such as HOA\n(table of contents)\nfees, taxes, insurance and maintenance costs are recurring in nature and may not decrease on a per-unit basis as Residential's portfolio grows through additional property acquisitions. By contrast, Residential's revenue is affected by many factors beyond our control, such as the availability and price of alternative rental housing and economic conditions in its markets. As a result, Residential may not be able to fully, or even partially, offset any increase in its expenses with a corresponding increase in its revenues. In addition, state and local regulations may require Residential to maintain its properties, even if the cost of maintenance is greater than the potential benefit. If these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nFair values of Residential's mortgage loans are imprecise and may materially and adversely affect its operating results and credit availability, which, in turn, would materially and adversely affect Residential.\nThe values of Residential's mortgage loans may not be readily determinable. We measure the fair value of Residential's mortgage loans monthly, but the fair value at which Residential's mortgage loans are recorded may not be an indication of their realizable value. Ultimate realization of the value of a mortgage loan depends to a great extent on economic and other conditions that are beyond our control. Further, fair value is only an estimate based on good faith judgment of the price at which a mortgage loan can be sold since market prices of mortgage loans can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. In certain cases, our estimation of the fair value of Residential's mortgage loans includes inputs provided by third-party dealers and pricing services, and valuations of certain securities or other assets in which we invest are often difficult to obtain and are subject to judgments that may vary among market participants. Changes in the estimated fair values of Residential's mortgage loans are directly charged or credited to earnings for the period. If Residential were to liquidate a particular mortgage loan, the realized value may be more than or less than the amount at which such mortgage loan was recorded. We could be materially and adversely affected by negative determinations that reduce the fair value of Residential's mortgage loans, and such valuations may fluctuate over short periods of time.\nWe value the properties underlying Residential's mortgage loans and recognize unrealized gains in each period when Residential's mortgage loans are transferred to real estate owned. The fair value of residential properties is estimated using broker price opinions, or \u201cBPOs,\u201d provided by third-party brokers. BPOs are subject to the judgments of the particular broker formed by visiting the property, assessing general home values in the area, reviewing comparable listings and reviewing comparable completed sales. These judgments may vary among brokers and may fluctuate over time based on housing market activities and the influx of additional comparable listings and sales. Residential's results could be materially and adversely affected if the judgments used by the brokers prove to be incorrect or inaccurate.\nIf these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nChallenges to the MERS\u00ae System could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nMERSCORP, Inc. is a privately held company that maintains an electronic registry, referred to as the MERS System, which tracks servicing rights and ownership of loans in the United States. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., or \u201cMERS,\u201d a wholly owned subsidiary of MERSCORP, Inc., can serve as a nominee for the owner of a residential mortgage loan and in that role initiate foreclosures and/or become the mortgagee of record for the loan in local land records. We may choose to use MERS as a nominee. The MERS System is widely used by participants in the mortgage finance industry. Several legal challenges have been made disputing MERS\u2019s legal standing to initiate foreclosures and/or act as nominee in local land records. These challenges could negatively affect MERS\u2019s ability to serve as the mortgagee of record in some jurisdictions. In addition, where MERS is the mortgagee of record, it must execute assignments of mortgages, affidavits and other legal documents in connection with foreclosure proceedings. As a result, investigations by governmental authorities and others into the servicer foreclosure process deficiencies described with respect to \u201cResidential's inability to promptly foreclose upon defaulted residential mortgage loans could increase its cost of doing business and/or diminish its expected return on investments\u201d may impact MERS. Failures by MERS to apply prudent and effective process controls and to comply with legal and other requirements in the foreclosure process could pose operational, reputational and legal risks that may materially and adversely affect Residential, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n(table of contents)\nWe utilize analytical models and data in connection with the valuation of Residential's investments, and any incorrect, misleading or incomplete information used in connection therewith would subject Residential to potential risks.\nGiven the complexity of Residential's investments and strategies, we must rely heavily on models and data, including analytical models (both proprietary models developed by us and those supplied by third parties) and information and data supplied by third parties. Models and data are used to value investments or potential investments and also in connection with performing due diligence on Residential's investments. In the event models and data prove to be incorrect, misleading or incomplete, any decisions made in reliance thereon expose us to potential risks. For example, by relying on incorrect models and data, especially valuation models, Residential may be induced to buy certain investments at prices that are too high, to sell certain other investments at prices that are too low or to miss favorable opportunities altogether, all of which could adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements Residential is subject to as a stand-alone reporting public company.\nResidential is subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act, as amended. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act,\u201d Residential is required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. To comply with these requirements, Residential may need to implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. Residential has incurred, and expects to incur, additional annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these requirements, and these expenses may be significant. If Residential is unable to implement additional controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, its ability to comply with its financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on Residential. Residential is also required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and a report thereon by its independent registered public accounting firm. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on its management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources.\nChanges in global economic and capital market conditions, including periods of generally deteriorating occupancy and real estate industry fundamentals may materially and adversely affect Residential.\nThere are risks to the ownership of real estate and real estate related assets, including decreases in residential property values, changes in global, national, regional or local economic, demographic and real estate market conditions as well as other factors particular to the locations of Residential's investments. A prolonged recession and a slow recovery could materially and adversely affect Residential as a result of, among other items, the following:\n\u2022\njoblessness or unemployment rates that adversely affect the local economy;\n\u2022\nan oversupply of or a reduced demand for single-family rental properties for rent;\n\u2022\na decline in employment or lack of employment growth;\n\u2022\nthe inability or unwillingness of residents to pay rent increases or fulfill their lease obligations;\n\u2022\na decline in rental rate which may be accentuated since we expect Residential to have rent terms of one to two years;\n\u2022\nrent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing that could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates, availability and terms of debt financing; and\n\u2022\neconomic conditions that could cause an increase in Residential's operating expenses such as increases in property taxes, utilities and routine maintenance.\nThese conditions could also adversely impact the financial condition and liquidity of the renters that will occupy Residential's real estate properties and, as a result, their ability to pay rent to Residential.\nInflation or deflation may adversely affect Residential's results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased inflation could have an adverse impact on interest rates, property management expenses and general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than Residential's rental and other revenue. Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents and other sources of income without an accompanying reduction in Residential's expenses. Accordingly, inflation or deflation may adversely affect Residential's results of operations and cash flows, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\n(table of contents)\nChanges in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable law could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nAs an owner of real estate, Residential is required to comply with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations. These laws and regulations may include zoning laws, building codes, landlord-tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations. Noncompliance with laws or regulations could expose Residential to liability.\nLower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from Residential's need to comply with changes in (i) laws imposing remediation requirements and potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlord-tenant laws or (iii) other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the rehabilitation, use and operation of Residential's single-family rental properties including changes to building codes and fire and life-safety codes. If these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, NewSource has registered as a Class 3A Bermuda insurance company and is subject to regulation and supervision in Bermuda by the BMA. Changes in Bermuda insurance statutes, regulations and policies could result in restrictions on NewSource\u2019s ability to pursue its business plans, issue reinsurance policies, distribute funds and execute its investment strategy. In addition, NewSource may become subject to regulation and supervision by insurance authorities in any other jurisdictions in which it operates. Failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate authorizations and/or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on NewSource\u2019s ability to do business or certain activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which it operates and could subject NewSource to fines and other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on NewSource\u2019s business. As a result, the value of our investment in NewSource could decline.\nCompetition could limit Residential's ability to lease single-family rental properties or increase or maintain rents.\nResidential's single-family rental properties, when acquired, will compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents, including rental apartments, condominiums and other single-family homes available for rent as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. Residential's competitors\u2019 single-family rental properties may be better quality, in a more desirable location or have leasing terms more favorable than Residential can provide. In addition, Residential's ability to compete and generate favorable returns depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, the financial condition and liquidity of current and prospective renters, availability and cost of capital, taxes and governmental regulations. Given Residential's significant competition, we cannot assure you that it will be successful in acquiring or managing single-family rental properties that generate favorable returns, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nIf rents in Residential's markets do not increase sufficiently to keep pace with rising costs of operations, its operating results and cash available for distribution will decline.\nThe success of Residential's business model will substantially depend on conditions in the single-family rental property market in its geographic markets. Residential's asset acquisitions are premised on assumptions about, among other things, occupancy and rent levels. If those assumptions prove to be inaccurate, Residential's operating results and cash available for distribution will be lower than expected, potentially materially. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees. Rental rates and occupancy levels have benefited in recent periods from macroeconomic trends affecting the U.S. economy and residential real estate and mortgage markets in particular, including:\n\u2022\na tightening of credit that has made it more difficult to finance a home purchase, combined with efforts by consumers generally to reduce their exposure to credit;\n\u2022\neconomic and employment conditions that have increased foreclosure rates; and\n\u2022\nreduced real estate values that challenged the traditional notion that homeownership is a stable investment.\nIf the current trend favoring renting rather than homeownership reverses, the single-family rental market could decline.\nThe single-family rental market is currently significantly larger than in historical periods. We do not expect the favorable trends in the single-family rental market to continue indefinitely. Eventually, a strengthening of the U.S. economy and job growth, together with the large supply of foreclosed single-family rental properties, the current availability of low residential mortgage rates and government sponsored programs promoting home ownership, may contribute to a stabilization or reversal of the current trend that favors renting rather than homeownership. In addition, we expect that as investors increasingly seek to\n(table of contents)\ncapitalize on opportunities to purchase undervalued housing properties and convert them to productive uses, the supply of single-family rental properties will decrease and the competition for tenants will intensify. A softening of the rental property market in Residential's markets would adversely affect its operating results and cash available for distribution, potentially materially. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nSingle-family rental properties that are subject to foreclosure or short-sales are subject to risks of theft, vandalism or other damage that could impair their value.\nWhen a single-family rental property is subject to foreclosure, it is possible that the homeowner may cease to maintain the property adequately, or that the property may be abandoned by the homeowner and become susceptible to theft or vandalism. Lack of maintenance, theft and vandalism can substantially impair the value of the property. To the extent Residential initiates foreclosure proceedings, some of its properties could be impaired.\nContingent or unknown liabilities could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nResidential's acquisition activities are subject to many risks. Residential may acquire properties that are subject to unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for or with respect to liens attached to properties, unpaid real estate taxes, utilities or HOA charges for which a prior owner remains liable, clean-up or remediation of environmental conditions or code violations, claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the acquired properties and tax liabilities, among other things. In each case, Residential's acquisition may be without any, or with only limited, recourse with respect to unknown or contingent liabilities or conditions. As a result, if any such liability were to arise relating to Residential's properties, or if any adverse condition exists with respect to Residential's properties that is in excess of its insurance coverage, Residential might have to pay substantial sums to settle or cure it, which could materially and adversely affect Residential. The properties Residential acquires may also be subject to covenants, conditions or restrictions that restrict the use or ownership of such properties, including prohibitions on leasing or requirements to obtain the approval of HOAs prior to leasing. We may not discover such restrictions during the acquisition process and such restrictions may adversely affect Residential's ability to operate such properties as it intends. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nThe costs and amount of time necessary to secure possession and control of a newly acquired property may exceed our assumptions, which would delay Residential's receipt of revenue from, and return on, the property.\nUpon acquiring a property, Residential may have to evict occupants who are in unlawful possession before it can secure possession and control of the property. The holdover occupants may be the former owners or tenants of a property, or they may be squatters or others who are illegally in possession. Securing control and possession from these occupants can be both costly and time-consuming. If these costs and delays exceed our expectations, Residential's and our financial performance may suffer because of the increased expenses incurred or the unexpected delays in turning the properties into revenue-producing rental properties.\nPoor tenant selection and defaults by Residential's tenants may materially and adversely affect Residential.\nResidential's success will depend, in large part, upon its ability to attract and retain qualified tenants for its properties. This will depend, in turn, upon Residential's ability to screen applicants, identify good tenants and avoid tenants who may default. Residential will inevitably make mistakes in its selection of tenants, and it may rent to tenants whose default on its leases or failure to comply with the terms of the lease or HOA regulations could materially and adversely affect Residential. For example, tenants may default on payment of rent, make unreasonable and repeated demands for service or improvements, make unsupported or unjustified complaints to regulatory or political authorities, make use of Residential's properties for illegal purposes, damage or make unauthorized structural changes to its properties which may not be fully covered by security deposits, refuse to leave the property when the lease is terminated, engage in domestic violence or similar disturbances, disturb nearby residents with noise, trash, odors or eyesores, fail to comply with HOA regulations, sub-let to less desirable individuals in violation of Residential's leases or permit unauthorized persons to live with them. The process of evicting a defaulting tenant from a family residence can be adversarial, protracted and costly. Furthermore, some tenants facing eviction may damage or destroy the property. Damage to Residential's properties may significantly delay re-leasing after eviction, necessitate expensive repairs or impair the rental revenue or value of the property. In addition, Residential will incur turnover costs associated with re-leasing the properties, such as marketing expense and brokerage commissions, and will not collect revenue while the property is vacant. Although Residential will attempt to work with tenants to prevent such damage or destruction, there can be no assurance that it will be successful in all or most cases. Such tenants will not only cause Residential not to achieve its financial objectives for the properties in which they live, but may subject Residential to liability, and may damage Residential's reputation with its other tenants and in the communities where it does business. If these risks are realized by Residential, our\n(table of contents)\nability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nEminent domain could lead to material losses on Residential's investments.\nIt is possible that governmental authorities may exercise eminent domain to acquire land on which Residential's properties are built in order to build roads or other infrastructure. Any such exercise of eminent domain would allow Residential to recover only the fair value of the affected properties, which we believe may be interpreted to be substantially less than the actual value of the property. Several cities are also exploring proposals to use eminent domain to acquire residential loans to assist borrowers to remain in their homes, potentially reducing the supply of single-family properties for sale in Residential's markets. Any of these events can cause a material loss to Residential, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nA significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on Residential.\nResidential will carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to its single-family rental properties on terms we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of losses (such as losses arising from acts of war or earthquake) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it economically impractical. If an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur, Residential could lose its capital invested in a single-family rental property or group of rental properties as well as the anticipated future revenues from such single-family rental property or group of properties. If an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur, Residential would incur the cost of defense and settlement with or court ordered damages to that third party. A significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect Residential, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nA significant number of Residential's single-family rental properties may be part of homeowners\u2019 associations. Residential and its renters will be subject to the rules and regulations of such homeowners\u2019 associations which may be arbitrary or restrictive and violations of such rules may subject us to additional fees and penalties and litigation which may be costly.\nA significant number of Residential's single-family rental properties, when acquired, may be subject to HOAs which are private entities that regulate the activities of and levy assessments on properties in a residential subdivision. Some of the HOAs that will govern Residential's single-family rental properties may enact onerous or arbitrary rules that restrict Residential's ability to renovate, market or lease its single-family rental properties or require it to renovate or maintain such properties at standards or costs that are in excess of our planned operating budgets. Such rules may include requirements for landscaping, limitations on signage promoting a property for lease or sale or the use of specific construction materials to be used in renovations. Some HOAs also impose limits on the number of property owners who may rent their homes which, if met or exceeded, may cause Residential to incur additional costs to sell the affected single-family rental property and opportunity costs of lost rental income. Furthermore, many HOAs impose restrictions on the conduct of occupants of homes and the use of common areas, and Residential may have renters who violate these HOA rules for which Residential may be liable as the property owner. Additionally, the boards of directors of the HOAs that will govern its single-family rental properties may not make important disclosures or may block Residential's access to HOA records, initiate litigation, restrict its ability to sell, impose assessments or arbitrarily change the HOA rules. Residential may be unaware of or unable to review or comply with certain HOA rules before acquiring a single-family rental property, and any such excessively restrictive or arbitrary regulations may cause Residential to sell such property, if possible, prevent it from renting such property or otherwise reduce its cash flow from such property. Any of the above-described occurrences may materially and adversely affect Residential\u2019s and our results of operations and financial condition.\n(table of contents)\nWe rely on information supplied by prospective tenants in managing Residential's business.\nWe rely on information supplied to us by prospective tenants in their rental applications as part of our due diligence process to make leasing decisions, and we cannot be certain that this information is accurate. In particular, we rely on information submitted by prospective tenants regarding household income, tenure at current job, number of children and size of household. Moreover, these applications are submitted to us at the time we evaluate a prospective tenant, and we do not require tenants to provide us with updated information during the terms of their leases, notwithstanding the fact that this information can, and frequently does, change over time. Even though this information is not updated, we will use it to evaluate the overall average credit characteristics of Residential's portfolio over time. If tenant-supplied information is inaccurate or Residential's tenants\u2019 creditworthiness declines over time, we may make poor leasing decisions and Residential's portfolio may contain more credit risk than we believe exists, which could harm Residential\u2019s and our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the risks of securities laws liability and related civil litigation.\nWe may be subject to risk of securities litigation and derivative actions from time to time as a result of being publicly traded. For example, in January 2015, a purported shareholder filed a derivative action against the members of Residential's Board of Directors, Residential and us in connection with Residential's asset management agreement with us, which Residential ultimately agreed to settle for $6.0 million. This settlement was covered by and paid for with Directors & Officers Insurance, but other ongoing and/or future claims may not be covered or partially covered, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in one or more periods. Other derivative actions and class actions were also filed against us and/or Residential during 2015, either as the primary defendant or as an aiding and abetting defendant. There can be no assurance that any settlement or liabilities in these actions would be covered by Residential's or our insurance policies. For more information concerning these matters, please see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d While we and Residential and our respective Boards of Directors deny the allegations of wrongdoing in the actions initiated against us, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome or timing of their resolution. The range of possible resolutions could include determinations and judgments against Residential or us or settlements that could require substantial payments by Residential or us, including the costs of defending such investigations and suits, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. An adverse resolution of any future lawsuits or claims against Residential or us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nResidential likely will incur costs due to litigation, including but not limited to, class actions, tenant rights claims and consumer demands.\nThere are numerous tenants\u2019 rights and consumer rights organizations throughout the country. As Residential grows in scale, it may attract attention from some of these organizations and become a target of legal demands or litigation. Many such consumer organizations have become more active and better funded in connection with mortgage foreclosure-related issues and displaced home ownership. Some of these organizations may shift their litigation, lobbying, fundraising and grass roots organizing activities to focus on landlord-tenant issues as more entities engage in the single-family rental property market. Additional actions that may be targeted at Residential include eviction proceedings and other landlord-tenant disputes, challenges to title and ownership rights (including actions brought by prior owners alleging wrongful foreclosure by their lender or servicer) and issues with local housing officials arising from the condition or maintenance of a single-family rental property. While we intend to conduct Residential's rental business lawfully and in compliance with applicable landlord-tenant and consumer laws, such organizations might work in conjunction with trial and pro bono lawyers in one state or multiple states to attempt to bring claims against Residential on a class action basis for damages or injunctive relief. We cannot anticipate what form such legal actions might take or what remedies they may seek. Any of such claims may result in a finding of liability that may materially and adversely affect Residential.\nAdditionally, these organizations may lobby local county and municipal attorneys or state attorneys general to pursue enforcement or litigation against Residential or may lobby state and local legislatures to pass new laws and regulations to constrain Residential's business operations. If they are successful in any such endeavors, they could directly limit and constrain Residential's business operations and impose on Residential significant litigation expenses, including settlements to avoid continued litigation or judgments for damages or injunctions. Any of the above-described occurrences may materially and adversely affect Residential, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise Residential's and/or our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of Residential's and our business, we, through Altisource or Residential's mortgage servicers, may acquire and store sensitive data on our network, such as our proprietary business information and personally identifiable\n(table of contents)\ninformation of Residential's prospective and current tenants. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be subject to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption to our operations and the services we provide to customers or damage our reputation, which could materially and adversely affect Residential and/or us.\nResidential may incur substantial costs due to environmental contamination or non-compliance.\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental and public health laws, regulations and ordinances, Residential may be required, regardless of knowledge or responsibility, to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at its single-family rental properties (including in some cases, asbestos-containing construction materials, lead-based paints, contaminants migrating from offsite sources and natural substances such as methane, mold and radon gas) and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property, personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination. These damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage Residential may have for such events, either of which could materially and adversely affect Residential. The presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect Residential's ability to borrow against, sell or rent the affected single-family rental property. In addition, some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination, which may also adversely affect Residential's ability to borrow against, sell or rent the affected single-family rental property. If these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nResidential properties will be subject to property and other taxes that may increase over time.\nResidential will be responsible for property taxes for its single-family rental properties, when acquired which may increase as tax rates change and properties are reassessed by taxing authorities. If Residential fails to pay any such taxes, the applicable taxing authorities may place a lien on the property and the property may be subject to a tax sale. Increases in property taxes would also adversely affect Residential's yield from rental properties. Any such occurrence may materially and adversely affect Residential which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect us.\nIf Residential is deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, it would have significant adverse consequences to Residential and us.\nResidential does not intend or expect to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the \u201cInvestment Company Act,\u201d since it will not engage primarily or hold itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, Residential will be primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring real estate and mortgages on real estate, specifically single family rental assets and sub-performing and non-performing loans. To the extent that the SEC determines that Residential is in fact an investment company, Residential intends to rely on the exception from the Investment Company Act set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which excludes from the definition of investment company ''any person who is not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, and who is primarily engaged in one or more of the following businesses: . . .(C) purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.'' The SEC has historically taken the position that an issuer may rely on the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) as long as at least 55% of its assets consist of ''qualifying interests,'' such as mortgage loans which are secured by real estate and other liens on and interests in real estate, and an additional 25% consists of real estate-type interests. The SEC has also historically indicated that up to 20% of an issuer's total assets may be invested in miscellaneous investments. Residential believes that all of its assets will fall within the definition of ''qualifying assets.'' Additionally, Residential does not currently expect to issue redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, as those terms are defined by the Investment Company Act. Consequently, Residential believes that it will not be required to register under the Investment Company Act.\nIn August 2011, the SEC issued a concept release that indicated that the SEC is reviewing whether certain mortgage related pools which rely (like Residential) on the exception from registration under Section 3(c)(5)(C), should continue to be allowed to rely on such exception from registration. Since Residential's primary investment strategy is to directly invest in REO Properties and mortgages secured by real estate, Residential does not believe that the SEC's review will have a material impact\n(table of contents)\non its status as a non-investment company business or its ability to continue to rely on the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exception; however, Residential cannot provide any assurance that the outcome of the SEC's review will not require Residential to register under the Investment Company Act. If Residential is determined to be an investment company or it fails to qualify for this exception from registration as an investment company, or the SEC determines that companies that engage in businesses similar to Residential's are no longer able to rely on this exception, Residential may be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nRegistration under the Investment Company Act would require Residential to comply with a variety of substantive requirements that impose, among other things:\n\u2022\nlimitations on capital structure;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on specified investments;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on retaining earnings;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on leverage or senior securities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on unsecured borrowings;\n\u2022\nrequirements that Residential's income be derived from certain types of assets;\n\u2022\nprohibitions on transactions with affiliates and\n\u2022\ncompliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly increase Residential's operating expenses.\nIf Residential were required to register as an investment company but failed to do so, it would be prohibited from engaging in its business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against it.\nRegistration with the SEC as an investment company would be costly, would subject Residential to a host of complex regulations and would divert attention from the conduct of Residential's business. In addition, if Residential purchases or sells any real estate assets to avoid becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act, it could materially adversely affect its net asset value, the amount of funds available for investment and its ability to pay distributions to its shareholders. Any such occurrences would adversely impact our income from the incentive management fees paid by Residential.\nRisks Related to Our Management and Our Relationships\nWe could have conflicts with Residential, and our former Chairman, other members of our Board of Directors or management could have conflicts of interest due to his, her or their relationship with Altisource, Ocwen or Residential, which may be resolved in a manner adverse to us.\nWe have engaged, and continue to engage, in a substantial amount of business with Residential. Conflicts may arise between Residential and us because of our ongoing agreement with Residential and because of the nature of our respective businesses.\nPrior to his stepping down from the Board of Directors in January 2015, our former Chairman was also the Chairman of Altisource, Ocwen and Residential. As a result, he had obligations to us as well as to these other entities, which potentially could have resulted in conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and Altisource, Ocwen or Residential, as the case may be. Our former Chairman also has substantial investments in Altisource, Ocwen and Residential, and certain of our other officers own stock or options in Altisource, Ocwen and/or Residential. Such ownership interests may have created, or appeared to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and Altisource, Ocwen and Residential, as the case may be.\nEach of our executive officers is also an executive officer of Residential and has interests in our relationship with Residential that may be different than the interests of our stockholders. As a result, they may have obligations to us and Residential, and could have conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and Residential. In particular, these individuals have a direct interest in the financial success of Residential that may encourage these individuals to support strategies in furtherance of the financial success of Residential that could potentially adversely impact us\nWe follow policies, procedures and practices to avoid potential conflicts with respect to our dealings with Residential or AAMC, including where necessary, certain of our officers recusing themselves from discussions on, and approvals of transactions with Residential. We also manage potential conflicts of interest through oversight by independent members of our Board of Directors (independent directors constitute a majority of our Board of Directors), and we will also seek to manage these potential conflicts through dispute resolution and other provisions of our agreements with Residential. Although we\n(table of contents)\ncontinue to seek ways to lessen many of these potential conflicts of interest, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective, that we will be able to resolve all conflicts with Residential, or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were dealing with a third party that had none of the connections we have with Residential.\nOur Directors have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as ours.\nOur Directors may have other investments and business activities in addition to their interest in, and responsibilities to, us. Under the provisions of our Charter and our bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d), our Directors have no duty to abstain from exercising the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as ours or employ or otherwise engage any of the other Directors. If any of our Directors who are also directors, officers or employees of any company acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity outside of his capacity as one of our Directors, then our Bylaws provide that such Director will be permitted to pursue that corporate opportunity independently of us, so long as the Director has acted in good faith. Our Bylaws provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such a Director will be deemed to have satisfied his fiduciary duties to us and will not be liable to us for pursuing such a corporate opportunity independently of us. This may create conflicts of interest between us and certain of our Directors and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our stockholders. As of this date, none of our Directors is directly involved as a director, officer or employee of a business that competes with us, but there can be no assurance that will remain unchanged in the future.\nRisks Related to Residential's Qualification as a REIT\nResidential\u2019s failure to qualify as a REIT would materially and adversely affect Residential and us.\nResidential made an election to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 2013. However, we cannot assure you that Residential will remain qualified as a REIT. Moreover, Residential's qualification and taxation as a REIT will depend upon its ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual operating results, certain qualification tests set forth in the federal income tax laws. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that Residential's actual results of operations for any particular taxable year will satisfy such requirements. If Residential fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to its stockholders because:\n\u2022\nResidential would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income;\n\u2022\nResidential could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax to a greater extent and possibly increased state and local taxes; and\n\u2022\nunless Residential is entitled to relief under certain federal income tax laws, it could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which it failed to qualify as a REIT. In addition, if Residential fails to qualify as a REIT, it will no longer be required to make distributions.\nAs a result of all these factors, Residential's failure to qualify as a REIT could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital, and it could materially and adversely affect Residential and the market price of its common stock. If these risks are realized by Residential, our ability to generate incentive management fees could be harmed and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nResidential's tax position with respect to the accrual of interest and market discount income with respect to distressed mortgage loans involves risk.\nResidential does not accrue interest income or market discount on defaulted or delinquent loans when certain criteria are satisfied. The criteria generally relate to whether those amounts are uncollectible or of doubtful collectability. If the Internal Revenue Service were to challenge this position successfully, Residential could be subject to entity level excise tax as a result of \u201cdeficiency dividends\u201d that it may be required to pay to its stockholders at the time of such an adjustment to its income in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\n(table of contents)\nCompliance with REIT requirements may cause Residential to forego otherwise attractive opportunities which may hinder or delay its ability to meet its investment objectives and reduce your overall return.\nTo qualify as a REIT, Residential is required at all times to satisfy certain tests relating to, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of its assets, its financing, hedging and investment strategies, the ownership of its stock and amounts it distributes to its stockholders. Compliance with the REIT requirements may preclude Residential from certain financing or hedging strategies or cause it to forego otherwise attractive opportunities which may hinder or delay its ability to meet its investment objectives and reduce your overall return. For example, Residential may be required to pay distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when it does not have funds readily available for distribution.\nCompliance with REIT requirements may force Residential to liquidate otherwise attractive investments, which could materially adversely affect Residential.\nTo qualify as a REIT, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of Residential's assets must consist of qualified real estate assets, cash, cash items and government securities. In addition, no more than 25% of the value of Residential's assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Except for securities that qualify for purposes of the 75% asset test above and investments in Residential's qualified REIT subsidiaries and its taxable REIT subsidiaries, its investment in the value of any one issuer\u2019s securities may not exceed 5% of the value of its total assets, and it may not own more than 10% of the total vote or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer, except, in the case of the 10% value test, certain \u201cstraight debt\u201d securities. In order to satisfy these requirements, Residential may be forced to liquidate otherwise attractive investments, potentially at a loss, which could materially and adversely affect Residential. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nFailure to make required distributions would subject Residential to federal corporate income tax.\nWe intend to continue to operate Residential in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In order to qualify as a REIT, Residential generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, each year to its stockholders. To the extent that Residential satisfies this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of its REIT taxable income, it will be subject to federal corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, Residential will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that it pays out to its stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code.\nThe IRS may deem the gains from sales of Residential's properties to be subject to a 100% prohibited transaction tax.\nFrom time to time, Residential may be forced to sell properties that do not meet its investment objectives or it may need to sell properties, mortgage loans or other assets either because they do not meet its rental portfolio objectives or to satisfy its REIT distribution requirements. In general, REITs do not sell residential assets out of the REIT so they are not determined to be a \u201cdealer.\u201d If Residential were to purchase real estate assets with a view toward re-selling them, it could be considered a \u201cdealer\u201d of real estate, which could cause Residential to fail to meet its REIT requirements or such sales could be considered \u201cprohibited transactions.\u201d Because Residential has historically purchased large portfolios of mortgage loans with a view toward converting them into rental homes, there are always going to be assets that it purchases as part of all-or none portfolios that are not acceptable for its portfolio and necessary to sell. Typically, Residential contributes REO properties that it determines will not meet its rental portfolio criteria to its taxable REIT subsidiary to prevent the sales from being deemed prohibited transactions. In addition, Residential has been selling its non-performing loan portfolios from its qualified REIT subsidiaries, but Residential expects to limit such portfolios to fewer than six in any calendar year based on guidance that fewer than six sales per year would not result in these transactions being \u201cprohibited transactions.\u201d The IRS may deem one or more sales of Residential's properties to be \u201cprohibited transactions.\u201d If the IRS takes the position that Residential has engaged in a \u201cprohibited transaction\u201d (i.e., if Residential sells a property held by us primarily for sale in the ordinary course of our trade or business), the gain it recognizes from such sale would not disqualify Residential as a REIT, but such gains would be subject to a 100% tax. The Code sets forth a safe harbor for REITs that wish to sell property without risking the imposition of the 100% tax; however, there is no assurance that Residential will be able to qualify for the safe harbor. Residential does not intend to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business; however, there is no assurance that its position will not be challenged by the IRS especially if it makes frequent sales or sales of property in which it has short holding periods. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\n(table of contents)\nThe \u201ctaxable mortgage pool\u201d rules may increase the taxes that Residential or Residential\u2019s stockholders may incur, and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations.\nSecuritizations by us or our subsidiaries could result in the creation of taxable mortgage pools for U.S. federal income tax purposes, resulting in \u201cexcess inclusion income.\u201d As a REIT, so long as we own 100% of the equity interests in a taxable mortgage pool, we generally would not be adversely affected by the characterization of the securitization as a taxable mortgage pool. Certain categories of stockholders, however, such as non-U.S. stockholders eligible for treaty or other benefits, stockholders with net operating losses, and certain tax-exempt U.S. stockholders that are subject to unrelated business income tax, could be subject to increased taxes on a portion of their dividend income from us that is attributable to the excess inclusion income. In the case of a stockholder that is a REIT, a regulated investment company, or RIC, common trust fund or other pass-through entity, our allocable share of our excess inclusion income could be considered excess inclusion income of such entity. In addition, to the extent that our stock is owned by tax-exempt \u201cdisqualified organizations,\u201d such as certain government-related entities and charitable remainder trusts that are not subject to tax on unrelated business income, we may incur a corporate level tax on a portion of any excess inclusion income. Because this tax generally would be imposed on us, all of our stockholders, including stockholders that are not disqualified organizations, generally would bear a portion of the tax cost associated with the classification of us or a portion of our assets as a taxable mortgage pool. A RIC, or other pass-through entity owning our stock in record name will be subject to tax at the highest U.S. federal corporate tax rate on any excess inclusion income allocated to their owners that are disqualified organizations. Moreover, we could face limitations in selling equity interests in these securitizations to outside investors, or selling any debt securities issued in connection with these securitizations that might be considered to be equity interests for tax purposes. Finally, if we were to fail to maintain our REIT qualification, any taxable mortgage pool securitizations would be treated as separate taxable corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes that could not be included in any consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. These limitations may prevent us from using certain techniques to maximize our returns from securitization transactions.\nIn the future, Residential could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise equity capital to fund its distributions or to make a portion of its distributions in the form of a taxable stock distribution.\nResidential's Board of Directors has the sole discretion to determine the timing, form and amount of any distributions to its stockholders, and the amount of such distributions may be limited. In the future, Residential could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise equity capital to fund its distributions or to make a portion of its distributions in the form of a taxable stock distribution. Residential's Board of Directors will make determinations regarding distributions based upon various factors, including its historical and projected financial condition and requirements, liquidity and results of operations, financing covenants, maintenance of its REIT qualification, applicable law and other factors, as its Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. To the extent that Residential is required to sell assets in adverse market conditions or borrow funds at unfavorable rates, it could be materially and adversely affected. To the extent Residential may have to raise equity capital, it may be unable to do so at attractive prices, on a timely basis or at all, which could adversely affect its ability to make distributions to its stockholders. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nEven if Residential qualifies as a REIT, it may be subject to tax liabilities that could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nEven if Residential qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on its income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and state or local income, property and transfer taxes. In addition, Residential could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise tax or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more of the relief provisions under the Code to maintain its qualification as a REIT. In order to meet the REIT qualification requirements or to avert the imposition of a 100% tax that applies to certain gains derived by a REIT from sales of \u201cdealer property,\u201d Residential may also move or hold some of its assets or conduct activities through a TRS. In addition, if Residential lends money to a TRS, the TRS may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid to Residential, which could result in an even higher corporate level tax liability. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to Residential's stockholders.\nFurthermore, the Code imposes a 100% tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm\u2019s length basis. We will structure Residential's transaction with any TRS on terms that we believe are arm\u2019s length to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurances, however, that Residential will be able to avoid application of the 100% tax. Any such additional tax liabilities would have an adverse effect on Residential and us.\n(table of contents)\nResidential may be subject to legislative or regulatory tax changes that could materially and adversely affect Residential.\nAt any time, the federal income tax laws or regulations governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively. Residential and its stockholders could be materially and adversely affected by any such change in or any new, federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate incentive management fees.\nOur planned use of taxable REIT subsidiaries by Residential may cause it to fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nThe net income of Residential's TRSs is not required to be distributed to Residential, and income that is not distributed to Residential generally will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. However, there may be limitations on Residential's ability to accumulate earnings in its TRSs and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in its TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the accumulation of cash in Residential's TRSs causes the fair market value of its securities in our TRSs and certain other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of its assets, it would fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nRisks related to our common stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.\nThe price at which our common stock trades has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, significantly. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to many things, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nvariations in actual or anticipated results of our operations, liquidity or financial condition;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or the failure to meet, our financial estimates or those of by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nactions or announcements by our competitors;\n\u2022\npotential conflicts of interest, or the discontinuance of our strategic relationships with Residential, Altisource and Ocwen;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated accounting problem;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions;\n\u2022\nlack of liquidity;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial condition or stock price of Residential;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market outlook for the real estate, mortgage or housing markets;\n\u2022\ntechnology changes in our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates that lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher yield;\n\u2022\nactions by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions, including an economic slowdown or dislocation in the global credit markets;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT;\n\u2022\nfailure of Residential to qualify or maintain qualification as a REIT;\n\u2022\nfailure of Residential to maintain its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\npassage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry; and\n\u2022\ndeparture of our key personnel.\nThe market prices of securities of asset management service providers have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of these companies. These market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nFurthermore, our small size and different investment characteristics may not continue to appeal to our current investor base that may seek to dispose of large amounts of our common stock. There is no assurance that there will be sufficient buying interest to offset those sales, and, accordingly, the market price of our common stock could be depressed and/or experience periods of high volatility.\n(table of contents)", "PERMNO": 14127, "SIC": 6500, "TIC": "AAMC"}
