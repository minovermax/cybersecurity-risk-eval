{"cik": "826683", "company": "Merriman Holdings, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1a. Risk Factors\nWe face a variety of risks in our business, many of which are substantial and inherent in our business and operations. The following are risk factors that could affect our business which we consider material to our industry and to holders of our common stock. Other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including reports which are incorporated by reference, may include additional factors which could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be able to achieve a positive cash flow and profitability.\nOur ability to achieve a positive cash flow and profitability depends on our ability to generate and maintain greater revenue while incurring reasonable expenses. This, in turn, depends, among other things, on the successful shift from a transaction oriented business to service oriented business. It also depends on the continued development of our investment banking, securities brokerage business, continued growth in our Capital Markets Advisory Group (CMAG) and our Financial Entrepreneur Platform. We may be unable to achieve profitability if we fail to do any of the following:\n\u00b7 establish, maintain, and increase our client base;\n\u00b7 manage the quality of our services;\n\u00b7 compete effectively with existing and potential competitors;\n\u00b7 further develop our business activities;\n\u00b7 attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u00b7 limit operating costs; and\n\u00b7 maintain adequate working capital.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve a positive cash flow and profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Our inability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow could result in disappointing financial results, impede implementation of our growth strategy, or cause the market price of our common stock to decrease. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate the cash flow and profits necessary to sustain our business.\nWe have had a number of structural changes to our operations as we divested certain non-core business lines to focus on our core service and product offerings. Additionally, there have been a number of significant challenges faced by the securities and financial industries in the past five years. As a result of our structural changes and the uncertainty of the current economic environment, the factors upon which we are able to base our estimates as to the gross revenue and the number of participating clients that will be required for us to maintain a positive cash flow are unpredictable. For these and other reasons, we cannot assure you that we will not require higher gross revenue and an increased number of clients, securities brokerage, and investment banking transactions, and/or more time in order for us to complete the development of our business that we believe we need to be able to cover our operating expenses. It is more likely than not that our estimates will prove to be inaccurate because actual events more often than not differ from anticipated events. Furthermore, in the event that financing is needed in addition to the amount that is required for this development, we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may not be able to continue operating our business\nThe Company incurred significant losses in 2014 and 2013. Even if we are successful in executing our plans, we will not be capable of sustaining losses such as those incurred in 2014 and 2013. The Company\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations is highly dependent on market and economic conditions. We also recorded net losses in certain quarters within other past fiscal years. If operating conditions worsen in 2015, we may not have the resources to meet our financial obligations. If the Company is not able to continue in business, the entire investment of our common shareholders may be at risk, and there can be no assurance that any proceeds shareholders would receive in liquidation would be equal to their investment in the Company, or even that shareholders would receive any proceeds in consideration of their common stock.\nPrior claims on assets in liquidation\nThere can be no assurance that there will be any proceeds available in liquidation for our common shareholders after payments to holders of our Secured Promissory Notes and Unsecured Promissory Notes.\nCommon shareholders may receive nothing in liquidation or receive much less than they would if there were no Secured Promissory Notes and Unsecured Promissory Notes outstanding.\nLimitations on our access to capital and our ability to comply with net capital requirements could impair our ability to conduct our business\nLiquidity, or ready access to funds, is essential to financial services firms. Failures of financial institutions have often been attributable in large part to insufficient liquidity. Liquidity is of importance to our trading business, and perceived liquidity issues may affect our customers and counterparties\u2019 willingness to engage in brokerage transactions with us. Our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or operational problems that affect our trading capability.\nMC, our broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to the net capital requirements of the SEC and various self-regulatory organizations of which it is a member. These requirements typically specify the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also mandate that a significant part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Any failure to comply with these net capital requirements could impair our ability to conduct our core business as a brokerage firm. Furthermore, MC is subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to prevent or reduce the flow of funds from it to Merriman Holdings, Inc. As a holding company, Merriman Holdings, Inc. depends on distributions and other payments from its subsidiary to fund all payments on its obligations. As a result, regulatory actions could impede access to funds that Merriman Holdings, Inc. needs to make payments on obligations, including debt obligations.\nFactors which could impede our ability to access additional capital include the recent extreme volatility in the equity markets and our recent operating results. If we are not able to access additional capital, we might not be able to meet our obligations in a timely manner, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its intended business objectives.\nOur exposure to legal liability may be significant, and damages that we may be required to pay and the reputation harm that could result from legal action against us could materially adversely affect our businesses.\nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses and, in recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have been increasing. These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions, potential liability for \u201cfairness opinions\u201d and other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions and disputes over the terms and conditions of trading arrangements. We are also subject to claims arising from disputes with employees for alleged discrimination or harassment, among other things. These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time.\nOur role as advisor to our clients on important underwriting or mergers and acquisitions transactions involves complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment, including rendering \u201cfairness opinions\u201d in connection with mergers and other transactions. Therefore, our activities may subject us to the risk of significant legal liabilities to our clients and third parties, including shareholders of our clients who could bring securities class actions against us. Our investment banking engagements typically include broad indemnities from our clients and provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services, but these provisions may not protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases.\nFor example, an indemnity from a client that subsequently is placed into bankruptcy is likely to be of little value to us in limiting our exposure to claims relating to that client. As a result, we may incur significant legal and other expenses in defending against litigation and may be required to pay substantial damages for settlements and adverse judgments. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cause significant reputation harm to us, which could seriously harm our business and prospects.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation often has been instituted against many broker-dealers. Such litigation is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to such litigation. If we are subject to such litigation, even if we ultimately prevail, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur business and prospects increasingly rely on new business lines and new ways of doing business.\nOur business and financial prospects rely in part on new and unproven business lines and ways of doing business, including the Digital Capital Network. Since they are new, it may be difficult to evaluate prospects for future business from such sources. Any failure of such business lines and ways of doing business to evolve in the manner expected could adversely affect our stock price, financial condition and prospects. An increasing percentage of our revenue producers are independent contractors rather than employees of the Company. Such contractors may be more likely to sever their relationships with the Company than the employees we have typically relied on in the past, and if they do so, they may be more likely to take important client relationships with them. Furthermore, such contractors may work more independently from the Company than employees typically have and may be more likely to work from remote locations rather than from the Company\u2019s two office locations. These factors may increase the risk of claims and litigation arising from the actions of such independent contractors.\nOur financial results may fluctuate substantially from period to period, which may impair our stock price.\nWe have experienced, and expect to experience in the future, significant periodic variations in our revenue and results of operations. These variations may be attributed in part to the fact that our investment banking revenue is typically earned upon the successful completion of a transaction, the timing of which is uncertain and beyond our control. In most cases we receive little or no payment for investment banking engagements that do not result in the successful completion of a transaction. As a result, our business is highly dependent on market conditions as well as the decisions and actions of our clients and interested third parties. For example, a client\u2019s acquisition transaction may be delayed or terminated because of a failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty, failure to obtain necessary regulatory consents or board or shareholder approvals, failure to secure necessary financing, adverse market conditions, or unexpected financial or other problems in the client\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s business. If the parties fail to complete a transaction on which we are advising or an offering in which we are participating, we will earn little or no revenue from the transaction.\nDue to many factors, including the increased regulatory burden on corporate issuers, there have been fewer initial public offerings of securities of U.S. based companies. Consequently, many fast-growing companies have found a more cost effective method to attract capital through listing on the OTCQX. More companies initiating the process of an initial public offering are also simultaneously exploring merger and acquisition opportunities. If we are not engaged as a strategic advisor in any such dual-tracked process, our investment banking revenue would be adversely affected in the event that an initial public offering is not consummated.\nAs a result, we are unlikely to achieve steady and predictable earnings on a quarterly basis, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price.\nOur ability to retain our professionals and recruit additional professionals is critical to the success of our business, and our failure to do so could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, and results of operations.\nOur ability to obtain and successfully execute our business depends upon the personal reputation, judgment, business generation capabilities and project execution skills of our senior professionals, particularly D. Jonathan Merriman, our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Merriman Holdings, Inc., and the other senior professionals. Our senior professionals\u2019 personal reputations and relationships with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and executing client engagements. We face intense competition for qualified employees from other companies in the investment banking industry as well as from businesses outside the investment banking industry, such as investment advisory firms, hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds. From time to time, we have experienced losses of investment banking, brokerage, research, and other professionals and losses of our key personnel may occur in the future. The departure or other loss of Mr. Merriman or any other senior professionals who manage substantial client relationships and possess substantial experience and expertise, could impair our ability to secure or successfully complete engagements, or protect our market share, each of which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf any of our professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company, some of our clients could choose to leave. The compensation plans and other incentive plans we have entered into with certain of our professionals may not prove effective in preventing them from resigning to join our competitors. If we are unable to retain our professionals or recruit additional professionals, our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur compensation structure may negatively impact our financial condition if we are not able to effectively manage our expenses and cash flows.\nHistorically, the industry has been able to attract and retain investment banking, research, and sales and trading professionals in part because the business models have provided for lucrative compensation packages. Compensation and benefits are our largest expenditure and the variable compensation component, or bonus, has represented a significant proportion of this expense. The Company\u2019s bonus compensation is discretionary. For 2014, the potential pool was determined by a number of components including revenue production, key operating milestones, and profitability. There is a potential, in order to ensure retention of key employees, that we could pay individuals for revenue production despite the business having negative cash flows and/or net losses.\nPricing and other competitive pressures may impair the revenue and profitability of our brokerage business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from our brokerage business. Along with other brokerage firms, we have experienced intense price competition in this business in recent years. Recent developments in the brokerage industry, including decimalization and the growth of electronic communications networks, or ECNs, have reduced commission rates and profitability in the brokerage industry. We expect this trend toward alternative trading systems to continue. We believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price.\nIn addition, we face pressure from larger competitors, which may be better able to offer a broader range of complementary products and services to brokerage customers in order to win their trading business.\nFinally, certain large U.S. based broker-dealer firms operate under capital requirements which are less restrictive than the regulatory capital requirements we face, which puts smaller investment banks such as our Company at a competitive disadvantage in the market place.\nWe may experience significant losses if the value of our marketable security positions deteriorates.\nWe conduct active and aggressive securities trading, market making, and investment activities for our own account, which subjects our capital to significant risks. These risks include market, credit, counterparty, and liquidity risks, which could result in losses. These activities often involve the purchase, sale, or short sale of securities as principal in markets that may be characterized as relatively illiquid or that may be particularly susceptible to rapid fluctuations in liquidity and price. Trading losses resulting from such activities could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDifficult market conditions could adversely affect our business in many ways.\nDifficult market and economic conditions and geopolitical uncertainties have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business and profitability in many ways. Weakness in equity markets and diminished trading volume of securities could adversely impact our brokerage business, from which we have historically generated more than half of our revenue. Industry-wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and mergers and acquisitions also would likely have an adverse effect on our revenue. In addition, reductions in the trading prices for equity securities also tend to reduce the deal value of investment banking transactions, such as underwriting and mergers and acquisitions transactions, which in turn may reduce the fees we earn from these transactions. As we may be unable to reduce expenses correspondingly, our profits and profit margins may decline.\nWe may suffer losses through our investments in securities purchased in secondary market transactions or private placements.\nOccasionally, our Company, its officers and/or employees may make principal investments in securities through secondary market transactions or through direct investment in companies through private placements. In many cases, employees and officers with investment discretion on behalf of our Company decide whether to invest in our account or their personal account. It is possible that gains from investing will accrue to these individuals because investments were made in their personal accounts, and our Company will not realize gains because it did not make an investment. It is possible that gains from investing will accrue to these individuals and /or to the Company, while the Company\u2019s brokerage customers do not accrue gains in the same securities due to differences in timing of investment decisions. Conversely, it is possible that losses from investing will accrue to our Company, while these individuals do not experience losses in their personal accounts because the individuals did not make investments in their personal accounts.\nWe face strong competition from larger firms.\nThe brokerage and investment banking industries are intensely competitive. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including client relationships, reputation, the abilities and past performance of our professionals, market focus and the relative quality and price of our services and products. We have experienced intense price competition with respect to our brokerage business, including large block trades, spreads, and trading commissions. Pricing and other competitive pressures in investment banking, including the trends toward multiple book runners, co-managers, and multiple financial advisors handling transactions, have continued and could adversely affect our revenue, even during periods where the volume and number of investment banking transactions are increasing. We believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price.\nWe are a small investment bank with 31 employees as of December 31, 2014 and revenues of approximately $16 million in 2014. Many of our competitors in the investment banking and brokerage industries have a broader range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, greater name recognition, more senior professionals to serve their clients\u2019 needs, greater global reach, have more established relationships with clients than we have, and some operate under less restrictive capital requirements. These larger and better capitalized competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the brokerage and investment banking industries, to compete for skilled professionals, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth, and to compete for market share generally.\nThe scale of our competitors has increased in recent years as a result of substantial consolidation among companies in the investment banking and brokerage industries. In addition, a number of large commercial banks, insurance companies, and other broad-based financial services firms have established or acquired underwriting or financial advisory practices and broker-dealers or have merged with other financial institutions. These firms operate under less restrictive capital requirements than we do and these firms have the ability to offer a wider range of products than we do, which enhances their competitive position. They also have the ability to support investment banking with commercial banking, insurance, and other financial services in an effort to gain market share, which has resulted, and could further result, in pricing pressure in our businesses. In particular, the ability to provide financing has become an important advantage for some of our larger competitors and, because we do not provide such financing, we may be unable to compete as effectively for clients in a significant part of the brokerage and investment banking market.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred losses for the period covered by this report in the recent past and may incur losses in the future.\nThe Company recorded net losses of $1,628,000 and $3,392,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. We also recorded net losses in certain quarters within other past fiscal years. We may incur losses in future periods. If we are unable to finance future losses, those losses may have a significant effect on our liquidity as well as our ability to operate.\nIn addition, the Company may incur significant expenses in connection with initiating new business activities or in connection with any expansion of our underwriting, brokerage, or other businesses. We may also engage in strategic acquisitions and investments for which we may incur significant expenses. Accordingly, we may need to increase our revenue at a rate greater than our expenses to achieve and maintain profitability. If our revenue does not increase sufficiently, or even if our revenue does increase but we are unable to manage our expenses, we will not achieve and maintain profitability in future periods.\nCapital markets and strategic advisory engagements are singular in nature and do not generally provide for subsequent engagements.\nThe ability to complete capital raising transactions for our clients is significantly affected by the state of the capital markets in general. Additionally, our investment banking clients generally retain us on a short-term, engagement-by-engagement basis in connection with specific capital markets or mergers and acquisitions transactions, rather than on a recurring basis under long-term contracts. As these transactions are typically singular in nature and our engagements with these clients may not recur, we must seek out new engagements when our current engagements are successfully completed or are terminated. As a result, high activity levels in any period are not necessarily indicative of continued high levels of activity in any subsequent period. If we are unable to generate a substantial number of new engagements and generate fees from those successful completion of transactions, our business and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.\nOur risk management policies and procedures could expose us to unidentified or unanticipated risk.\nOur risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties who owe us money, securities, or other assets will not fulfill their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure, breach of contract, or other reasons. We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses, or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us. Also, risk management policies and procedures that we utilize with respect to investing our own funds or committing our capital with respect to investment banking or trading activities may not protect us or mitigate our risks from those activities. If any of the variety of instruments, processes, and strategies we utilize to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses.\nOur operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail.\nOur business is highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of increasingly complex transactions across diverse markets. Our financial, accounting, or other data processing systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communication services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people, or systems, we could suffer impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, and disruption of our businesses, liabilities to clients, regulatory intervention, or reputation damage.\nWe also face the risk of operational failure of any of our clearing agents, the exchanges, clearing houses, or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions. Any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions and to manage our exposure to risk.\nIn addition, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communication, transportation, or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, whether due to fire, other natural disaster, power or communication failure, act of terrorism or war or otherwise. Nearly all of our employees in our primary locations, including San Francisco and New York, work in proximity to each other. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer and we may not be able to implement successfully contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. Insurance policies to mitigate these risks may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit. Further, any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain of these risks may not cover our loss.\nOur operations also rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential and other information processed by, stored in, and transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients\u2019, our counterparties\u2019, or third parties\u2019 operations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\nEvaluation of our prospects may be more difficult in light of our operating history.\nAs a result of the volatile economic conditions faced by the securities and financial industries, and the restructuring of our business lines, there have been a number of changes to our operations. Given these changes, we can no longer rely upon prior operating history to evaluate our business and prospects. Additionally, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties that face a company in the process of restructuring its business in the midst of uncertain economic environment. Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to attract and retain employees and clients on a cost-effective basis, expand and enhance our service offerings, raise additional capital, and respond to competitive market conditions. We may not be able to address these risks adequately, and our failure to do so may adversely affect our business and the value of an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nRisks associated with volatility and losses in the financial markets.\nIn the last decade, the U.S. financial markets have experienced tremendous volatility and uncertainty. Several mortgage-related financial institutions and large, reputable investment banks were not able to continue operating their businesses. In the event that the securities and financial industries face similar or greater volatility, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue our operations.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us and is difficult to detect and deter.\nThere have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years. There is potential risk that employee misconduct could occur at our Company. For example, misconduct by employees could involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputation or financial harm to us. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct. The precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases and we may suffer significant reputation harm for any misconduct by our employees.\nRisks associated with regulatory impact on capital markets.\nHighly publicized financial scandals in recent years have led to investor concerns over the integrity of the U.S. financial markets and have prompted Congress, the SEC, the NYSE, and FINRA to significantly expand corporate governance and public disclosure requirements. To the extent that private companies, in order to avoid becoming subject to these new requirements, decide to forgo initial public offerings, our equity underwriting business may be adversely affected. In addition, provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the corporate governance rules imposed by self-regulatory organizations have diverted many companies\u2019 attention away from capital market transactions, including securities offerings and acquisition and disposition transactions. In particular, companies that are or are planning to register their securities with the SEC or to become subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are incurring significant expenses in complying with the SEC and accounting standards relating to internal control over financial reporting, and companies that disclose material weaknesses in such controls under the new standards may have greater difficulty accessing the capital markets. These factors, in addition to adopted or proposed accounting and disclosure changes, may have an adverse effect on the business.\nFinancial services firms have been subject to increased scrutiny over the last several years, increasing the risk of financial liability and reputation harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions.\nFirms in the financial services industry have been operating in a differentiated and difficult regulatory environment. The industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators, including the SEC, the NYSE, FINRA and state attorneys general. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years. This regulatory and enforcement environment has created uncertainty with respect to a number of transactions that had historically been entered into by financial services firms and that were generally believed to be permissible and appropriate. We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. We also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC and other United States or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. Among other things, we could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputation harm to us, which could seriously harm our business prospects.\nIn addition, financial services firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interests or perceived conflicts. The SEC and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts and regularly seek to review and update our policies, controls and procedures. However, appropriate dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. Our policies and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts may also result in increased costs, additional operational personnel and increased regulatory risk. Failure to adhere to these policies and procedures may result in regulatory sanctions or client litigation. For example, the research areas of investment banks have been and remain the subject of heightened regulatory scrutiny which has led to increased restrictions on the interaction between equity research analysts and investment banking personnel at securities firms. Several securities firms in the United States reached a global settlement in 2003 and 2004 with certain federal and state securities regulators and self-regulatory organizations to resolve investigations into equity research analysts\u2019 alleged conflicts of interest. Under this settlement, the firms have been subject to certain restrictions and undertakings, which have imposed additional costs and limitations on the conduct of our businesses.\nFinancial service companies have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries concerning market timing, late trading and other activities that focus on the mutual fund industry. These inquiries have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds, investment advisers, and broker-dealers.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nInvestor interest in our firm may be diluted due to issuance of additional shares of common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without shareholder approval in certain circumstances. Future issuance of additional shares of our common stock could be at values substantially below the price at which you may purchase our stock and, therefore, could represent substantial dilution. In addition, our Board of Directors could issue large blocks of our common stock to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further shareholder approval.\nThe table below represents a list of potentially dilutive securities outstanding as of:\nIn addition to the potentially dilutive securities listed above, the total number of common shares outstanding as of March 24, 2015\nwas 4,518,633.\nThe exercise of the outstanding options and warrants would dilute the then-existing shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership of our common stock. Any sales resulting from the exercise of options and warrants in the public market could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Moreover, our ability to obtain additional equity capital could be adversely affected since the holders of outstanding options and warrants may exercise them at a time when we would also wish to enter the market to obtain capital on terms more favorable than those provided by such options and warrants. We lack control over the timing of any exercise or the number of shares issued or sold if exercises occur.\nA significant percentage of our outstanding common stock is owned or controlled by senior members of our firm and other employees and their interests may differ from those of other shareholders.\nOur executive officers and directors, and entities affiliated with them, currently control approximately 52% of our outstanding common stock including exercise of their options and associated warrants. These shareholders, if they act together, will be able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us and might affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions of the organizational documents may discourage an acquisition of us.\nIn addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law contains provisions that may enable our management to retain control and resist a takeover of the Company. These provisions generally prevent us from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with an owner of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years from the date that such person acquires his or her stock. Accordingly, these provisions could discourage or make more difficult a change in control or a merger or other type of corporate reorganization even if it could be favorable to the interests of our shareholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, volatile. A variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including:\n\u00b7 variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 announcements of significant contracts, milestones, and acquisitions;\n\u00b7 relationships with other companies;\n\u00b7 ability to obtain needed capital commitments;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 sales of common and preferred stock, conversion of securities convertible into common stock, exercise of options and warrants to purchase common stock, or termination of stock transfer restrictions;\n\u00b7 general economic conditions, including conditions in the securities brokerage and investment banking markets;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; and\n\u00b7 fluctuations in stock market price and trading volume.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Any one of the factors noted herein could have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock. Declines in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key employees, including our senior professionals.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These market fluctuations have adversely impacted the price of our common stock in the past and may do so in the future.\nYour ability to sell your shares may be restricted because there is a limited trading market for our common stock.\nAn active trading market in our stock has been limited.
