RISK FACTORS\nThe continued uncertain economic environment may adversely affect our business.\nSpending on IT consulting and analytics services is largely discretionary and will decline during economic downturns or periods of economic uncertainty when the Company\u2019s clients are operating under reduced budgets, including during the current period. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues are derived from sales to clients in the financial services, banking and insurance industries. Many of the Company\u2019s major clients in the financial services industry came under significant financial pressure as a result of the recent economic crisis. If the period of economic uncertainty continues or if the economic environment worsens it could further erode the Company\u2019s ability to sell future projects.\nWe rely on a concentrated client base for much of our revenue.\nWe rely on a small number of clients for a significant portion of our revenue. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, our top three clients accounted for 78% and 88% respectively of our revenue. If we were to lose any of these clients, we cannot assure you that they could be replaced quickly or at all. Our loss of any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s stock was traded on 219 days during 2014 and may be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to variations in quarterly results of operations and other factors, including financings, technological innovations and general economic or market conditions. For example, the closing price of our common stock during 2014 was as low as $1.70 and as high as $7.30. Stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume trading volatility in the recent past. This volatility had a substantial effect on the market price of many technology companies that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. This volatility may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nOur industry is subject to rapid change.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service introductions, evolving distribution channels and changing customer demands. We must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop information technology solutions to meet client expectations, and offer services and solutions that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving industry standards and changing client preferences. If we are unable to keep up with technological changes and changes in industry standards, our business, reputation and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is intensely competitive.\nThe market for IT consulting and analytic services is intensely competitive, affected by rapid technological advances and includes a large number of competitors. Our competitors include the current or former consulting divisions of the \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms, major offshore outsourcing companies, systems consulting and implementation firms, application software development firms, management consulting firms, divisions of large computer hardware and software companies, and niche providers of IT services. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. Competition imposes significant pricing pressures on us. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our business and financial results will be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.\nWe rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property, but there can be no assurance that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nInfringement on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly.\nThird parties may claim that we violated their intellectual property rights. To the extent of a violation of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned, and may be required to pay damages, to obtain a license, if available, or to use a non-infringing method if possible, to accomplish our objectives. Any of these claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel from our day-to-day operations. If such claims are successful, they could result in costly judgments or settlements.", "PERMNO": 85320, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "HMNY"}
