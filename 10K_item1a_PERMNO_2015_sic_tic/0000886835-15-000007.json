{"cik": "886835", "company": "SUPERIOR ENERGY SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in Part II, Item 7 and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as, in conjunction with the matters contained under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following discussion of \u201crisk factors\u201d identifies the most significant risks or uncertainties that could (i) materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects, as well as the market value of our securities, or (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. These risks include:\nOur business depends on conditions in the oil and gas industry, especially oil and gas prices and capital expenditures by oil and natural gas companies.\nOur business depends on the level of oil and gas exploration, development and production activity by oil and gas companies worldwide. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and gas prices, which historically have been volatile and difficult to predict. Oil and gas prices are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, economic growth trends, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors beyond our control. Lower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers. While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers. Our customers may also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk. Any of these factors could significantly affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nThe availability of quality drilling prospects, exploration success, relative production costs, expectations about future oil and gas demand, the stage of reservoir development, the availability of financing, and political and regulatory environments are also expected to affect levels of exploration, development, and production activity, which would impact the demand for our services. Worldwide military, political and economic events have in the past contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to do so in the future. Any prolonged reduction of oil and gas prices, as well as anticipated declines, could also result in lower levels of exploration, development, and production activity. The demand for our services may be affected by numerous factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\ndemand for energy, which is affected by worldwide economic activity, population growth and market expectations regarding future trends;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other key oil-producing countries to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u00b7\nthe level of excess production capacity;\n\u00b7\nthe discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and global political and economic uncertainty, socio-political unrest and instability, terrorism or hostilities;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and changes in weather patterns, including summer and winter temperatures that impact demand;\n\u00b7\nthe availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities;\n\u00b7\nthe level and effect of trading in commodity future markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others;\n\u00b7\ndemand for and availability of alternative, competing sources of energy;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which taxes, tax credits, environmental regulations, auctions of mineral rights, drilling permits, drilling concessions, drilling moratoriums or other governmental regulations, actions or policies affect the production, cost of production, price or availability of petroleum products and alternative energy sources; and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy exploration, production and consumption.\nAny extended period of low oil and gas prices could depress the level of oil and gas exploration and production activity in our markets, and thus reduce the demand for our products and services. Moreover, weakness in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact the financial position of our customers, which in turn could cause them to fail to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner or at all. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThere are operating hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry that could expose us to substantial liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry that may lead to property damage, personal injury, death or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. Many of these events are outside of our control. Typically, we provide products and services at a well site where our personnel and equipment are located together with personnel and equipment of our customer and other service providers. From time to time, personnel are injured or equipment or property is damaged or destroyed as a result of accidents, failed equipment, faulty products or services, failure of safety measures, uncontained formation pressures or other dangers inherent in oil and gas exploration, development and production. Any of these events can be the result of human error or purely accidental, and it may be difficult or impossible to definitively determine the ultimate cause of the event or whose personnel or equipment contributed thereto. All of these risks expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks and potentially substantial litigation claims for damages. With increasing frequency, our products and services are deployed in more challenging exploration, development and production environments. From time to time, customers and third parties may seek to hold us accountable for damages and costs incurred as a result of an accident, including pollution, even under circumstances where we believe we did not cause or contribute to the accident. Our insurance policies are subject to exclusions, limitations and other conditions, and may not protect us against liability for some types of events, including events involving a well blowout, or against losses from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate or on terms that we deem commercially reasonable. Any damages or losses that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles or retentions, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be fully indemnified against losses incurred due to catastrophic events.\nAs is customary in our industry, our contracts generally provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our customers from any claims arising from personal injury or death of our employees, damage to or loss of our equipment, and pollution emanating from our equipment and services. Similarly, our customers generally agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from personal injury or death of their employees, damage to or loss of their equipment, and pollution caused from their equipment or the well reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir). Our indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case. For example, from time to time we may enter into contracts with less favorable indemnities or perform work without a contract that protects us. In addition, our indemnification rights may not fully protect us if we cannot prove that we are entitled to be indemnified or if the customer is bankrupt or insolvent, does not maintain adequate insurance or otherwise does not possess sufficient resources to indemnify us. In addition, our indemnification rights may be held unenforceable in some jurisdictions.\nOur customers\u2019 changing views on risk allocation could cause us to accept greater risk to win new business or could result in us losing business if we are not prepared to take such risks. To the extent that we accept such additional risk, and seek to insure against it, our insurance premiums could rise.\nLower capital spending by our customers could affect demand and pricing for our services which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is directly affected by changes in capital expenditures by our customers, and reductions in their capital spending will generally reduce demand for our services and products. The steep decline in oil prices in late 2014 has caused several of our customers to announce capital spending or production cuts or to delay their planning regarding future spending or production. The rate of economic growth in the U.S. and worldwide has not reached the levels experienced since before the 2008 economic downturn. Prolonged periods of little or no economic growth will likely decrease demand for oil and gas and increase pricing pressure for our services and products. In addition, if a significant number of our customers experience a prolonged business decline or disruptions, we may incur increased exposure to credit risk and bad debts.\nIncreased regulation of or limiting or banning hydraulic fracturing could reduce or eliminate demand for our pressure pumping services.\nOur hydraulic fracturing services are subject to a range of applicable federal, state and local laws. Our hydraulic fracturing services are designed and operated to minimize the risk, if any, of subsurface migration of hydraulic fracturing fluids and spillage or mishandling of hydraulic fracturing fluids. However, a proven case of subsurface migration of hydraulic fracturing fluids or a case of spillage or mishandling of hydraulic fracturing fluids during these activities could potentially subject us to civil or criminal liability and the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\npossibility of substantial remediation costs, depending on the circumstances of the underground migration, spillage, or mishandling, the nature and scope of the underground migration, spillage, or mishandling, and the applicable laws and regulations.\nThe practice of hydraulically fracturing formations to stimulate the production of natural gas and oil remains under increased scrutiny from federal, state and local governmental authorities. Various federal legislative and regulatory initiatives have been undertaken which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, the U.S. Department of Interior has issued proposed regulations that would apply to hydraulic fracturing wells subject to federal oil and gas leases that would impose requirements to disclose chemicals used in the fracturing process as well as certain prior approvals to conduct hydraulic fracturing. In addition, a few states and municipalities have banned fracturing operations in their jurisdictions, and others are contemplating similar actions. Moreover, certain other states have adopted laws and regulations requiring additional disclosure regarding chemicals used in the fracturing process, and other states are evaluating the adoption of legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing. Possible legislation or regulation could impose further requirements or limitations, such as restrictions on the use of certain chemicals or prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas, which could affect our operations. The adoption of any future federal, state or local laws or regulations could adversely affect our hydraulic fracturing business.\nAdverse and unusual weather conditions may affect our operations.\nOur operations may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. Severe weather, such as hurricanes, high winds and seas, blizzards and extreme temperatures may cause evacuation of personnel, curtailment of services and suspension of operations, inability to deliver materials to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules, loss of or damage to equipment and facilities and reduced productivity. In addition, variations from normal weather patterns can have a significant impact on demand for oil and gas, thereby reducing demand for our services and equipment.\nAny capital financing that may be necessary may not be available at economic rates or at all.\nTurmoil in the credit and financial markets could adversely affect financial institutions, inhibit lending and limit our access to funding through borrowings under our credit facility or newly created facilities in the public or private capital markets on terms we believe to be reasonable. Prevailing market conditions could be adversely affected by the ongoing disruptions in domestic or overseas sovereign or corporate debt markets, low oil prices or other factors impacting our business, contractions or limited growth in the economy or other similar adverse economic developments in the U.S. or abroad. Instability in the global financial markets has from time to time resulted in periodic volatility in the capital markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Any such failure to obtain additional financing could jeopardize our ability to repay, refinance or reduce our debt obligations, or to meet our other financial commitments.\nOur inability to retain key employees and skilled workers could adversely affect our operations.\nOur performance could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain certain key employees and skilled technical personnel. Our ability to continue to expand the scope of our services and products depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to employ or retain skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operating results. Over the past several years, the demand for skilled personnel has been high and the supply limited. We have experienced increases in labor costs in recent years and may continue to do so in the future.\nOur international operations and revenue are affected by political, economic and other uncertainties worldwide.\nIn 2014, we conducted business in more than 70 countries, and we intend to expand our international operations.\nOur foreign operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which we provide services. Local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement, differ significantly among those jurisdictions, and can change significantly over time. Future regulatory, judicial and legislative changes or interpretations may have a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver services within various foreign jurisdictions.\nIn addition to these international regulatory risks, our international operations are subject to a number of other risks inherent in any business operating in foreign countries, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\npolitical, social and economic instability;\n\u00b7\npotential expropriation, seizure or nationalization of assets;\n\u00b7\ninflation;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ndeprivation of contract rights;\n\u00b7\nincreased operating costs;\n\u00b7\ninability to collect receivables;\n\u00b7\ncivil unrest and protests, strikes, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict;\n\u00b7\nimport-export quotas or restrictions, including the risk of fines or penalties assessed for violations;\n\u00b7\nconfiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange controls;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations, devaluations and conversion restrictions;\n\u00b7\npotential submission of disputes to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel;\n\u00b7\npandemics or epidemics that disrupt our ability to transport personnel or equipment;\n\u00b7\nembargoes or other restrictive governmental actions that could limit our ability to operate in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nadditional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) as well as other anti-corruption laws;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the repatriation of funds;\n\u00b7\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of unanticipated or increased environmental and safety regulations or other forms of public or governmental regulation that increase our operating expenses; and\n\u00b7\nchallenges in staffing and managing foreign operations.\nThese and the other risks outlined above could cause us to curtail or terminate operations, result in the loss of personnel or assets, disrupt financial and commercial markets and generate greater political and economic instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate. International areas where we operate that have significant risk include the Middle East, Colombia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Mexico and Azerbaijan.\nLaws, regulations or practices in foreign countries could materially restrict our operations or expose us to additional risks.\nIn many countries around the world where we do business, all or a significant portion of the decision making regarding procuring our services and products is controlled by state-owned oil companies. State-owned oil companies or prevailing laws may (i) require us to meet local content or hiring requirements or other local standards, (ii) restrict with whom we can contract or (iii) otherwise limit the scope of operations that we can legally or practically conduct. Our inability or failure to meet these requirements, standards or restrictions may adversely impact our operations in those countries. In addition, our ability to work with state-owned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms, and to enforce those terms. In addition, many state-owned oil companies may require integrated contracts or turnkey contracts that could require us to provide services outside its core business. Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis generally requires us to assume additional risks.\nMoreover, in order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, it is frequently necessary or required to establish joint ventures or strategic alliances with local operators, partners or agents. In certain instances, these local operators, partners or agents may have interests that are not always aligned with ours. Reliance on local operators, partners or agents could expose us to the risk of being unable to control the scope or quality of our overseas services or products, or being held liable under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subject to the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation or prospects.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nChanges in tax laws or tax rates, adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities could impact our operating results. In addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization. If taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be impacted. The final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties and related authorities in each taxing jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates and assumptions regarding future operations and results and the timing of income and expenses. We may be audited and receive tax assessments from taxing authorities that may result in assessment of additional taxes that are ultimately resolved with the authorities or through the courts. We believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law. Resolution of any tax matter involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations which could reduce our business opportunities and revenue, and increase our costs and liabilities.\nOur business is significantly affected by a wide range of laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate, and increasingly rigorous environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management. Generally, these laws have in recent years become more stringent and have sought to impose greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties. The Macondo well explosion in 2010 resulted in additional regulation of our offshore operations, and similar onshore or offshore accidents in the future could result in additional increases in regulation.\nWe incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex and expensive to implement. For instance, a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements have been introduced by various domestic, foreign or international regulatory bodies that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, which could impose restrictions in greenhouse gas emissions. These proposals include, among others, various \u201ccap and trade,\u201d carbon tax and sequestration initiatives. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued rules regulating greenhouse emissions by oil and gas operators. At this stage, we cannot predict the impact of the EPA\u2019s recent rulemaking on our operations, nor can we predict whether, or which of, other currently pending greenhouse gas emission proposals will be adopted, or what other actions may be taken by domestic, foreign or international regulatory bodies. The potential passage of climate change regulation may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our products and services, which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations.\nFurther, environmental laws may provide for \u201cstrict liability\u201d for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. For example, our well service and fluids businesses routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials, some of which are classified as hazardous substances. We also store, transport and use radioactive and explosive materials in certain of our operations. In addition, many of our current and former facilities are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials, the use of radioactive materials, the use of underground injection wells, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new domestic or foreign laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.\nIf we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe market for oilfield services in which we operate is highly competitive and includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, as well as several large companies that possess substantially greater financial resources than we do. Contracts are traditionally awarded on the basis of competitive bids or direct negotiations with customers.\nThe market for our services and products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and services. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may be disadvantaged\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncompetitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production operations to areas of the world in which we are not currently active.\nWe are affected by global economic factors and political events.\nOur financial results depend on demand for our services and products in the U.S. and the international markets in which we operate. Declining economic conditions, or negative perceptions about economic conditions, could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our services and products. World political events could also result in further U.S. military actions, terrorist attacks and related unrest. Military action by the U. S. or other nations could escalate and further acts of terrorism may occur in the U.S. or elsewhere. Such acts of terrorism could lead to, among other things, a loss of our investment in the country, impairment of the safety of our employees, extortion or kidnapping, and impairment of our ability to conduct our operations. Such developments have caused instability in the world\u2019s financial and insurance markets in the past, and many experts believe that a confluence of worldwide factors could result in a prolonged period of economic uncertainty and slow growth in the future. In addition, any of these developments could lead to increased volatility in prices for oil and gas and could affect the markets for our products and services. Insurance premiums could also increase and coverages may be unavailable.\nUncertain economic conditions and instability make it particularly difficult for us to forecast demand trends. The timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain, and may affect demand for many of our services and products. Consequently, we may not be able to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on demand for our services and products and resulting results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or divestitures.\nWe continually seek opportunities to increase efficiency and value through various transactions, including purchases or sales of assets or businesses. These transactions are intended to result in the offering of new services or products, the generation of income or cash, the creation of efficiencies or the reduction of risk. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or any other transactions depends, in part, upon our ability to timely and efficiently integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. In addition, the financing of any future acquisition completed by us could adversely impact our capital structure or increase our leverage. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs. Except as required by law or applicable securities exchange listing standards, we do not expect to ask our shareholders to vote on any proposed acquisition or divestiture. Moreover, we generally do not announce our acquisitions or divestitures until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement.\nBusiness growth could outpace the capabilities of our infrastructure and workforce.\nWe cannot be certain that our infrastructure and workforce will be adequate to support our operations as we expand. Future growth also could impose significant additional demands on our resources, resulting in additional responsibilities of our senior management, including the need to recruit and integrate new senior level managers, executives and operating personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional personnel. Moreover, we may need to expend significant time and money in the future to integrate and unify our systems and infrastructure. To the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively, or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan.\nOur operations may be subject to cyber attacks that could have an adverse effect on our business operations.\nLike most companies, we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, to manage or support a variety of our business operations, and to maintain various records, which may include information regarding our customers, employees or other third parties. We make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and systems (and maintain contingency plans in the event of security breaches or system disruptions). We cannot provide assurance that our security efforts and measures will prevent unauthorized access to our systems, loss or destruction of data, account takeovers, or other forms of cyber-attacks or similar events, whether caused by mechanical failures, human error, fraud, malice, sabotage or otherwise. The frequency, scope and sophistication of cyber-attacks continue to grow, which increases the possibility that our security measures will be unable to prevent our systems\u2019 improper functioning or the improper disclosure of proprietary information. Any failure of our information or communications systems, whether caused by attacks, mechanical failures, natural disasters or otherwise, could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, or subject us to claims, any of which could materially adversely affect us.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be exposed to unforeseen costs in some of our projects.\nSome of our decommissioning business may be conducted under fixed-price or \u201cturnkey\u201d contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform a defined scope of work or deliver a product for a fixed price. Prices for these contracts are established based largely upon estimates and assumptions relating to project scope and specifications, personnel and material needs. These estimates and assumptions may prove inaccurate or conditions may change due to factors out of our control resulting in cost overruns. We may be required to absorb these cost overruns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates of our oil and gas reserves and potential liabilities relating to our oil and gas properties may be incorrect.\nFrom time to time, we may engage in projects that include the acquisition of oil and gas properties. Acquisitions of these properties require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control, including estimates of recoverable reserves, future oil and gas prices, operating costs and potential environmental and plugging and abandonment liabilities. These assessments are complex and inherently speculative, and, with respect to estimates of oil and gas reserves, require significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. In addition, since these properties are typically mature and could be in shallow water, our facilities and operations may be more susceptible to hurricane damage, equipment failure or mechanical problems. In connection with these assessments, we perform due diligence reviews that we believe are generally consistent with industry practices. However, our reviews may not reveal all existing or potential risks or liabilities. In addition, our reviews may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We may not always discover structural, subsurface, environmental or other problems that may exist or arise.\nActual future production, cash flows, development expenditures, operating and abandonment expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those estimated by us and any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our proved reserves. Therefore, the risk exists we may overestimate the value of economically recoverable reserves or underestimate the cost of plugging wells and abandoning production facilities. If costs of abandonment are materially greater or actual reserves are materially lower than our estimates, this could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 77763, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "SPN"}
