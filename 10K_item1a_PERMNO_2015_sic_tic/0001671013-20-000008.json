RISK FACTORS\nRisks associated with our industry\nThe proliferation of payment options and increasingly frictionless methods of payment other than cash, including credit cards, debit cards, stored-value debit cards, contactless, and mobile payments options, could result in a reduced need for cash in the marketplace and a resulting decline in the usage of our ATMs.\nThe U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, Germany, and other developed markets have seen a shift in consumer payment trends since the late 1990s, with more customers now opting for electronic forms of payment (e.g., credit cards and debit cards) for their in-store purchases over traditional paper-based forms of payment (e.g., cash and checks). Additionally, some merchants offer free cash back at the point-of-sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) for customers that utilize debit cards for their purchases, thus providing an additional incentive for consumers to use these cards. Increasingly, frictionless payment options, like contactless, are also being used by consumers. According to the Nilson Report issued in December 2018, the percentage of cash transaction counts in the U.S. declined from approximately 31.9% of all payment transactions in 2012 to approximately 25.9% in 2017, with declines also seen in check usage as credit and debit card transactions increased. However, in terms of absolute dollar value, the volume of cash used in payment transactions remained relatively flat at $1.6 trillion from 2012 to 2017. The U.K. has followed a similar trend in absolute terms according to the Access to Cash study in the U.K., with cash making up over a third of all transactions and being the second most common payment method. In Australia, the value of banknotes in circulation increased by 2.5% over 2017, but at a somewhat slower rate than in past years. In their customer payments survey, the Reserve Bank of Australia published that 37% of all payments made in Australia are with cash. According to the 2018 Canadian Payment Methods and Trends study, cash was still the most used payment method at 29.8% of all transactions and while cash has been in decline in recent years, in 2017, the rate of decline showed signs of slowing. On a same-store basis, we have generally seen a single-digit percentage rate of decline in the number of cash withdrawal transactions conducted on our U.K.-based ATMs during the last 12-24 months while we have seen low single-digit rates of growth in our U.S.-based ATMs over the last twelve months, which is partly attributable to increased transactions from our surcharge-free Allpoint network. The continued growth in electronic payment methods, such as mobile phone payments, contactless payments and card only self-service order and payment terminals could result in a reduced need for cash in the marketplace and ultimately, a decline in the usage of ATMs. New payment technology, such as Venmo, Zelle, Square Cash, Facebook Messenger Payments and virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, or other new payment method preferences by consumers could reduce the general population\u2019s need or demand for cash and negatively impact our transaction volumes in the future. The proliferation of payment options and changes in consumer preferences and usage behavior could reduce the need for cash and have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nThe ATM industry is highly competitive and such competition may increase, which may adversely affect our profit margins.\nThe ATM business is and can be expected to remain highly competitive. Our principal direct competition comes from independent ATM companies and financial institutions in all of the countries in which we operate. Our competitors could prevent us from obtaining or maintaining desirable locations for our ATMs, cause us to reduce the revenue generated by transactions at our ATMs, or cause us to pay higher merchant fees, thereby reducing our profits. In addition to our current competitors, new and less traditional competitors may enter the market vertically integrated competitors may offer comprehensive bundled product and service offerings or we may face additional competition associated with the creation, integration, and consolidation of competitors through transactions as well as the introduction of alternative payment mechanisms and emerging payment technologies. Increased competition could result in transaction fee reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. As a result, the failure to effectively adapt our organization, products, and services to the market could significantly reduce our offerings to gain market acceptance, could significantly reduce our revenue, increase our operating costs, or otherwise adversely impact our operations and cash flows.\nRegulatory, legislative or self-regulatory/standard developments regarding privacy and data security matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nWe, along with our partners and customers in the financial services area, are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including, among others, those promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and state cybersecurity, privacy, and breach notification laws, the Australian Privacy Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulations. These laws, rules and regulations address a range of issues including data privacy and cybersecurity, and restrictions or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection, retention or transfer of data.\nSuch government regulation (together with applicable industry standards) may increase the costs of doing business. Federal, state, municipal and foreign governments and agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce laws, policies, regulations, and standards covering user privacy, data security, cybersecurity, technologies such as cookies that are used to collect, store and/or process data, marketing online, the use of data to inform marketing, the taxation of products and services, unfair and deceptive practices, and the collection (including the collection of information), use, processing, transfer, storage and/or disclosure of data associated with unique individual internet users. New regulation or legislative actions regarding data privacy and security could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nThe passage of legislation banning or limiting the fees we receive for transactions conducted on our ATMs would severely impact our revenues and our operations.\nWe rely on transaction-based revenues in each of our markets and any regulatory fee limits that could be imposed on our transactions may have an adverse impact on our revenues and profits. If legislation were to be enacted in the future in any of our markets, and the amount we were able to charge consumers to use our ATMs was reduced, our revenues and related profitability would be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if such limits were set at levels that are below our current or future costs to operate our ATMs, it would have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate under our current business model and adversely impact our revenues and cash flows. Despite the nationwide acceptance of surcharge fees at ATMs in the U.S. since their introduction in 1996, consumer activists have from time to time attempted to impose local bans or limits on surcharge fees. Even in the few instances where these efforts have passed the local governing body (such as with an ordinance adopted by the city of Santa Monica, California), U.S. federal courts have overturned these local laws on federal preemption grounds. Although Section 1044 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains a provision that will limit the application of federal preemption with respect to state laws that do not discriminate against national banks, federal preemption will not be affected by local municipal laws, where such proposed bans or limits often arise. Additionally, some U.S. federal officials have expressed concern in previous years that surcharge fees charged by banks and non-bank ATM operators are unfair to consumers.\nInterchange fees, which comprise a substantial portion of our transaction revenues, may be lowered in some cases at the discretion of the various EFT networks through which our transactions are routed, or through potential regulatory changes, thus reducing our future revenues and operating profits.\nInterchange fees, which represented 27.8% of our total ATM operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, are set by the various EFT networks and major interbank networks through which the transactions conducted on our ATMs are routed. These fees vary from one network to the next. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 16.6%, 10.8%, and 0.4% of our total ATM operating revenues were derived from interchange fees in Europe & Africa, North America, and Australia & New Zealand, respectively. Some of these fees are subject to pricing changes that we may be unable to offset through lower payments to merchants. Interchange revenues in the U.K. accounted for 14.7% of our consolidated ATM operating revenues. In the U.K., the\nsignificant majority of the interchange revenues we earn are based on rates set by LINK, the major interbank network in that market.\nRevenues from our UK based ATMs are highly dependent on interchange and therefore susceptible to changes in interchange rates, with the majority of our UK interchange revenues being determined by the rates set by the LINK scheme. In addition to LINK transactions, a small number of UK financial institutions have issued cards that are not affiliated with the LINK network, but instead route over a Visa or MasterCard network. Transactions conducted on our ATMs from these cards currently represent less than 3% of our annual withdrawal transactions in the U.K. The interchange rates set by Visa and MasterCard have historically been less than the LINK rates. Accordingly, if any major financial institution in the U.K. decided to leave the LINK network in favor of Visa, MasterCard, or another network, and we elected to continue to accept the transactions of their cardholders, such a move could impact the interchange revenues that we currently receive from the related withdrawal transactions conducted on our ATMs by these cardholders in that market. During 2017, some of the major financial institutions that provide the majority of LINK volumes expressed concern about the LINK interchange rate and commenced efforts to significantly lower the interchange rate. As a result, a group of members of LINK (the \u201cWorking Group\u201d) developed a new interchange rate setting mechanism and in October 2017, it was decided that an independent \u201cLINK Board\u201d would set interchange rates going forward. On January 31, 2018 the LINK Board issued an update and determined that interchange rates would decrease by 5% from 2017 levels, effective July 1, 2018 and announced the intention to further reduce the interchange rate by three further annual 5% reductions. However, on July 16, 2018, LINK announced that the third interchange rate decrease was canceled and the fourth rate decrease was suspended, pending further review. The first 5% rate reduction occurred on July 1, 2018, and the second scheduled 5% decrease in the LINK interchange rate occurred January 1, 2019. Should there be a significant change in the LINK scheme or its membership, our U.K. interchange revenues and profits could be further adversely impacted.\nIn past years, certain networks have reduced the net interchange rates paid to ATM deployers for ATM transactions in the U.S. routed across their debit networks through a combination of reducing the transaction rates charged to financial institutions and higher per-transaction fees charged by the networks to ATM operators. Accordingly, if some of the networks through which our ATM transactions are routed were to reduce the interchange rates paid to us or increase their transaction fees charged to us for routing transactions across their network, our future transaction revenues could decline. For example, Visa announced a new acquirer fee for non-monetary transactions in the U.S. that took effect on April 1, 2019. In addition to the impact of net interchange rate decreases, we have seen certain financial institutions migrate their volume away from some networks to take advantage of the lower pricing offered by other networks, resulting in lower net interchange rates per transaction to us. In Canada, the vast majority of transactions route through the Interac network which sets the interchange revenue rates for its network.\nIn Canada, domestic transactions represent more than 90% of total transaction volume and these route through the Interac network, which sets the interchange revenue rates for the transactions, with the remaining, non-domestic transactions routing primarily to Visa and Mastercard. As a result, if Interac were to reduce the interchange revenue rates or increase their transaction fees for routing transactions across their network, our future transaction revenues could decline.\nFuture changes in interchange rates, some of which we have minimal or no control over, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in a changing and unpredictable regulatory environment, which may harm our business. If we are subject to new regulations or legislation regarding the operation of our ATMs, we could be required to make substantial expenditures to comply with that regulation or legislation, which may reduce our net income and our profit margins.\nWith its initial roots in the banking industry, the U.S. ATM industry is regulated by the rules and regulations of the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act, which establishes the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in EFT systems. The vast majority of states have few, if any, licensing requirements. However, legislation related to the U.S. ATM industry is periodically proposed at the state and local level. In past years, certain members of the U.S. Congress called for a re-examination of fees that are charged for an ATM transaction, although no legislation was passed relative to these matters. As a part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created, and it is possible that this governmental agency could enact new or modify existing regulations that could have a direct or indirect impact on our business. For additional information related to this topic, see the risk factor entitled The passage of legislation banning or limiting the fees we receive for transactions conducted on our ATMs would severely impact our revenues and our operations below.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), through implementing regulations, requires that public accommodations be accessible to and independently usable by individuals with disabilities, including visually-impaired or wheel-chair bound persons. The U.S. Department of Justice issued accessibility regulations under the ADA that became effective in March 2012, which provided specific requirements for ATMs. Failure to meet these requirements, and other similar requirements under various states\u2019 laws, could adversely impact our operations and revenues, including through costs incurred in lawsuits and payment of damages,\nfines or penalties. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the National Federation of the Blind (the \u201cNFB\u201d) had pursued a lawsuit against the Company alleging non-compliance with the ADA, its implementing regulations, and court orders. We settled this lawsuit by, among other things, agreeing to certain procedures and standards for voice guidance on ATMs. While we have completed implementation of the operational elements of our settlement agreement, any failure to meet the remaining reporting requirements of our settlement agreement in this matter could adversely impact our operations and revenues, including through the incurrence of damages.\nIn the U.K., the ATM industry historically has been largely self-regulating. Most ATMs in the U.K. are part of the LINK network and must operate under the network rules set forth by LINK, which operates under the oversight of the Bank of England and its regulatory capacity and since October 2013, the Payment Systems Regulator (\u201cPSR\u201d) oversees any payment system operating in the U.K. and its participants. The PSR is actively engaged in a review of the LINK scheme and the scheme\u2019s direct commissioning and interchange operating procedures. See the risk factor entitled Interchange fees, which comprise a substantial portion of our transaction revenues, may be lowered in some cases at the discretion of the various EFT networks through which our transactions are routed, or through potential regulatory changes, thus reducing our future revenues above.\nThe amended 2009 Cross Border Payments Regulation requires enhanced consumer disclosure at point of transaction for dynamic currency conversion transactions. The new regulation, which is expected to be introduced over 2020 and 2021 could cause us to suffer losses or other adverse changes in our business that would reduce our net income.\nWe are also subject to various regulations in other jurisdictions that we operate in, including Germany, Spain, Ireland, Mexico, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Due to the numerous regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, there are risks and substantial costs incurred in ensuring consistent compliance with the existing regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions. To the extent we are not successful in complying with the new or existing regulations, non-compliance may have an impact on our ability to continue operating in such jurisdictions or adversely impact our profits. New legislation proposed in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or adverse changes in the laws that we are subject to, may materially affect our business through the requirement of additional expenditures to comply with that legislation or other direct or indirect impacts on our business. If regulatory legislation is passed in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we could be required to incur substantial expenditures or suffer adverse changes in our business that would reduce our net income. In addition, new product and service offerings such as mobile ATM access and deposit-taking ATMs are often subject to additional regulations which may have an impact on our ability to offer such products. We may not be able to comply with all such regulations for new product and services offerings or may not be able to do so profitability.\nInternal control failures, security breaches, including the occurrence of a cyber-incident or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, could harm our business by compromising Company, merchant or vendor data or cardholder information and disrupting our transaction processing services, thus damaging our relationships with our merchant customers, business partners, and generally exposing us to liability.\nAs part of our transaction processing services, we electronically process and transmit cardholder information. We and our vendors have been, and will continue to be, subjected to cyber-attacks or internal control failures, including accidental or intentional computer or network issues (such as unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, phishing attacks, viruses, malware or ransomware installation, server malfunction, software or hardware failures, impairment of data integrity, loss of data or other computer assets, adware, or other similar issues), none of which to date have resulted in any material disruption, interruption, or loss. Our vulnerability to attack and our vendors\u2019 vulnerability to attack exists in relation to known threats, against which we work to implement and maintain what we consider to be adequate security controls, as well as other threats, against which we cannot defend because they are unknown. Consequently, the security measures we deploy and our internal processes and procedures are not perfect or impenetrable, and, despite our investment in and maintenance of security controls, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent all unauthorized access attempts made on our systems.\nA vulnerability in the cybersecurity of our systems or one or more of our vendors\u2019 systems (which include, among other things, cloud based networks and services outside of the control of the Company) could impair, compromise or shut down one or more of our computing systems, transaction processing systems, or our IT network and infrastructure, which could harm our business or result in harm to our customers or our business partners and result in negative publicity or media coverage. Furthermore, companies that process and transmit cardholder information have been specifically and increasingly targeted in recent years by sophisticated and persistent actors including hacktivists, organized criminal groups, and nation states in an effort to obtain information and utilize it for fraudulent transactions or other purposes. It is also possible that a cyber-attack or information security breach could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. We expect that any investigation of a cyber-attack would be inherently unpredictable and that it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information. During such time we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to\nremediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber-attack.\nThe technical and procedural controls we, our vendors and our other partners use to provide security for storage, processing and transmission of confidential customer and other information may not be effective to protect against control failures, data security breaches or other cyber incidents. The risk of unauthorized circumvention of our security measures has been heightened by advances in computer capabilities and the increasing sophistication of hackers. Unauthorized access to our computer systems, or those of our third-party service providers, could result in the theft or publication of the information or the deletion or modification of sensitive records, and could cause interruptions in our operations. Any inability to prevent security breaches could damage our relationships with our merchant and financial institution customers, cause a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders, expose us to liability including claims from merchants, financial institutions, and cardholders, and subject us to network fines.\nFurther, we could be forced to expend significant resources in response to a security breach, including repairing system damage and increasing cybersecurity protection costs by deploying additional personnel, each of which could divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations. These claims also could result in protracted and costly litigation. If unsuccessful in defending that litigation, we might be forced to pay damages and/or change our business practices.\nWhile many of our agreements with partners and third-party vendors contain indemnification provisions and we maintain insurance intended to cover some of these risks, such measures may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.\nWe have a history of making acquisitions and investments, which expose us to additional risk associated with the integration of new information systems, processes, and procedures. We may not adequately identify weaknesses in an acquired entity\u2019s information systems either before or after an acquisition, which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition, expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyber-attack. We may also not be able to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire in a timely manner which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place.\nAs a global company, the cross border movement of data increases our exposure to cybersecurity threats. This cross border data movement must be managed in accordance with an ever changing compliance landscape and the development of cybersecurity guidance and best practice and while we have and will continue to invest in the protection of our systems and the maintenance of what we believe to be adequate security controls over individually identifiable customer, employee and vendor data provided to us, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving our information systems in the future. In addition, we could be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection across the various jurisdictions in which we operate which may overlap and potentially conflict with one another. An actual security breach or cyber-incident could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows and costs to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber-attack could be significantly over and above any obligations arising from any penalties imposed by any regulatory or supervisory authority including in connection with General Data Protection Regulations.\nThe broad introduction of free-to-use ATMs in Australia has and may continue to adversely impact our revenues and profits.\nIn September 2017, Australia\u2019s four largest banks, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (\u201cCBA\u201d), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (\u201cANZ\u201d), Westpac Banking Corporation (\u201cWestpac\u201d), and National Australia Bank Limited (\u201cNAB\u201d), each independently announced decisions to remove all direct charges applied to domestic transactions completed at their respective ATM networks effectively creating a free-to-use network of ATM terminals that did not exist previously.\nAustralia has historically been a direct charge market where cardholders pay a fee (the \u201cdirect charge\u201d) to ATM operators for each transaction, unless the ATM where the transaction is completed is part of the cardholder\u2019s issuing bank ATM network. There continues to be no broad interchange arrangement in Australia between card issuers and ATM operators to compensate ATM operators for the cost of providing a service to cardholders in the absence of a direct charge levied on the cardholder directly. In 2019, approximately 78% of our revenues in Australia were sourced from direct charge fees paid by cardholders. As a result, this introduction of free-to-use ATMs in Australia has and may continue to adversely impact our revenues and profits.\nIn September 2017, we determined that these developments were to be an indicator of impairment of our Australia & New Zealand reporting unit and related long-lived assets. As further discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting - (l) Goodwill, we recorded an impairment of certain assets in our Australia & New Zealand reporting unit in September 2017.\nWhile the direct impact we have experienced has been limited to date, the ultimate impact of this action could increase over time as consumers\u2019 behavior patterns change as a result of the introduction of a free-to-use network in Australia that did not previously exist.\nComputer viruses or unauthorized software (malware) could harm our business by disrupting or disabling our systems, including transaction processing services, causing non-compliance with network rules, damaging our relationships with our merchant and financial institution customers, and damaging our reputation causing a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders.\nWe routinely face cyber and data security threats through computer viruses, malware, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems (\u201cSystem Threats\u201d). Any one or more System Threats could result in the infiltration of our systems, as well as those of our customers and partners, and disrupt our delivery of services, cause delays or loss of data or public releases of confidential data or make our applications unavailable, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our operations and cash flows. Although we utilize several preventative and detective security controls in our network, we have from time to time experienced System Threats to our data and systems, including but not limited to computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents, none of which to date have resulted in any material disruption, interruption or loss. Our preventative and detective security controls at times have been, and may be at times in the future, ineffective in preventing System Threats, and material consequences arising from the occurrence of any such event could damage our relationships with our customers, cause a decrease in transactions by individual cardholders, cause our reputation to be damaged, require us to make significant expenditures to repair or replace equipment, or cause our non-compliance with applicable network rules and regulations.\nCurrency design changes may require modifications to our ATMs that could impact our cash flows.\nIn American Council of the Blind, et. al., v. Timothy F. Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury (Case #1:02-cv-00864) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the \u201cCourt\u201d) an order was entered that found that U.S. currencies (as currently designed) violated the Rehabilitation Act, a law that prohibits discrimination in government programs on the basis of disability, as the paper currencies issued by the U.S. are identical in size and color, regardless of denomination. As a consequence of this ruling, the U.S. Treasury stated in its semi-annual status report filed with the Court in September 2012, that the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (\u201cBEP\u201d) was making progress towards implementing the Secretary\u2019s decision to provide meaningful access to paper currency by: \u201c(i) adding a raised tactile feature (\"RTF\") to each Federal Reserve note that the BEP may lawfully redesign, (ii) continuing the BEP\u2019s program of adding large high-contrast numerals and different colors to each denomination that it may lawfully redesign, and (iii) implementing a supplemental currency reader distribution program for blind and other visually impaired U.S. citizens and legal residents.\u201d Of these three steps only the first materially affects the ATM industry. The BEP continues to research the RTF and is engaged in testing samples in conjunction with the Banknote Equipment Manufactures program. Until a selection is made and disclosed by the BEP, the impact, if any, a raised tactile feature will have on the ATM industry, remains unknown. It is possible that such a change or any redesign of currencies could require us to incur additional costs, which could be substantial, to modify our ATMs in order to store and dispense notes with raised or other tactile features.\nAdditionally, polymer notes have been introduced by a number of countries, including Canada, the U.K. and Australia. Polymer notes were first introduced by the Bank of England in 2016 and are now used, almost exclusively, in our ATMs in the U.K. The introduction of these new currency designs has required upgrades to software and physical ATM components on our ATMs, specifically, software and hardware modifications were completed for the polymer \u00a310s and some minor additional hardware modifications to ATM components are required for polymer \u00a320s. To date, we have not experienced any material adverse financial or operational impact as a result of the new requirements to handle these new notes.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (or \u201cRBA\u201d) has also issued redesigned banknotes beginning with the $5, $10 and $50 Australian dollar banknotes that are currently in circulation . Over 90% of the required polymer upgrades in Australia have been completed and the remaining upgrades are being managed on a case-by-case basis as part of contract extensions or renewals. We expect that the RBA will continue issuing redesigned banknotes to introduce additional security features in subsequent years. The RBA has been progressively releasing new polymer banknotes with a new design and anti-counterfeit security features. The majority of denominations have been released with only the $100 denomination remaining, which is expected to be issued in late 2020. The redesigned banknotes include a raised tactile feature to help the blind and visually impaired community distinguish between different denominations of banknotes and a top-to-bottom clear window in which the banknote is transparent. Any required upgrades or full replacement of our ATMs could require us to incur additional cost which could be substantial and result in ATM downtime which could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nRisks associated with our business.\nWe depend on ATM and financial services transaction fees for substantially all of our revenues, and our revenues would, and profits could, be reduced by a decline in the usage of our ATMs or a decline in the number of ATMs that we operate, whether as a result of changes in consumer spending preferences, global economic conditions or otherwise.\nTransaction fees charged to cardholders and their financial institutions for transactions processed on our ATMs and multi-function financial services kiosks, including surcharge and interchange transaction fees, have historically accounted for most of our revenues. We expect that transaction fees, including fees we receive through our bank-branding and surcharge-free network offerings, will continue to account for the substantial majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Consequently, our future operating results will depend on many factors, including: (i) the market acceptance of our services in our target markets, (ii) the level of transaction fees we receive, (iii) our ability to install, acquire, operate, and retain ATMs, (iv) usage of our ATMs by cardholders and any changes in payment preferences they may have, and (v) our ability to continue to expand our surcharge-free and other automated consumer financial services offerings. If alternative technologies to our services are successfully developed and implemented or there is a significant shift in consumer preferences for other alternative payment methods, we may experience a decline in the usage of our ATMs. Surcharge rates, which are largely market-driven and are often negotiated between us and our merchant partners, could be reduced over time. Further, growth in surcharge-free ATM networks and widespread consumer bias toward these networks could adversely affect our revenues, even though we maintain our own surcharge-free offerings. Many of our ATMs are utilized by consumers that frequent the retail establishments in which our ATMs are located, including convenience stores, gas stations, malls, grocery stores, drug stores, airports, train stations, and other large retailers. If there is a significant slowdown in consumer spending or a change in consumer payment preferences, the number of consumers that frequent the retail establishments in which we operate our ATMs may decline and the number of transactions conducted on those ATMs and our network, and the corresponding transaction fees we earn, may also decline. Additionally, should banks increase the fees they charge to their customers when using an ATM outside of their network (i.e. out of network or foreign bank fees), this would effectively make transactions at our ATM more expensive to consumers and could adversely impact our transaction volumes and revenues.\nShould banks or other ATM operators decrease or eliminate the fees they charge to users of their ATMs in any of our markets (as they did in Australia in 2017) or otherwise offer free access to their networks, such action would make transactions at our ATM comparatively more expensive to consumers and could adversely impact our transaction volumes and revenues. A decline in usage of our ATMs by cardholders, in the levels of fees received by us in connection with this usage, or in the number of ATMs that we operate, would have a negative impact on our revenues and cash flows and would limit our future growth potential.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from ATMs placed with a small number of merchants. The expiration, termination or renegotiation of any of these contracts with our top merchants, or if one or more of our top merchants were to cease doing business with us, or substantially reduce its dealings with us, could cause our revenues to decline significantly and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our contracts with our top five merchant customers (Co-op Food (in the U.K.), Couche Tard, CVS, Speedway, and Walgreens) accounted for approximately 22% of our total revenues, the largest of which accounted for approximately 6% of our total revenues. Because a significant percentage of our future revenues and operating income depends upon the successful continuation of our relationship with our top merchant customers, the loss of any of our largest merchants, such as the loss of 7-Eleven in 2017, a decision by any one of them to reduce the number of our ATMs placed in their locations, or a decision to sell or close their locations could result in a decline in our revenues or otherwise adversely impact our business operations. To the extent there is consolidation or contraction within our primary retailer partners, and as a part of that consolidation or contraction, the retailers decide to reduce their store footprint, such an event could materially impact our revenues and profits. Furthermore, if their financial conditions were to deteriorate in the future, and as a result, one or more of these merchants was required to close a significant number of their store locations, our revenues would be significantly impacted. Additionally, these merchants may elect not to renew their contracts when they expire. As of December 31, 2019, the contracts we have with our five largest merchant customers had a weighted average remaining life of approximately 3.5 years.\nEven if our major contracts are extended or renewed, the renewal terms may be less favorable to us than the current contracts. If any of our largest merchants enters bankruptcy proceedings and rejects its contract with us, fails to renew its contract upon expiration, or if the renewal terms with any of them are less favorable to us than under our current contracts, it could result in a decline in our revenues and profits and have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nDeterioration in global credit markets, as well as changes in legislative and regulatory requirements, could have a negative impact on financial institutions including those with whom we conduct business and may seek to conduct business.\nWe have a significant number of customer and vendor relationships with financial institutions in all of our key markets, including relationships in which those financial institutions pay us for the right to place their brands on our ATMs. Additionally, we rely on a small number of financial institution partners to provide us with the cash that we maintain in our Company-owned ATMs and some of our merchant-owned ATMs. Further, we rely on a small number of financial institution partners to provide us with liquidity under our revolving credit facility. Volatility in the global credit markets may have a negative impact on those financial institutions and our relationships with them. In particular, if the liquidity positions of the financial institutions with which we conduct business deteriorate significantly, these institutions may be unable to perform under their existing agreements with us. If these defaults were to occur, we may not be successful in our efforts to identify new bank-branding partners, vault cash providers or lenders, and the underlying economics of any new arrangements may not be consistent with our current arrangements. Furthermore, if our existing bank-branding partners or vault cash providers are acquired by other institutions with assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), or placed into receivership by the FDIC, it is possible that our agreements may be rejected in part or in their entirety.\nWe rely on third-parties in the various regions where we operate to provide us with the cash we require to operate many of our ATMs. If these third-parties were unable or unwilling to provide us with the necessary cash to operate our ATMs, we would need to identify alternative sources of cash to operate our ATMs or we would not be able to operate our business.\nWe primarily rely on several financial institutions in the regions where we operate to provide us with the vault cash that we use in our ATMs where cash is not provided by the merchant, which includes, approximately 41,000 in North America, approximately 19,000 in Europe and Africa, and approximately 4,000 ATMs in Australia and New Zealand. For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we had an average outstanding vault cash balance of approximately $1.9 billion held in our North America ATMs, approximately $1.1 billion in our ATMs in Europe and Africa and approximately $0.2 billion in our ATMs in Australia and New Zealand.\nOur existing vault cash rental agreements expire at various times through June 2023. However, each provider has the right to demand the return of all or any portion of its cash at any time upon the occurrence of certain events. Other key terms of our agreements include the requirement that the vault cash providers provide written notice of their intent not to renew. Such notice provisions typically require a minimum of 180 to 360 days\u2019 notice prior to the actual termination date. If such notice is not received, then the contracts will typically automatically renew for an additional one-year period.\nIf our vault cash providers were to demand return of their cash or terminate their arrangements with us and remove their cash from our ATMs, or if they fail to provide us with cash as and when we need it for our operations, our ability to operate our ATMs would be jeopardized, and we would need to locate alternative sources of vault cash or potentially suffer significant downtime of our ATMs. In the event this was to happen, the terms and conditions of the new or renewed agreements could potentially be less favorable to us, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, restrictions on access to cash to fill our ATMs could severely restrict our ability to keep our ATMs operating, and could subject us to performance penalties under our contracts with our customers. A significant reduction in access to the necessary cash to operate our ATMs could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on third-party EFT network providers, transaction processors, bank sponsors, armored courier providers, and maintenance providers to provide services to our ATMs. If some of these providers that service a significant number of our ATMs fail or otherwise cease, consolidate, or no longer agree to provide their services, we could suffer a temporary loss of transaction revenues, incur significant costs or suffer the permanent loss of any contract with a merchant or financial institution affected by such disruption in service.\nWe rely on EFT network providers and have agreements with various transaction processors, armored courier providers, and maintenance providers. These service providers enable us to provide card authorization, data capture, settlement, cash management and delivery, and maintenance services to our ATMs. Typically, these agreements are for periods of two or three years each. If we are unable to secure the renewal or replacement of any expiring vendor contracts, or a key vendor fails or otherwise ceases to provide the services for which we have contracted and disruption of service to our ATMs occurs, our relationship with those merchants and financial institutions affected by the disrupted ATM service could suffer.\nWhile we have more than one provider for each of the critical services that we rely on third-parties to perform, certain of these providers currently provide services to or for a significant number of our ATMs. Although we believe we would be able to transition these services to alternative service providers, this could be a time-consuming and costly process. In the event one or more of such service providers was unable to deliver services to us, we could suffer a significant disruption in our business, which\ncould result in a material adverse impact to our financial results. Furthermore, any disruptions in service in any of our markets, whether caused by us or by third-party providers, may continue to result in a loss of revenues under certain of our contractual arrangements that contain minimum service-level requirements and could result in a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nOur operational failures or those of our transaction processors, EFT networks or other service providers could delay or interrupt our products and services and harm our business and our relationships with our merchant and financial institution customers.\nOur ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our EFT transaction processing platforms, third-party transaction processors, telecommunications network systems, and other service providers as well as availability of hardware and replacement parts from vendors. Accordingly, any damage, destruction, or third-party actions that interrupt our services would severely harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of revenues and profits and could cause us to incur substantial additional expenses. Additionally, if any interruption is caused by us, especially in those situations in which we serve as the primary transaction processor, such interruption could result in the loss of the affected merchants and financial institutions, or damage our relationships with them. Prolonged interruption of our services or network that extends for more than several hours (i.e., where our backup systems are not able to recover) would result in data loss and/or a reduction in revenues as our ATMs would be unable to process transactions. Our systems and operations and those of our transaction processors and our EFT network and other service providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire, floods, natural disaster, unlawful acts, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry, cyber-attack, public health emergencies and computer viruses, among other things. We cannot be certain that any measures we and our service providers have taken to prevent system failures will be successful or that we will not experience service interruptions. Should a significant system failure occur, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows. In addition, a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our present and potential merchant and financial institution customers to choose alternative service providers, as well as subject us to fines or penalties related to contractual service agreements and ultimately cause a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain a significant amount of vault cash within our Company-owned ATMs, which is subject to potential loss due to theft or other events, including natural disasters.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2019, our average outstanding vault cash balance was $3.2 billion in our ATMs. Any loss of vault cash from our ATMs is generally our responsibility. We typically require that our service providers, who either transport the vault cash or otherwise have access to the ATM safe, maintain adequate insurance coverage in the event cash losses occur as a result of theft, misconduct, or negligence on the part of such providers. Cash losses at the ATM occur in a variety of ways, such as natural disasters (hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes, etc.), fires, vandalism, and physical removal of the entire ATM, defeating the interior safe or by compromising the ATM\u2019s technology components. Because our ATMs are often installed at retail sites, they face exposure to attempts of theft and vandalism. Thefts of vault cash may be the result of an individual acting alone or as a part of a crime group. We have experienced theft of vault cash from our ATMs across the geographic regions in which we operate and have at times temporarily removed ATMs from service to enhance security features or permanently removed ATMs due to security concerns. While we maintain insurance policies to cover significant losses that may occur that are not covered by the insurance policies maintained by our service providers, such insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions, and limitations that may leave us bearing some or all of those losses. Significant vault cash losses could result in a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nAny increase in the frequency and/or amounts of theft and other losses could negatively impact our operating results by causing higher deductible payments and increased insurance premiums. Certain ATM types have recently been susceptible to coordinated ATM attacks that generally involves a logical or physical compromise of the ATM, which causes the ATM to dispense cash without proper authorization and can be controlled remotely in certain types of these attacks. While we maintain a controls program across many fronts to prevent and quickly detect unauthorized ATM access and theft attempts, there can be no assurance that a significant or successful jackpotting attack attempt could occur on our portfolio. Additionally, in recent periods, we have seen elevated attack attempts and vault cash losses in our U.K. business, in particular. Should these losses continue at an elevated or increasing rate, it could adversely impact our results and impact our ability to obtain insurance for the vault cash used on our ATMs. Also, damage sustained to our merchant customers\u2019 store locations in connection with any ATM-related thefts, if extensive and frequent enough in nature, could negatively impact our relationships with those merchants and impair our ability to deploy ATMs in those existing or new locations of those merchants. Certain merchants have requested, and could request in the future, that we remove ATMs from store locations that have suffered damage as a result of ATM-related thefts, thus negatively impacting our financial results. Finally, we have in the past, and may in the future, voluntarily remove vault cash from certain ATMs on a temporary or permanent basis to mitigate further losses arising from theft or vandalism. Depending on the magnitude and duration of any cash removal, our revenues and profits could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur armored transport business exposes us to additional risks beyond those currently experienced by us in the ownership and operation of ATMs.\nOur armored courier operation in the U.K. delivers cash to and collects residual cash from our ATMs in that market. As of December 31, 2019, we were providing armored courier services to a majority of our ATMs in that market and we currently intend to further expand that operation to service additional ATMs. The armored transport business exposes us to significant risks, including the potential for cash-in-transit losses, employee theft, as well as claims for personal injury, wrongful death, worker\u2019s compensation, punitive damages, and general liability. There can be no assurance that we will avoid significant future claims or adverse publicity related thereto. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover potential liabilities or that insurance coverage will remain available at costs that are acceptable to us. The availability of quality and reliable insurance coverage is an important factor in our ability to successfully operate this aspect of our operations. A loss claim for which insurance coverage is denied or that is in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful, we could lose customers or have difficulty attracting new customers, which would adversely impact our revenues and our operations.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards. Due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to security features, compatibility between systems and software and hardware components, consumer preferences, industry standards, demands of our financial institution and retail customers, and other factors, we regularly update the technology components, including software, on our ATMs. These technology upgrade efforts, in some cases, may result in downtime to our ATMs, and as a result, loss of transactions and revenues. Additionally, our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers will significantly affect our future success. Our ability to take advantage of opportunities in the market may require us to invest considerable resources adapting our organization and capabilities to support development of products and systems that can support new services or be integrated with new technologies and incur other expenses in advance of our ability to generate revenue from these products and services. These developmental efforts may require substantial capital investment, divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, management time and attention from other matters, and these efforts may not lead to the development of viable new products or services on a timely or cost effective basis. We may not be successful in developing, marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands. In addition, we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of these products and services, or our new products and services and enhancements may not adequately meet the demands of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance.\nMicrosoft announced a plan to end technical support and patches for a series of Windows-based operating systems, including Windows 7, which is currently in use on a large number of our ATMs. Microsoft has stated that support for Windows 7 has ended as of January 2020 and that limited support will be available until 2023 for a fee. As a large number of our ATMs currently operate on Windows 7 we are in the process of upgrading or replacing portions of our fleet. As we progress through the upgrades we anticipate the cost will be significant to us and may elevate our capital expenditures. Changing security features, compatibility requirements and end of life capital replenishment may result in upgrade costs and capital costs as well as downtime at some of our ATMs, which could adversely impact revenues and profits.\nIf we are unsuccessful in offering products or services that gain market acceptance, it could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our operations.\nErrors or omissions in the settlement of merchant funds or in our vault cash reconciliations could damage our relationships with our merchant customers and vault cash providers, respectively and expose us to liability.\nWe are responsible for maintaining accurate bank account information for certain of our merchant, financial institution customers and vault cash providers and accurate settlements of funds into these accounts based on the underlying transaction activity. This process relies on precise and authorized maintenance of electronic records and internal controls. Although we have controls in place to help ensure the safety and accuracy of our records in the movement and settlement of funds, errors or unauthorized changes to these records or failure to maintain proper controls of the vault cash in transit with our carriers could result in the erroneous or fraudulent movement of funds, thus damaging our relationships with our merchant customers and vault cash providers exposing us to liability and potentially resulting in a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows.\nChanges in interest rates could increase our operating costs by increasing interest expense under our credit facilities and our vault cash rental costs.\nInterest on amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility is based on a floating interest rate, and our vault cash rental expense is based primarily on floating interest rates. As a result, our interest expense and cash management costs are sensitive to changes in interest rates. We pay a monthly fee on the average outstanding vault cash balances in our ATMs under floating rate formulas based on a spread above various LIBOR in the U.S., and the U.K. In Germany and Spain, the rate is based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (commonly referred to as \u201cEuribor\u201d). In Mexico, the rate is based on the Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (commonly referred to as the \u201cTIIE\u201d), in Canada, the rate is based on the Bank of Canada\u2019s Bankers Acceptance Rate and the Canadian prime rate, and in Australia, the formula is based on the Bank Bill Swap Rates (\u201cBBSY\u201d). Although we currently hedge a portion of our vault cash interest exposure and interest on outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility by using interest rate swap and cap contracts, we may not be able to enter into similar arrangements for similar amounts in the future. Any significant future increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on our earnings and cash flow by increasing our operating costs and expenses.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a group of large banks, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (or \"ARRC\"), selected the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to publish the Secured Overnight Finance Rate or SOFR as an alternative to LIBOR. Beginning in May 2018, SOFR was established as a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowing collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Furthermore, the Bank of England has commenced publication of a reformed Sterling Overnight Index Average (or \"SONIA\"), comprised of a broader set of overnight Sterling money market transactions. The SONIA has been recommended as the alternative to Sterling LIBOR by the Bank of England\u2019s Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR, SONIA or other rates will become widely accepted alternatives to LIBOR. As a result, it is also not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue in place, what changes will be made to it, what rates may replace LIBOR going forward, or how a reference rate will be determined for purposes of loans, securities and derivative instruments that reference LIBOR when and if it ceases to exist. For these reasons, the potential effect of a LIBOR phase out on our operating costs cannot yet be determined. In addition, any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in an increase or decrease in reported LIBOR. The potential changes could have a negative impact on our earnings and cash flow by increasing our operating costs and expenses.\nFor additional information, see Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.\nThe election by our merchant customers not to participate in our surcharge-free network offerings could impact the effectiveness of our offerings, which would negatively impact our financial results.\nFinancial institutions that are members of the Allpoint network pay a fee in exchange for allowing their cardholders to use selected Company-owned, managed and/or participating ATMs on a surcharge-free basis. The success of the Allpoint network is dependent upon the participation by our merchant customers in that network. In the event a significant number of our merchants elect not to participate in that network, the benefits and effectiveness of the network would be diminished, thus potentially causing some of the participating financial institutions to not renew their agreements, terminate early with us, and/or trigger financial penalties, thereby having a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe may be unable to effectively integrate our acquisitions, which could increase our cost of operations, reduce our profitability, or reduce our shareholder value.\nWe have been an active business acquirer and may be active in the future. The acquisition and integration of businesses involves a number of risks. The core risks are in the areas of valuation (negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence) and integration (managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company\u2019s personnel, products, processes, technology, and other assets so as to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition).\nThe process of integrating operations is time consuming and could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations, any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions, and the integration of the companies\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. The difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating\npersonnel with disparate business backgrounds, and combining different corporate cultures. Further, if we cannot successfully integrate an acquired company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our consolidated financial statements may be impaired and we may not be able to meet our reporting obligations under applicable law. Any such impairment or failure could cause investor confidence and, in turn, the market price of our common shares, to be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, even if we are able to integrate acquired businesses successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the cost efficiency or synergies, or other benefits that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates or these benefits may not be achieved within a reasonable period of time. We may be required to invest significant capital and resources after an acquisition to maintain or grow the business that we acquire. Further, acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings, or cash flows. Any shortfall in anticipated revenues, earnings, or cash flows could require us to write down the carrying value of the intangible assets associated with any acquired company, which would adversely affect our reported earnings.\nSince we were incorporated as Cardtronics Group, Inc. in 2001, we have acquired numerous ATM businesses, a surcharge-free ATM network, a technology product offering that complements our surcharge-free offering, an ATM installation company in the U.K., a Scotland-based provider and developer of marketing and advertising software and services for ATM owners, a U.K.-based provider of secure cash logistics and ATM maintenance, and a transaction processor in the U.S. We have made acquisitions to obtain the assets of deployed ATM networks and the related businesses and their infrastructure, as well as for strategic reasons to enhance the capability of our ATMs and expand our service offerings. We currently anticipate that our future acquisitions, if any, will likely reflect a mix of asset acquisitions and acquisitions of businesses, with each acquisition having its own set of unique characteristics. In the future, we may acquire businesses outside of our traditional areas, which could introduce new risks and uncertainties. To the extent that we elect to acquire an existing company or the operations, technology, and the personnel of the company, we may assume some or all of the liabilities associated with the acquired company and face new and added challenges integrating such acquisition into our operations.\nA failure of enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) and other associated information systems changes could adversely impact our business and our results of operations.\nThe Company has implemented a new cloud based enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage the business. This implementation required the commitment of significant personnel and financial resources, and entailed risks to business operations. Failure and difficulties encountered with our new ERP and related information systems would result in lost anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and/or interruptions in service or other operational difficulties that hinder our ability to effectively manage our business. If we do experience unanticipated failures or other difficulties with the ERP system, we may incur additional costs associated with repairing and/or re-implementing the system, adversely impacting our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in many sovereign jurisdictions across the globe and expect to continue to grow our business in new regions. Operating in different countries involves special risks which could result in a reduction of our gross and net profits.\nWe have operations in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Spain, Ireland, Mexico, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and South Africa. We expect to continue to expand in the countries in which we currently operate, and potentially into other countries as opportunities arise. We currently report our consolidated results in U.S. dollars and under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d or \u201cGAAP\u201d) and expect to do so for the foreseeable future. Operating in various distinct jurisdictions presents a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to currency fluctuations, including the risk that our future reported operating results could be negatively impacted by unfavorable movements in the functional currencies of our international operations relative to the U.S. dollar, which represents our consolidated reporting currency;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of exchange controls, which could impair our ability to freely move cash;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in complying with the different laws and regulations in each country and jurisdiction in which we operate, including unique labor and reporting laws and restrictions on the collection, management, aggregation, and use of information;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in laws, regulations, and policies of governments or other regulatory bodies, including changes that could potentially disallow surcharging or that could result in a reduction in the amount of interchange or other transaction-based fees that we receive;\n\u2022\nnew, existing or unanticipated conflicts, and political and/or social instability that may be experienced;\n\u2022\nrising crime rates in certain of the areas we operate in, including increased incidents of crimes on our ATMs and against store personnel where our ATMs are located;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including hiring and retaining skilled workers in those countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\ndecreased ATM usage related to decreased travel and tourism or travel restrictions and quarantines in the markets that we operate in;\n\u2022\ndecreased use or restrictions on the use of cash, or supply chain or staffing interruptions, related to the widespread outbreak of contagious diseases;\n\u2022\nexposure to corruption in jurisdictions where we operate; and\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on the repatriation of foreign earnings.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse impact on us and reduce the revenues and profitability derived from our international operations and thereby adversely impact our consolidated operations and cash flows.\nThe exit of the U.K. from the European Union could adversely affect us and our shareholders.\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. exited the European Union and is now in a transition period through December 2020. As a significant portion of our operations are located in the U.K. and our parent company is incorporated in the U.K., we face potential risks associated with the exit and transition. The exit of the U.K. from the E.U. and implementation of the resulting changes could materially and adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal, human, and regulatory regime as well as the macro-economic environment in which we operate. The effect of any of these risks, were they to materialize, is difficult to quantify, but could materially increase our operating and compliance costs and materially affect our tax position or business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues and profits from bank-branding relationships with financial institutions and surcharge-free revenue from our Allpoint network. A decline in these revenues as a result of changes in financial institution and card provider demand for these services may have a significant negative impact on our results.\nBank-branding and surcharge-free revenues from our Allpoint network drive a significant portion of our revenues, and if these product offerings were to become less attractive to financial institutions and card providers whereby we lost a significant amount of existing contracts, it could have a material impact on our revenues and profits. In addition, consolidations within the banking industry may impact our bank-branding relationships as existing bank-branding customers are acquired by other financial institutions, some of which may not be existing bank-branding customers. Our bank-branding contracts could be adversely affected by such consolidations.\nIf we experience additional impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets, we will be required to record a charge to earnings, which may be significant.\nWe have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and are required to perform periodic assessments for any possible impairment for accounting purposes. We periodically evaluate the recoverability and the amortization period of our intangible assets under U.S. GAAP and have taken impairment charges following this analysis in the past. Some of the factors that we consider important in assessing whether or not impairment exists include the performance of the related assets relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. These factors and assumptions, and any changes in them, could result in an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nDuring 2019, we recognized a $7.3 million impairment of our goodwill in our Canada reporting unit. Additionally, during 2017, we recognized impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets of $140.0 million and $54.5 million, respectively, in our Australia & New Zealand reporting unit. See the risk factor entitled, The broad introduction of free-to-use ATMs in Australia has and will continue to adversely impact our revenues and profits, above for additional information regarding the market changes that resulted in this impairment. As of December 31, 2019, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of $752.6 million and $113.9 million, respectively. In the event we determine our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets are impaired in the future, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements, which would negatively impact our results of operations and that impact could be material.\nWe may accumulate excess or obsolete inventory or assets that cannot be used or re-deployed, which could result in unanticipated write-downs and adversely affect our financial results.\nTo the extent we are not able to re-deploy the assets, we may in future periods incur write-downs of these and other assets which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, and make payments on our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our outstanding indebtedness was $754.8 million, which represents approximately 67% of our total book capitalization of approximately $1.1 billion. Our indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow in the future to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to refinance our indebtedness or, in the case of our Convertible Notes, issue shares;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, and adverse changes in government regulation; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our growth strategy, research and development costs, or other purposes.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows. We cannot assure shareholders that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings, including those under our credit facilities, will be available in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness. If we do not have sufficient earnings or capital resources to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money, delay investment and capital expenditures, or sell equity or debt securities, none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do on commercially reasonable terms or at all. For additional information, see Part II. Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing Facilities.\nOur $287.5 million Convertible Notes are due to mature on December 1, 2020. While our current plan is to retire these obligations with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility and we currently have and expect to have the necessary capacity under our revolving credit facility to repay the Convertible Notes, there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow the necessary funds at the time they mature. Alternatively, if we are unable to secure the necessary funds through our revolving credit facility or another financing vehicle, we may issue new common stock for the settlement of the Convertible Notes which could dilute our current shareholders\u2019 equity interests.\nThe terms of our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions.\nOur credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes include a number of covenants that, among other items, restrict or limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nsell or transfer property or assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or redeem or repurchase shares;\n\u2022\nmerge into or consolidate with any third-party;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume, or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nissue or sell preferred shares of restricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nIn addition, we are required by our credit agreement to adhere to certain covenants and maintain specified financial ratios. As a result of these ratios, we may be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business in the future and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance our future operations or capital needs. Accordingly, these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations. A failure to comply with the covenants or financial ratios could result in an event of default. In the event of a default under our credit agreement, the lenders could exercise a number of remedies, some of which could result in an event of default under the indentures governing the senior notes. An acceleration of indebtedness under our credit agreement would also likely result in an event of default under the terms of any other financing arrangement we have outstanding at the time. If any or all of our debt were to be accelerated, we cannot assure shareholders that our assets would be sufficient to repay our indebtedness in full. If we are unable to repay any amounts\noutstanding under our bank credit facility when due, the lenders will have the right to proceed against the collateral securing our indebtedness. Such actions could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flows. For additional information related to our credit agreement and indentures, see Part II. Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing Facilities.\nThe fundamental change and make-whole fundamental change provisions associated with our $287.5 million of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due December 2020 (\u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nThe fundamental change purchase rights, which will allow holders of our Convertible Notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with certain other circumstances may delay or prevent a takeover of us or the removal of current management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. For the potential dilutive effect on the convertible notes, see the risk factor entitled The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash could have a material affect on our reported financial results.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, if relevant, or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as described in our convertible indentures, and our debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or required purchase of the Convertible Notes.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of our Convertible Notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change purchase consideration specified within the convertible note indentures. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase consideration if holders submit their Convertible Notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash (if any) due if holders surrender their Convertible Notes for conversion. In addition, the occurrence of a fundamental change may cause an event of default under agreements governing us or our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness. Agreements governing any future debt may also restrict our ability to make any of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to purchase the Convertible Notes or to pay cash (if any) due upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. In addition, if we fail to purchase the Convertible Notes or to pay the amount of cash (if any) due upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we will be in default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the Convertible Notes or to pay the amount of cash (if any) due upon conversion. Our convertible notes are due December 2020, see Part I. Item 1A. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, and make payments on our indebtedness.\nNon-compliance with established EFT network rules and regulations could expose us to fines, penalties or other liabilities and could negatively impact our results of operations. Additionally, new EFT network rules and regulations could require us to expend significant amounts of capital to remain in compliance with such rules and regulations.\nOur transactions are routed over various EFT networks to obtain authorization for cash disbursements and to provide account balances. These networks include Star, Pulse, NYCE, Cirrus (MasterCard), and Plus (Visa) in the U.S., and LINK in the U.K., among other networks. We utilize various other EFT networks in our other geographic locations. EFT networks set the interchange fees that they charge to the financial institutions, as well as the amounts paid to us. Additionally, EFT networks, including MasterCard and Visa, establish rules and regulations that ATM providers, including ourselves, must comply with in order for member cardholders to use those ATMs. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations could expose us to penalties and/or fines, which could negatively impact our financial results. Furthermore, compliance may in certain instances require capital expenditure, which could be significant. The payment networks\u2019 rules and regulations are generally subject to change and they may modify their rules and regulations from time to time. Our inability to react to changes in the rules and regulations or the interruption or application thereof, may result in the substantial disruption of our business.\nThe majority of the electronic debit networks over which our transactions are conducted require sponsorship by a bank, and the loss of any of our sponsors and our inability to find a replacement may cause disruptions to our operations.\nIn each of the geographic segments in which we operate, bank sponsorship is required in order to process transactions over certain networks. In all of our markets, our ATMs are connected to financial transaction switching networks operated by organizations such as Visa and MasterCard. The rules governing these switching networks require any company sending transactions through these networks to be a bank or a technical service processor that is approved and monitored by a bank. As a result, the\noperation of our ATM network in all of our markets depends on our ability to secure these \u201csponsor\u201d arrangements with financial institutions. In the U.S., our largest geographic segment by revenues, bank sponsorship is required on a significant majority of our transactions and we rely on our sponsor banks for participation in the applicable networks. In the U.K., only international transactions require bank sponsorship. In Mexico, all ATM transactions require bank sponsorship, which is currently provided by our banking partners in the country. In Canada, Germany, and Spain, bank sponsorships are also required and are obtained through our relationships with third-party processors. If our current sponsor banks decide to no longer provide this service, or are no longer financially capable of providing this service as may be determined by certain networks, it may be difficult to find an adequate replacement at a cost similar to what we incur today, or potentially, we could incur a temporary service disruption for certain transactions in the event we lose or do not retain bank sponsorship, which may negatively impact our profitability and may prevent us from doing business in that market.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, the rapidly changing automated consumer financial services industry, and the geographical segments in which we operate. It is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of several of our senior executives or key managers would have an adverse effect on our operations, if we are not able to find suitable replacements for such persons in a timely manner. Unexpected turnover in key leadership positions within the Company may adversely impact our ability to manage the Company efficiently and effectively, could be disruptive and distracting to management and may lead to additional departures of existing personnel, any of which could adversely impact our business. Any adverse change in our reputation, whether as a result of decreases in revenue or a decline in the market price of our common shares, could affect our ability to motivate and retain our existing employees and recruit new employees. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, manage, motivate and retain other qualified management, as well as technical and operational personnel as we grow. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel in the future, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to business cycles, seasonality, and other outside factors such as extreme weather, natural disasters or health emergencies that may negatively affect our business.\nMany of our ATMs are located in convenience stores, gas stations, malls, grocery stores, drug stores, airports, train stations, and other large retailers and are utilized by consumers that frequent them. As such transaction volumes at our ATMs located in regions affected by strong winter weather patterns typically experience declines in volume during those months as a result of decreases in the amount of consumer traffic through such locations. With the majority of our ATMs located in the northern hemisphere, we expect to see slightly higher transactions in the warmer summer months from May through August, which are also aided by increased vacation and holiday travel. As a result of these seasonal variations, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and could lead to volatility in the price of our shares. In addition, if a recessionary economic environment were to reduce traffic at our ATM locations, this could impact the level of transactions taking place on our networks and at our ATMs.\nNatural or man-made disasters (including, hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes, fires, or acts of war or terror), uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions or real or potential health emergencies such as the widespread outbreak of contagious diseases could hinder travel, result in travel bans, government restrictions or quarantines. Any of these events could restrict or reduce traffic at our ATM locations, reduce the use or demand for cash or decrease demand for our services. In addition, any catastrophic events or significant business interruptions could reduce or impair our ability, and that of our employees, to provide services and conduct operations and this may occur in a manner that cannot be mitigated by our disaster and business continuity planning or cause losses which are not recoverable under our insurance policies. The impact of such events may have a range of lingering impacts on us, our employees, customers, our suppliers and the overall economy, adversely affecting our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows even after the initial incident resolves.\nChanges in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our business.\nWe are a large corporation with operations in various jurisdictions around the world. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision.\nFrom time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. For example, the recent U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in significant changes to the U.S. federal tax code. This tax legislation significantly reduced the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate and made other changes that could have a favorable impact on our overall U.S. federal tax liability in a given period. However, the tax legislation also included a\nnumber of provisions, including, but not limited to, the limitation or elimination of various deductions or credits (including for interest expense and for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m)), the imposition of taxes on certain cross-border payments or transfers and the changing of the timing of the recognition of certain income and deductions or their character that could significantly and adversely affect our U.S. federal income tax position. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may also be audited from time to time and while we generally believe we comply with all filing and reporting requirements, a regulator may challenge a particular position or interpretation of law or practice. Certain of our entities are currently under audit.\nIn addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws (such as the recent U.S. tax legislation), rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in several jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.\nOur business operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from paying or promising to pay government officials, political parties, or political party officials and in some cases private individuals or organizations for the purpose of obtaining, retaining, influencing, or directing business. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental or commercial corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices.\nOur employees and agents may interact with government officials on our behalf, including interactions necessary to obtain licenses and other regulatory approvals necessary to operate our business, import or export equipment and resolve tax disputes. These interactions create a risk that actions may occur that could violate the FCPA or other similar laws.\nAlthough we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations as well as U.S. and U.K. laws and regulations, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, contractors and agents will abide by our policies. If we were to be found to be liable for violations of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or similar anti-corruption laws, either due to our own acts or out of inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered globally by the United Nations and in the United States by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). These programs prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, governments or individuals, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Additionally other countries in which we operate also have sanctions programs including Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and the European Union.\nCompliance with sanctions regulations may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent or contradictory between jurisdictions. Any violation of OFAC or other sanctions regulations could result in criminal or civil penalties which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nMany jurisdictions apply financial crime regulations, including combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Whilst we are not a financial institution, certain of these regulations may apply to our businesses. To the extent that they do, any violation of such financial crime regulations could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may lose a valuable competitive advantage or be forced to incur costly litigation to protect our rights. Additionally, if we face claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property, we may be forced to incur costly litigation.\nOur success depends, in part, on developing and protecting our intellectual property. We rely on copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on other confidentiality and contractual agreements and arrangements with our employees, affiliates, business partners and customers to establish and protect our intellectual property and similar proprietary rights. While we expect these agreements and arrangements to be honored, we cannot assure shareholders that they will be and, despite our efforts, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how could become known to, or independently developed by competitors. Agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy. Effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available. Any litigation relating to the defense of our intellectual property, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and potentially cause a diversion of our resources.\nIn addition, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property rights that are material to our business operations. We may expose ourselves to additional liability if we agree to indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims. If the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are, or a customer which we are obligated to indemnify is, infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or services, and such changes may be expensive or impractical, or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights. In the event a claim of infringement against us is successful, we may be required to pay royalties to use technology or other intellectual property rights that we had been using, or we may be required to enter into a license agreement and pay license fees, or we may be required to stop using the technology or other intellectual property rights that we had been using. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third-parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable amount of time. Any litigation of this type, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and potentially cause a diversion of our resources.\nWe are subject to business cycles, seasonality, and other outside factors that may negatively affect our business.\nOur overall business is subject to seasonal variations. Transaction volumes at our ATMs located in regions affected by strong winter weather patterns typically experience declines in volume during those months as a result of decreases in the amount of consumer traffic through such locations. With the majority of our ATMs located in the northern hemisphere, we expect to see slightly higher transactions in the warmer summer months from May through August, which are also aided by increased vacation and holiday travel. As a result of these seasonal variations, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and could lead to volatility in the price of our shares. In addition, a recessionary economic environment could impact the level of transactions taking place on our networks, which could have a material impact on our operations and cash flows.\nCardtronics plc may be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and could be liable for substantial additional U.S. federal income taxes in the event our redomicile to the U.K. is successfully challenged by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d).\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation is generally considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization. Because Cardtronics plc is incorporated under English law, it should be considered a U.K. tax resident, and not a U.S. tax resident under these general rules. However, Section 7874 of the Code provides that a corporation organized outside the U.S. that acquires substantially all of the assets of a corporation organized in the U.S. (including through a merger) will be treated as a U.S. corporation (and therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if (i) the shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation own at least 80% (of either the voting power or value) of the share of the acquiring foreign corporation after the acquisition and (ii) the acquiring foreign corporation\u2019s \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d does not have substantial business activities in the country in which the acquiring foreign corporation is organized relative to the expanded affiliated group\u2019s worldwide activities (\u201csubstantial business activities\u201d or the \u201cSBA Test\u201d). Pursuant to the Redomicile Transaction, Cardtronics plc indirectly acquired all of Cardtronics Delaware\u2019s assets, and Cardtronics Delaware shareholders held 100% of the value of Cardtronics plc by virtue of their prior share ownership of Cardtronics Delaware immediately after the Redomicile Transaction. As a result, the Cardtronics plc expanded affiliated group (which includes Cardtronics Delaware and its subsidiaries) must have had substantial business activities in the U.K. for Cardtronics plc to avoid being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code. In order for the Cardtronics plc expanded affiliated group to have satisfied the SBA Test, at least 25% of the employees (by headcount and compensation), assets, and gross income of such group must have been based, located, and derived, respectively, in the U.K. as of the dates and for relevant periods under the Code sections.\nCardtronics plc believes it fully satisfied the SBA Test and performed rigorous analysis to support this conclusion. However, the application of Section 7874 of the Code is not entirely clear in all situations, and while we believe the SBA Test was fully\nsatisfied, there is no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree. Furthermore, there have been legislative proposals to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence and there could be changes to the Code (including Section 7874 of the Code) or the U.S. Treasury Regulations that could result in Cardtronics plc being treated as a U.S. corporation or otherwise have adverse consequences. Such statutory or regulatory provisions could have retroactive application.\nIf it were determined that Cardtronics plc should be taxed as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Cardtronics plc could be liable for substantial additional U.S. federal income taxes. Additionally, the U.K. could continue to tax Cardtronics plc as a U.K. tax resident for U.K. tax purposes, and thus Cardtronics plc and its shareholders could be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and the U.K.\nOur U.S. shareholders could suffer tax consequences if we are treated as a \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nA foreign corporation will be treated as a \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d (\u201cCFC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if, on any day during the taxable year of such foreign corporation, more than 50% of the equity interests in such corporation, measured by reference to the combined voting power or value of the equity of the corporation, is owned directly or by application of the attribution and constructive ownership rules of Sections 958(a) and 958(b) of the Internal Revenue Code by United States Shareholders. For this purpose, a \u201cUnited States Shareholder\u201d is any United States person that possesses directly, or by application of the attribution and constructive ownership rules of Sections 958(a) and 958(b) of the Code, 10% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of equity in such corporation. Each United States Shareholder of our Company who owns, directly or indirectly, our common shares on the last day of the taxable year on which we are a CFC will be required to include in its gross income for United States federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of our \u201cSubpart F income,\u201d even if the Subpart F income is not distributed. Subpart F income generally includes passive income but also includes certain related party sales, manufacturing and services income. Additionally, post U.S. Tax Reform, each United States Shareholder of our Company may be required to include in their gross income for United States federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of our Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, even if undistributed. If we are a CFC, the Passive Foreign Investment Company (\"PFIC\") rules set forth above, even if we are otherwise considered to be a PFIC, will not be applicable. United States persons who might, directly, indirectly or constructively, acquire 10% or more of our common shares, and therefore might be a United States Shareholder, should consider the possible application of the CFC rules, and consult a tax advisor with respect to such matter.\nOur operating results have fluctuated historically and could continue to fluctuate in the future, which could affect our ability to maintain our current market position or expand.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in consumers\u2019 preferences for cash as a payment vehicle;\n\u2022\nchanges implemented by networks and how they determine interchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in the ATM and financial services industries;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other companies providing the same or similar services that we offer;\n\u2022\nchanges in the demand for our services by financial institutions;\n\u2022\nchanges in legislative or regulatory requirements associated with the ATM and financial services industries;\n\u2022\nchanges in payment trends and offerings in the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nsecurity or data breaches, cyber-incidents or other business disruptions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial condition and operational execution of our key vendors and service providers;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of our merchant customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing and magnitude of operating expenses, capital expenditures, and expenses related to the expansion of sales, marketing, and operations, including as a result of acquisitions, if any;\n\u2022\npolitical or social instability;\n\u2022\nthe timing and magnitude of any impairment charges that may materialize over time relating to our goodwill, intangible assets, or long-lived assets;\n\u2022\nchanges in the general level of interest rates in the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in inflation or how key vendors and suppliers price their services to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of our current services;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial condition and credit risk of our customers;\n\u2022\nany adverse results in litigation by us or by others against us;\n\u2022\nour inability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness as they become due;\n\u2022\nour failure to successfully enter new markets or the failure of new markets to develop in the time and manner we anticipate;\n\u2022\nacquisitions, strategic alliances, or joint ventures involving us, our customers, vendors, or our competitors;\n\u2022\nterrorist acts, theft, vandalism, fires, floods, or other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndecreased use or restrictions on the use of cash, or supply chain interruptions, related to the widespread outbreak of contagious diseases;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax rates or tax policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nexposure to currency fluctuations, including the risk that our future reported operating results could be negatively impacted by unfavorable movements in the functional currencies of our international operations relative to the U.S. dollar, which represents our consolidated reporting currency.\nAny of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although we have experienced revenue growth in recent years, this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future operating results. A relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to personnel expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and interest expense. Therefore, our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues. Additionally, beginning in July 2017, the loss of our largest customer at that time, 7-Eleven in the U.S., had a significant negative impact on our income from operations and cash flows. As such, comparisons to prior periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance.\nRisks associated with our common shares\nWe may issue additional common shares or instruments convertible into common shares, which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common shares and the trading price of our Convertible Notes.\nWe may conduct future offerings of our common shares or other securities convertible into our common shares to fund acquisitions, finance operations or for general corporate purposes. In addition, we may elect to settle the conversion of our outstanding Convertible Notes in common shares and we may also issue common shares under our equity awards programs. The market price of our common shares or the trading price of the Convertible Notes could decrease significantly if we conduct such future offerings, if any of our existing shareholders sells a substantial amount of our common shares or if the market perceives that such offerings or sales may occur. Moreover, any issuance of additional common shares will dilute the ownership interest of our existing common shareholders and may adversely affect the ability of holders of our Convertible Notes to participate in any appreciation of our common shares.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash could have a material affect on our reported financial results.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, an entity must separately account for the debt component and the embedded conversion option of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion, such as our Convertible Notes, in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of the accounting treatment for such instruments is that the value of such embedded conversion option is treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes, and that original issue discount is amortized into interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes using an effective yield method. As a result, we are required to record non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the effective original issue discount to the Convertible Notes\u2019 face amount over the term of the notes. Accordingly, we report lower net income in our financial results because of the recognition of both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the Convertible Notes\u2019 coupon interest.\nUnder certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash are evaluated for their impact on earnings per share utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the notes are accounted for as if the number of common shares that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes, then our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.\nOur articles of association include mandatory offer provisions that may be viewed as less favorable to shareholders, including with respect to takeover matters.\nAlthough we are not currently subject to the U.K. Takeover Code, certain provisions similar to the mandatory offer provisions and certain other aspects of the U.K. Takeover Code were specifically approved and included in our articles of association that were adopted at the special meeting of shareholders of Cardtronics Delaware held in June 2016 in connection with the Redomicile Transaction. As a result, except as permitted by our articles of association, (including acquisitions with the consent of our Board\nof Directors or with prior approval by the independent shareholders at a general meeting), a shareholder, together with persons acting in concert, would be at risk of certain Board of Directors sanctions if they acquired 30% or more of our issued shares without making a voluntary offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares, not already held by the acquirer, that is in cash (or accompanied by a full cash alternative) and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of the U.K. Takeover Code, (as if the U.K. Takeover Code applied to us). The ability of shareholders to retain their shares upon completion of an offer for our entire issued share capital may depend on whether the Board of Directors subsequently agrees to propose a court-approved scheme of arrangement that would, if approved by our shareholders, compel minority shareholders to transfer or surrender their shares in favor of the offeror, or if the offeror acquires at least 90% of the shares. In that case, the offeror can require minority shareholders to accept the offer under the \u2018squeeze-out\u2019 provisions in our articles of association. The mandatory offer provisions in our articles of association could have the effect of discouraging the acquisition and holding of interests of 30% or more of our issued shares and encouraging those shareholders, who may be acting in concert, with respect to the acquisition of shares, to obtain the recommendation of our Board of Directors before effecting any additional purchases. In addition, these provisions may adversely affect the market price of our shares or inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our shares that could otherwise result from actual or rumored takeover attempts.\nEnglish law generally provides for increased shareholder approval requirements with respect to certain aspects of capital management.\nEnglish law provides that a board of directors may generally only allot shares with the prior authorization of shareholders and such authorization must specify the maximum nominal value of the shares that can be allotted and can be granted for a maximum period of five years, each as specified in the articles of association or the relevant shareholder resolution. English law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash. It is possible, however, for the articles of association, or shareholders in a general meeting, to exclude preemptive rights, if coupled with a general authorization to allot shares. Such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years from the date of adoption of the articles of association, or from the date of the shareholder resolution, as applicable.\nEnglish law also prohibits us from repurchasing our own shares by way of \u201coff market purchases\u201d by ordinary resolution (i.e., majority of votes cast of our shareholders). Such authority can be granted for a maximum period of up to five years but may be sought more frequently. English law prohibits us from conducting \u201con market purchases\u201d as our shares are listed on NASDAQ and will not be traded on a recognized investment exchange in the U.K.\nOur shareholders approved the authorization of off market purchases that will expire in 2024 unless renewed by our shareholders prior to the expiration date. We cannot assure shareholders that situations will not arise where such shareholder approval requirements for any of these actions would deprive our shareholders of substantial capital management benefits.", "PERMNO": 92457, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "CATM"}
