{"cik": "854852", "company": "EMRISE Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following summarizes material risks that investors should carefully consider before deciding to buy or maintain an investment in our common stock. Any of the following risks, if they actually occur, would likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors could lose the money they paid to buy our common stock or not profit from their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nDuring 2014 we examined the strategies available to the Company. The Board recognized that our products were well regarded in the global market-place but further investment was required to exploit the opportunities. Although we generated net income in 2014 our profits remain inconsistent and it is several years since the Company last generated significant profits. We need investment in our business and products to generate and increase future profits and we need to manage cash to fund working capital and fund loan repayments. The fragility of our annual profit flow favored a sale of the electronic devices segment provided the price was high enough to increase shareholder value. The Company entered into an agreement to sell the electronic devices segment in March 2015; which is subject to shareholder approval through the proxy process. Many of the risks faced by the Company which have been set out below will be mitigated or eliminated if the sale and subsequent liquidation take place in accordance with the Company\u2019s plan but if the plan fails many risks remain. If we do not sell the electronic devices segment we will need to secure new business loans during 2015 or 2016 to fund and support legal and other costs incurred during the sale negotiations and fund new product development. Even with effective cash management, if the sale of the electronic devices segment fails to complete, we are unlikely to generate profits or experience positive cash flow during 2015 and this may necessitate additional cost reductions. If we incur losses, we are likely to experience negative cash flow, which may hamper our operations and may prevent us from expanding or even maintaining our business.\nWe generated profits of $877,000 after tax from operations in 2014 after sustaining a small loss in 2013, a small profit in 2012, a $2 million loss from operations in 2011, and a $6 million loss in 2010. We expect to rely on cash on hand, cash generated from our operations, existing financing arrangements and a new loan facility to fund the cash requirements of our business and the scheduled repayment of loans. If our profits do not continue to grow, we are likely to experience negative cash flow, which may hamper current operations and may prevent us from investing in and expanding our business. We may be unable to attain, sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. The Company needs cash to grow and this investment and consequent cash outflow may not result in an immediate or indeed, any increases in profit. If we do not achieve, sustain or increase profitability, our stock price may decline.\nWe have outstanding debt which the Company must repay.\nAt the beginning of 2014 we had debt in the form of promissory notes totaling $2.3 million originally issued to former shareholders of Advanced Control Components (the \u201cFormer Shareholders of ACC\u201d). These notes were redeemed from a combination of existing cash generated from within the business and an additional loan from our principal lender. The new borrowings generated net new cash of $1.2 million at a lower rate of interest than we were paying for the promissory notes. This money together with cash generated from operations was used to redeem the promissory notes and meet liabilities associated with the redemption of these notes. We continue to have credit facilities available to us under separate financing arrangements for our UK and French operations. The cost of carrying and servicing this debt affects our profitability. If we suffer a decline in the current levels of profitability and cash generation, we will need to seek new financing to ensure we can meet scheduled loan repayments as they come due, which there is no assurance that any new financing could be at favorable terms. If we are unable to do this we may have to consider the future sale of assets or sell equity to raise the capital needed to pay these debts.\nWe rely on our foreign subsidiaries to generate cash to meet Company liabilities.\nWe rely on our foreign subsidiaries to generate profits and cash with which to finance our US corporate liabilities. EMRISE does not have any facility in the United States to generate cash to pay its liabilities beyond dividends and loans from its subsidiaries and management charges imposed on those same companies. This could be alleviated in the short-term by the sale of the electronic devices segment but this would not, on its own, be a long-term solution. In the event that the overseas trading entities were unable to support EMRISE, through a the sale of one or both operating segments, through a lack of cash or through limitations on cash transfers imposed through bank covenants, loan conditions or tax factors then EMRISE would need to seek funds elsewhere. In the event that the overseas subsidiaries are unable to generate and repatriate cash to the parent Company it is likely that it would be very difficult to raise new loans in the United States to meet obligations as they fall due. There is no guarantee that generating new loans would be possible or at favorable terms to the Company.\nWe have limited cash resources which limits investment in new products, people or working capital.\nWe have bank borrowing facilities for each of our subsidiaries which are sufficient to meet our normal levels of activity within those subsidiaries. Our plans anticipate moderate growth but we cannot guarantee that this growth will be self-financing in the short term. New products and new orders require additional working capital and delays in design, production, delivery or payment from customers will put a strain on this working capital which could result in the Company running out of cash. We monitor our cash resources and cash availability against existing bank facilities very carefully but as a small company we do not have the resources to cover the eventuality of a lengthy delay in the working capital cycle. Some of our borrowing facilities are specific to individual subsidiaries and there are limitations, imposed by banking covenants, on the ability to transfer cash between these subsidiaries. In the event that one or more subsidiary requires cash in excess of its borrowing facility to meet its obligations we may be unable to transfer cash to that subsidiary even if the Company as a whole has adequate borrowing facilities.\nOur previous strategy included organic growth, which would not necessarily result in increased revenues or profitability and may have depleted our limited cash reserves without return on investment. Our acceptance of the offer to buy our electronic devices segment changes this risk but if the sale fails to complete we would need to revert to our previous organic growth strategy.\nIf we revert to our strategy to grow our business organically, focusing on sales to further increase our revenues and backlog, and ramping up manufacturing to meet the increased demand we may encounter difficulties caused by a number of factors, some of which are out of our control, including operational or personnel issues; delays in obtaining (or failure to obtain) required parts, supplies, or third-party technology; global unrest; access to credit by our customers, our suppliers, or ourselves; and our competitors may be more successful than we are technologically or in terms of sales generation. We are using cash reserves to make up-front investments in engineering and inventory. We may invest in the wrong technologies or products or the investment may not yield improved products and sales as anticipated. Our competition may make similar investments with greater success. If we fail to develop significant sales of products, it will negatively impact our business, our ability to become profitable, and results of operations. We would also expect such failure to cause fluctuations or decreases in our common stock price.\nIf we are unable to fulfill backlog orders due to circumstances involving us or one or more of our suppliers or customers, our anticipated results of operations will suffer.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $36.8 million in backlog orders for our products. This represents more than 100% of our 2014 annual revenues but not all of this backlog will be scheduled for production or delivery in 2015. Backlog orders represent revenue that we anticipate recognizing in the future, as evidenced by purchase orders and other purchase commitments received from customers, but on which work has not yet been initiated or with respect to which work is currently in progress. Our backlog orders are due, in large part, to the long lead-times associated with our electronic device products, which products generally are custom built to order. We may encounter difficulties in fulfilling these orders and commitments, which could lead to failing to deliver them in a timely manner. We may not ultimately recognize as revenue the amounts reflected as backlog. Factors that could affect our ability to fulfill backlog orders include difficulty we may experience in obtaining raw materials or sub-assemblies from suppliers, whether due to obsolescence, production difficulties on the part of suppliers, including the longer lead times we have recently seen with many suppliers, or customer-induced delays and product holds. If we were required to locate new suppliers or additional sources of supply, we could experience a disruption in our operations or incur additional costs in procuring required materials. Our anticipated results of operations and cash flows will suffer to the extent we are unable to fulfill backlog orders within established timeframes, particularly if delays in fulfilling backlog orders cause our customers to reduce or cancel their orders. Analysts and investors are likely to view us negatively if we fail to recognize as revenue the amounts reflected as backlog, which could lead to a decrease in our common stock price.\nWe may not sustain these backlog amounts in the future, particularly if we are not successful in continuing to grow our sales or if our investment in technologies and products or acquisitions fails to translate into increased sales. In the event that the electronic devices segment is sold, the backlog related to such segment would be transferred to the purchaser.\nThe sales cycles of many of our products are lengthy, exposing us to the risks of delays, foregone orders and fluctuations in operating results.\nSales of many of our products depend upon potential customers\u2019 internal approval and contracting procedures, procurement practices, and testing and acceptance processes, all of which require a significant amount of time. As a result of these and related factors, the sales cycle of many of our products, especially for large customers, typically ranges from six to twelve months. Lengthy sales cycles subject us to risks of delays, foregone orders and fluctuations in operating results. Coupled with the lack of long-term purchase orders or commitments described above, our sales revenues can fluctuate from period to period and such unpredictability could negatively affect our stock price.\nThe high costs of being a U.S. public registrant places pressure on our cash facilities.\nThe Company adopts rigorous procedures in connection with corporate governance, embracing measures that go beyond the minimum standards required by the OTCQB, Delaware State law or our own by-laws. We observe such procedures because we consider this to be in the best interest of our stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, financiers and shareholders. These measures carry a cost and these costs plus those of maintaining the quotation for our stock relative to the size of our business are high. The Company relies on its subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash to meet their own operating costs in addition to collectively meeting the costs of maintaining a public entity. A shortfall in cash generation by the subsidiaries would restrict the ability of EMRISE to meet its liabilities as they fall due.\nWe rely heavily on our management, and the loss of their services could adversely affect our business.\nOur success is highly dependent upon the continued services of key members of our management, including Carmine T. Oliva, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Graham Jefferies, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Oliva co-founded Emrise Electronics Corporation (\u201cEEC\u201d) and has developed personal contacts and other skills that we rely upon in connection with our general business strategies. Mr. Jefferies is a long-time employee of EMRISE whom we have relied upon in connection with our acquisitions and operations in England and France and who fulfills significant operational responsibilities in connection with our foreign and domestic operations. The loss of Mr. Jefferies or one or more other key members of management could adversely affect us. Although we have entered into employment or severance agreements with each of our executive officers, those agreements do not guarantee continued employment of these individuals. We maintain key-man life insurance on Messrs. Oliva and Jefferies. However, this insurance covers termination due to death and not due to any other potential reasons for their employment termination. Even if this insurance can be continued in full effect and a claim paid, the coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for the loss of the services of Mr. Jefferies.\nMany of our competitors have greater resources than we do. If we are unable to keep pace with our competitors in anticipating and responding to the rapid changes involving the electronic devices and communications equipment industries, we may not be able to compete successfully with them and thereby possibly causing our stock price to decline.\nOur future success depends, in part, upon our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services that keep pace with technological developments, respond to the growth in the electronic devices and communications equipment markets in which we compete, encompass evolving customer requirements, and provide a broad range of products and achieve market acceptance of our products. Our subsidiary companies would benefit from the additional resource that a new owner could bring.\nMost of our existing and potential competitors have larger technical staffs, more established and larger marketing and sales organizations and significantly greater financial resources than we do. Our lack of resources relative to our competitors may cause us to fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements or to experience significant delays in developing or introducing new products and services. These failures or delays could reduce our competitiveness, revenues, profit margins or market share, cash flow and stock price.\nThe fragile global economy:\n\u25cf has had and may continue to have significant negative effects on our customers and our suppliers;\n\u25cf has had and may continue to have significant negative effects on our access to credit and our ability to raise capital;\n\u25cf may prevent us from accurately forecasting demand for our product;\n\u25cf may increase the risk that we could suffer unrecoverable losses on our customers\u2019 accounts receivable; or\n\u25cf may increase the risk that we cannot sell inventory that is on hand, resulting in excess inventory levels; and may therefore negatively affect our business, market share, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company operates in a global market which is sensitive to oil prices, world unrest and economic uncertainty. Confidence in the world economy since the global financial crisis has been fragile and this manifested itself, among other things, in significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit, substantial reductions and/or fluctuations in equity and currency values worldwide, and concerns that the worldwide economic recession may be prolonged. This has had and may continue to have a significant negative effect on our business and operating results. The potential effects of the fragile global economy are difficult to forecast and mitigate. As a consequence, our operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.\nThe economic crisis and recession has affected and may continue to affect our direct and indirect customers\u2019 access to capital or willingness to spend capital on our products, and/or their levels of cash liquidity or willingness to pay for products that they will order or have already ordered from us. The effect of the current economic conditions on our customers may therefore lead to decreased demand, including order delays or cancellations, which in turn may result in lower revenue and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLikewise, the current global economy may negatively affect our suppliers\u2019 access to capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventories and production levels and could cause them to raise prices or lower production levels, or result in their ceasing operations. The challenges that our suppliers may face in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses may lead to our inability to obtain the materials we use to manufacture our products. Indeed, we have observed a trend among our suppliers to have decreased inventory and therefore longer lead times in obtaining parts, supplies and other goods. These actions could cause us to have longer lead times in producing products for delivery to our customers, reductions in our revenue, increased price competition and increased operating costs, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe current economy and related market instability has made it difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, particularly in our communications equipment segment. If, as a result, we produce excess products, our inventory carrying costs will increase and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, due to the forecasting difficulty caused by the unstable economic conditions, we may be unable to satisfy demand for our products, which may in turn result in a loss of business opportunities and market share.\nWe finance a portion of our sales through trade credit. While we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition, we could suffer significant losses if our customers are unable or unwilling to pay us. Our record of losses from being unable to recover accounts receivable has been good but while global economic conditions continue, there is a risk of losses of accounts receivable that may have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur defense and aerospace programs are highly dependent on economic and political factors which are outside of our control. Changes in defense budgets in countries around the world and/or changes in priorities on such spending could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe sell our commercial and military electronic devices primarily to OEMs, including manufacturers of aerospace and defense systems and industrial instruments. We are highly dependent on defense budgets to utilize our products in various electronic warfare applications. Changes in defense budgets and/or changes in priorities of defense budgets may reduce or redirect defense spending. If defense spending is reduced or redirected, it may affect our current contracts as well as our ability to procure additional defense contracts, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to various legal, business, political and economic risks associated with our international operations, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe undertake various sales and marketing activities through our facilities in England and France. Sales by these foreign business units accounted for 97% our net sales in 2014 and will account for 100% of our sales in 2015 and beyond. International operations are subject to many other inherent risks, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf import and export license requirements and restrictions of the U.S. and each other country in which we operate;\n\u25cf exposure to different business practices and legal standards, particularly with respect to intellectual property;\n\u25cf repatriation of profits;\n\u25cf the imposition or changes to regulations, governmental controls and restrictions;\n\u25cf burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u25cf changes in taxation and tariffs; and\n\u25cf the reliance of the U.S. business on foreign governments.\nAny of the factors described above may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales. Many of the factors described above, particularly currency exchange rates, have an impact on our financial results and/or on our liquidity and working capital position, which can be negative and can be material.\nIf our products fail to comply with evolving government and industry standards and regulations, we may have difficulty selling our products and/or we may incur significant warranty liabilities associated with existing products.\nWe design our products to comply with a significant number of industry standards and regulations, some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed. Our products must comply with various regulations defined by the Federal Communications Commission and Underwriters Laboratories, the American National Standards Institute, among others, as well as industry standards such as those established by Telcordia Technologies, Inc. (communications), Federal Aviation Authority (aerospace) and The Boeing Company, among others. Internationally, our products must comply with standards established by the European Committee for Electro technical Standardization, the European Committee for Standardization, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, and telecommunications authorities in various countries as well as with recommendations of the International Telecommunications Union, Airbus and various civil aviation authorities, among others. Our products for the military markets are typically tested and require the production of a first article and other prototypes, which are subject to testing to meet specific customer and government regulations. The failure of our products to comply, or delays in compliance, with the various existing and evolving standards could negatively affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products in the future and/or may result in significant warranty liability for noncompliance on existing products.\nFinancial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are prepared using the relevant foreign currency that must be converted into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, exchange rate fluctuations have historically and may in the future materially adversely affect our reported results of operations.\nOur subsidiaries in England and France prepare their financial statements in the relevant local foreign currency. In order to be included in our consolidated financial statements, the balance sheets are converted, at the then current exchange rate, into U.S. dollars, and the statements of operations are converted using average exchange rates for the applicable period. Fluctuations of the foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar have materially affected and may in the future materially affect our consolidated financial statements. Sales of our products and services from these subsidiaries outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 97% of our net sales in 2014 and 95% of our sales in 2013. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature.\nThe magnitude of these gains or losses depends upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business as compared to the value of the U.S. dollar. During 2014, these currencies included the euro and the British pound sterling. Any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher or lower than those we recorded for these periods. The relevant rates for 2014 and 2013 were:\nNet foreign exchange translation gains and losses included in other income and expense in our consolidated statements of operations resulted in a profit of $283,000 for 2014 and a loss of $130,000 for 2013. We cannot control currency fluctuations and future losses could be greater than in the past.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline.\nWhen we acquire a business, we assign estimated values to certain intangible assets and we also record an asset called \u201cgoodwill\u201d equal to the excess amount we pay for the business, including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire. Guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the \u201cCodification\u201d) provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but instead be tested at least annually for impairment, and intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Codification provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non-amortized intangible assets for impairment. This guidance requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities, including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, cost of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches. Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our impairment tests annually at year end. As part of our 2014 and 2013 annual tests for impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets, we noted no events of impairment. Any future impairment, could negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized which, in turn, may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nBecause we believe that proprietary rights are material to our success, misappropriation of these rights could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur future success is highly dependent on proprietary technology, particularly in our communications equipment business. However, we do not hold any patents and we currently rely on a combination of contractual rights, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights in this area. Our management believes that because of the rapid pace of technological change in the industries in which we operate, the legal intellectual property protection for our products is a less significant factor in our success than the knowledge, abilities and experience of our employees; the frequency of our product enhancements; the effectiveness of our marketing activities; and the timeliness and quality of our support services. Consequently, we rely to a great extent on trade secret protection for much of our technology. However, there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors or customers will not independently develop comparable or superior technologies or obtain unauthorized access to our proprietary technology, which can be difficult and expensive to monitor and enforce. Our financial condition would be materially adversely affected if we were to lose our competitive position due to our inability to adequately protect our proprietary rights as our technology evolves.\nBreaches of data security could negatively impact our business.\nOur products, services, and systems may affect critical third party operations. Breaches in security could expose the Company, our customers or others to risks of loss, resulting in litigation and potential liability for us, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nBecause we depend on computer and telecommunications systems we do not own or control, we are potentially subject to the adverse effects of third party operational system failures.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and database services in connection with the operation of our facilities. We have several licenses from third parties. We may be subject to disruptions of our operational systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, epidemics, computer viruses and telecommunications outages). These third party systems and licenses on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties, to our computing and communications infrastructure, or our information systems could significantly disrupt our business operations and result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Proposal to Approve the Transaction\nIf we fail to complete the Transaction, our business may be harmed.\nWe cannot provide assurances that the Transaction will be completed. The closing of the Transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including but not limited to shareholder approval and the absence of a material adverse effect on EEL\u2019s business. If the Transaction is terminated because the Company fails to hold a special meeting to approve the Transaction within a specified time period or if the Transaction is not approved by stockholders, we will be required to pay up to $300,000 of DDC\u2019s expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction. In certain other circumstances (as described in further detail in the Purchase Agreement), we will be required to pay to DDC up to $800,000 of DDC\u2019s expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction.\nAs a result of our announcement of the Transaction, third parties may be unwilling to enter into material agreements with respect to the electronic devices business segment. New or existing customers and business partners may prefer to enter into agreements with our competitors who have not expressed an intention to sell their business because customers and business partners may perceive that such new relationships are likely to be more stable. If we fail to complete the Transaction, the failure to maintain existing business relationships or enter into new ones could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if the Transaction is not completed, the market price for our common stock may decline.\nOur announcement of the Transaction may cause employees working for EEL and its subsidiaries to become concerned about the future of the business and lose focus or seek other employment.\nIn addition, if the Transaction is not completed, our directors, executive officers and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and experienced significant distractions from their work during the pendency of the Transaction and we will have incurred significant third party transaction costs, in each case, without any commensurate benefit, which may have a material and adverse effect on our stock price and results of operations.\nIf the Transaction is not completed, we may explore other potential transactions involving the Company and its electronic devices business segment. The terms of such an alternative transaction may be less favorable to us than the terms of the Transaction and there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach agreement with or complete such an alternative transaction with another party.\nThe failure to complete the Transaction may result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock and limit our ability to implement our business strategies.\nThe completion of the Transaction is subject to a number of contingencies, including approval by our stockholders and other closing conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. We cannot predict whether we will succeed in obtaining the approval of our stockholders or whether the other conditions to closing the Transaction pursuant to the Purchase Agreement will be satisfied. As a result, we cannot offer assurance that the Transaction will be completed. In the event that the Transaction is not completed, this may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, operating results and financial condition and the market value of our common stock may decline.\nRisk Factor Related to the Plan of Dissolution\nIf our stockholders vote against the Plan of Dissolution proposal, our business could be harmed.\nIf we do not obtain stockholder approval of the Plan of Dissolution, we would have to continue our business operations despite the sale of substantially all of our assets and our announced dissolution. Assuming the completion of the Transaction, we would have limited assets with which to generate operating revenue and likely will have retained only those employees required to wind-up our corporate existence.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThere is limited trading and investor interest in our stock which creates risks for investors when trying to sell our stock and limits the Company\u2019s ability to raise cash for expansion or working capital by placing our stock.\nOur stock is quoted on the OTCQB trading venue but trading volumes are low due to limited investor interest in Micro Cap stocks, lack of liquidity in the stock, a negative stock price trend and a very low market capitalization. The stock price is volatile and responds to relatively small blocks of shares being bought or sold with disproportionate price swings. This limits the Company\u2019s ability to use the stock to raise capital or to fund any strategic growth initiatives including mergers or acquisitions without a significant dilution of existing stockholders.\nOur common stock price has been volatile, which has resulted in substantial losses for some investors purchasing shares of our common stock and could result in further losses or litigation against the Company.\nThe market prices of securities of technology-based companies have been and will likely continue to be highly volatile. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past. During 2014, the high and low closing sale prices of a share of our common stock were $1.10 and $0.55, respectively, and the average closing price across the year was $0.84. Our stock price has exhibited volatility and may continue to do so in the future. In addition, the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate in response to the following factors, many of which are beyond our control:\n\u25cf our success or failure to execute on our business strategy;\n\u25cf whether the Company can become profitable and whether it can sustain profitability;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf foreign currency translations gains or losses;\n\u25cf fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results and whether such results meet investor expectations;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of similar companies and stock market price and volume fluctuations generally;\n\u25cf general global economic weakness;\n\u25cf economic conditions specific to the electronic devices or communications equipment industries;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new or enhanced products, technologies or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf delays in our introduction of new products or technological innovations or problems in the functioning of these new products or innovations;\n\u25cf third parties\u2019 infringement of our intellectual property rights, or our potential infringement of another party\u2019s intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u25cf regulatory developments;\n\u25cf future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u25cf perception and confidence of investors regarding future prospects for the Company.\nThe price at which you purchase shares of common stock may not be indicative of the price of our stock that will prevail in the trading market. You may be unable to sell your shares of common stock at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you. Moreover, in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources and could have a significant impact on profitability, future cash flows and stock price.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock by our stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for sale will have on the market price prevailing from time to time. As of March 27, 2015, we had approximately 10.8 million shares of common stock outstanding and 0.3 million outstanding options. A substantial number of these shares are eligible for public resale. Sales of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease or to be lower than it might be in the absence of those sales or perceptions.\nBecause our market capitalization is small, we could remain a target for a buyer or subject to a hostile takeover at a value that is less than the value that could be realized in a planned sale and liquidation.\nBecause of the Company\u2019s current common stock price, aggregate market capitalization and potential market value of its assets, and its annual revenue, the Company may be an attractive target to a buyer or subject to a hostile takeover at a depressed value. Such price could be at a premium to the market price at the time of the transaction and still be significantly below the purchase price paid by most stockholders. The Company\u2019s stock is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of groups of independent shareholders which could exercise their rights to influence the strategic direction of the Company to the detriment of the existing plans. If a takeover attempt occurred, it might cause distractions for our management and our Board and this might prevent us from executing on our strategic plans, preserving the value of the Company for creditors and stockholders and growing the Company. In addition, a successful takeover attempt might result in a change of the Company\u2019s management and directors.\nThe volatility of our quarterly and annual operating results may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline.\nOur quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. Sometimes these factors can cause more prolonged periods of increased or decreased operating results, measured in quarters or years.\nThe cyclical nature of the communications equipment business due to the budgetary cycle of many of our key customers in this segment has had and will likely continue to have, for the foreseeable future, an effect on our quarterly operating results. Companies that utilize our communication equipment generally obtain approval for their annual budgets during the first quarter of each calendar year. If a company\u2019s annual budget is not approved early in the calendar year or is insufficient to cover its desired purchases for the entire calendar year, then we are unable to sell products to the company during the period of the delay or shortfall. In addition, these budgets historically tend to vary significantly year by year, depending on a variety of factors, including overall economic conditions. A significant reduction in any one customer\u2019s or group of customer\u2019s budgets could reduce our overall sales, profits and cash flows in the future.\nSales of our electronic devices are often made in conjunction with large military or commercial aerospace contracts. The timing of required deliveries under these contracts can be delayed based on issues related to the overall contract, which can cause delays in our shipment schedules, revenue recognition, profits and cash flows. In periods between completion of one long term contract and commencement of sales under a new contract, our revenues could be reduced. The impact of these periods between contracts can last for months, quarters or, occasionally, years.\nQuarter-to-quarter fluctuations may also result from the uneven pace of technological innovation, the development of products responding to these technological innovations by us and our competitors, our customers\u2019 acceptance of these products and innovations, the varied degree of price, product and technological competition and our customers\u2019 and competitors\u2019 responses to these changes.\nDue to these and other factors, including changes in general economic conditions, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful in predicting future performance. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors, our stock price may fluctuate or decline.", "PERMNO": 86319, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "EMRI"}
