{"cik": "1409775", "company": "BBVA COMPASS BANCSHARES, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThis section highlights the material risks that the Company currently faces. Any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAny deterioration in national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices, could materially affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company's business is subject to periodic fluctuations based on national, regional and local economic conditions. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled, and may have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and operations even if other favorable events occur. The Company's banking operations are locally-oriented and community-based. Accordingly, the Company expects to continue to be dependent upon local business conditions as well as conditions in the local residential and commercial real estate markets it serves, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Texas. These economic conditions could require the Company to charge-off a higher percentage of loans or increase provisions for credit losses, which would reduce its net income.\nThe Company is part of the financial system and a systemic lack of available credit, a lack of confidence in the financial sector, continued volatility in the financial markets and/or reduced business activity could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA return of the volatile economic conditions experienced in the U.S. during 2008-2009, including the adverse conditions in the fixed income debt markets, for an extended period of time, particularly if left unmitigated by policy measures, may materially and adversely affect the Company.\nWeakness in the real estate market has adversely affected the Company in the past and may do so in the future.\nAt December 31, 2018, residential real estate loans totaled $13.4 billion, or 20.6% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio and commercial real estate loans totaled $13.0 billion, or 20.0% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio. Declining residential real estate prices have historically caused cyclically higher delinquencies and losses on residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. These conditions have resulted in losses, write-downs and impairment charges in the Company's mortgage and other business units.\nFuture declines in residential real estate values, low sales volumes, the fluctuating valuation of collateral, financial stress on borrowers as a result of unemployment, interest rate resets on ARMs or other factors could have adverse effects on borrowers that could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods. Similar trends may be observed in the commercial real estate loan portfolio in times of general or localized economic downturns. Further, decreases in real estate values generally might adversely affect the creditworthiness of state and local governments, and this might result in decreased profitability or credit losses from loans made to such governments. In markets dependent on energy production, falling energy prices may adversely affect real estate values.\nA decline in real estate values or overall economic weakness could also have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate or other assets which the Company owns as a result of foreclosing a loan and its ability to realize value on such assets. Any of these conditions, should they occur, could adversely affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nIneffective liquidity management could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results and condition.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of the Company\u2019s business. The Company requires sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. The Company\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance activities on terms that are acceptable to the Company could be impaired by factors that affect the Company specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact the Company\u2019s access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated or difficult credit markets. The Company\u2019s access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of the Company\u2019s depositors. In particular, a majority of the Company\u2019s liabilities during 2018 were checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days\u2019 notice, while by comparison, a substantial majority of the Company\u2019s assets were loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time\nframe. Although the Company has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, the Company might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a large number of the Company\u2019s depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to credit risk.\nWhen the Company loans money, commits to loan money or enters into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, it incurs credit risk, which is the risk of losses if its borrowers do not repay their loans or its counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their contracts. Many of the Company's products expose it to credit risk, including loans, leases and lending commitments.\nThe Company may suffer increased losses in its loan portfolio despite enhancement of its underwriting policies and practices, and the Company's allowances for credit losses may not be adequate to cover such eventual losses.\nThe Company seeks to mitigate risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting policies and practices, which often include analysis of (1) a borrower's credit history, financial statements, tax returns and cash flow projections; (2) valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers; and (3) verification of liquid assets. The Company's underwriting policies, practices and standards are periodically reviewed and, if appropriate, enhanced in response to changing market conditions and/or corporate strategies.\nLike other financial institutions, the Company maintains allowances for credit losses to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance. The Company's allowances for credit losses may not be adequate to cover eventual loan losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FASB's Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), will substantially change the accounting for credit losses under current U.S. GAAP standards. Under current U.S. GAAP standards, credit losses are not reflected in financial statements until it is probable that the credit loss has been incurred. Under this ASU, an entity will be required to reflect in its financial statements its current estimate of credit losses on financial assets over the expected life of each financial asset. This ASU may have a negative impact on the Company's reported earnings, capital, regulatory capital ratios, as well as on regulatory limits which are based on capital (e.g., loans to affiliates) since it would accelerate the recognition of estimated credit losses. In December 2018, the U.S. federal banking agencies finalized rules that permit bank holding companies and banks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new current expected credit loss accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years.\nChanges in interest rates could affect the Company's income and cash flows.\nThe Company's earnings and financial condition are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate spreads, meaning the difference between interest rates earned on loans and investments and the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings, could adversely affect the Company's earnings and financial condition. In addition, changes in interest rates may impact the fair value of our fixed-rate securities and the extent to which customers prepay mortgages and other loans. The Company cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates.\nRegional and local economic conditions, competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board, affect interest income and interest expense. Following a prolonged period in which the federal funds rate was stable or decreasing, the Federal Reserve Board has begun to increase this benchmark rate. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has stated its intention to end its quantitative easing program and has begun to reduce the size of its balance sheet by selling securities, which might also affect interest rates. The Company has policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates, however, may still have an adverse effect on the Company's profitability. While the Company actively manages against these risks, if its assumptions regarding borrower behavior are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than planned for, then its risk mitigation techniques may be insufficient to protect against the risk.\nThe Company is subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages. It may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud or certain breaches of its servicing agreements, and this could harm the Company's liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company originates and often sells mortgage loans. When it sells mortgage loans, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, the Company is required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. The Company's whole loan sale agreements require it to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event that it breaches certain of these representations or warranties. In addition, the Company may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. Likewise, the Company is required to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans if it breaches a representation or warranty in connection with its securitizations, whether or not it was the originator of the loan. While in many cases it may have a remedy available against certain parties, often these may not be as broad as the remedies available to a purchaser of mortgage loans against it, and the Company faces the further risk that such parties may not have the financial capacity to satisfy remedies that may be available to it. Therefore, if a purchaser enforces its remedies against it, the Company may not be able to recover its losses from third parties. The Company has received repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers. These have resulted in an increase in the amount of losses for repurchases. While the Company has taken steps to enhance its underwriting policies and procedures, these steps will not reduce risk associated with loans sold in the past. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase materially, the Company's results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company is at risk of increased losses from fraud.\nCriminals committing fraud increasingly are using more sophisticated techniques and in some cases are part of larger criminal rings, which allow them to be more effective. Fraudulent activity has taken many forms and escalates as more tools for accessing financial services emerge, such as real-time payments. Fraud schemes are broad and continuously evolving and include such things as debit card/credit card fraud, check fraud, mechanical devices attached to ATM machines, social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information, or impersonation of our clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials. Additionally, an individual or business entity may properly identify themselves, yet seek to establish a business relationship for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. An emerging type of fraud involves the creation of synthetic identification in which fraudsters \u201ccreate\u201d individuals for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. Further, in addition to fraud committed against us, we may suffer losses as a result of fraudulent activity committed against third parties. Increased deployment of technologies, such as chip card technology, defray and reduce aspects of fraud; however, criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information, such as unaffiliated healthcare providers and government entities, in order to impersonate the consumer to commit fraud. Many of these data compromises have been widely reported in the media. Further, as a result of the increased sophistication of fraud activity, we have increased our spending on systems and controls to detect and prevent fraud. This will result in continued ongoing investments in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt its business and adversely impact its results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.\nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout the Company\u2019s business and, as a result of its interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to the Company\u2019s own internal operational functions. The Company\u2019s operational and security systems and infrastructure, including its computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to its performance. The Company relies on employees and third parties in its day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance or failure, or breach of the Company\u2019s or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose the Company to risk. For example, the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to the Company or to third parties with whom it interacts or upon whom it relies. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to its own systems. The Company\u2019s financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, which could adversely affect its ability to process transactions or provide services. Such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods;\ndisease pandemics; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including wars and terrorist acts. In addition, the Company may need to take its systems offline if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyber-attack. The Company's business may be susceptible to infrastructure outages because its data centers are located outside the U.S. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as the Company\u2019s primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data. The Company frequently updates its systems to support its operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Implementation and testing of controls related to the Company\u2019s computer systems, security monitoring and retaining and training personnel required to operate its systems also entail significant costs. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. In addition, the Company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.\nThe Company faces security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting its colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect its business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.\nThe Company\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which it is highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. The Company\u2019s business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in its computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access the Company\u2019s network, products and services, its customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of its network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.\nThe Company, its customers, regulators and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in the Company\u2019s systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of the Company, its employees, its customers or of third parties, damage its systems or otherwise materially disrupt the Company\u2019s or its customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 network access or business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of the Company\u2019s systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, the Company may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may it be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and the Company may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.\nCybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as the Company continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand its internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks and \"spear phishing\" attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. In such an attack, an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers or other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred. The\nrisk of a security breach caused by a cyber-attack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-party vendors with access to the Company\u2019s data may not be disclosed to it in a timely manner.\nThe Company also faces indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers, clients and other third parties with whom it does business or upon whom it relies to facilitate or enable its business activities, including, for example, financial counterparties, regulators and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including the Company. This consolidation, interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach, termination or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to effect transactions, service its clients, manage its exposure to risk or expand its business.\nCyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at the Company or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on its systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage the Company\u2019s reputation with customers and third parties with whom it does business. Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause the Company serious negative consequences, including loss of customers and business opportunities, significant business disruption to its operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of its confidential information and/or that of its customers, or damage to the Company\u2019s or its customers\u2019 and/or third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact its results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While the Company has selected these third-party vendors carefully, performing upfront due diligence and ongoing monitoring activities, even with a strong oversight in place, the Company does not entirely control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in services provided by a vendor (including as a result of a cyber-attack, other information security event or a natural disaster), financial or operational difficulties for the vendor, or resulting from issues at third-party vendors to the vendors, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason, poor performance of services, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of our vendors, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to the Company\u2019s customers, the Company\u2019s reputation and the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its business. In certain situation, replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable, inherent risk to the Company\u2019s business operations.\nCybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.\nAs cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including the Company and the Bank, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data.\nThe Company receives, maintains and stores non-public personal information of its customers and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information. The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state law. Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected and handled.\nThe Company may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information it may store or maintain. The Company could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that it is required to alter its systems or require changes to its business practices or privacy policies. If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with the Company\u2019s current practices, the Company may be subject to fines, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change its business practices, policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts its operating results.\nThe Company is subject to legislation and regulation, and future legislation or regulation or changes to existing legislation or regulation could affect its business.\nThe legislative, regulatory and supervisory framework governing the financial sector has undergone significant and rapid change since the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act as well as other post-financial crisis regulatory reforms in the United States have increased costs, imposed limitations on activities and resulted in an increased intensity in regulatory enforcement. While most of the changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act that impact the Company have been implemented or are expected to follow a known trajectory, the impact of changes under EGRRCPA or other statutory or regulatory relief initiatives cannot be determined with certainty.\nChanges to laws and regulations at both the state or federal level applicable to the Company are frequently proposed and could materially impact the profitability of the Company's business, the value of assets it holds or the collateral available for its loans, require changes to business practices or expose it to additional costs, taxes, liabilities, enforcement actions and reputational risk. The likelihood, timing and scope of any such changes and the impact any such change may have on the Company cannot be determined with any certainty.\nThe Company and the Bank are regulated and supervised by the CFPB. The CFPB has promulgated many mortgage-related rules since it was established under the Dodd-Frank Act, including rules related to the ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requirements and appraisal and escrow standards for higher-priced mortgages. The mortgage-related rules issued by the CFPB have materially restructured the origination, servicing and securitization of residential mortgages in the United States. These rules have impacted, and will continue to impact, the business practices of mortgage lenders, including the Company and the Bank.\nCompliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules involves significant cost and effort.\nThe Company is subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Monitoring compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules and regulations can put a significant financial burden on banks and other financial institutions and poses significant technical problems. Although the Company has internal policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules and regulations, it cannot guarantee that its policies and procedures completely prevent violations of such rules and regulations. Any such violations may have severe consequences, including sanctions, fines and reputational consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe costs and effects of litigation, regulatory investigations, examinations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments relating thereto, could materially affect the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company faces legal risks in its business, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high and are escalating. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against the Company may have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm its business prospects.\nThe Company and its operations are subject to increased regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, thereby increasing the Company\u2019s costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. In particular, inquiries could develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions and may increase the Company's compliance costs, require changes in the Company's business practices, affect the Company's competitiveness, impair the Company's profitability, harm the Company's reputation or otherwise adversely affect the Company's business.\nIn February 2015, the Federal Reserve Board announced the results of its regularly scheduled examination covering 2011 and 2012 to determine the Bank\u2019s compliance with the CRA. The CRA requires the Federal Reserve Board to evaluate the record of the Bank in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The Bank received a rating of \u201cneeds to improve.\" The Bank\u2019s rating in this CRA examination resulted in restrictions on certain activities, including certain mergers and acquisitions and applications to open branches or certain other facilities. These restrictions were removed when the Bank received a \u201cSatisfactory\u201d CRA rating in its subsequent exam. The Bank received an \"Outstanding\" rating in its most recent CRA examination encompassing the period from 2015 to 2017. The Bank must maintain a CRA rating of at least \"Satisfactory\" for the Company to engage in the full range of activities permissible for financial holding companies.\nThe Company's insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it and indemnification rights to which it is entitled may not be honored. Any claims asserted against the Company, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm its reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed the Company's insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, premiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors are rising. The Company may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may it be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates, if at all.\nThe Company is exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs.\nThe Company is required to comply with various anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the United Nations Security Council and the United States, including OFAC. The anti-corruption laws generally prohibit providing anything of value to government officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. As part of its business, the Company may deal with entities, the employees of which are considered government officials. In addition, as noted above in Part I, Item 1 (\u201cAnti-Money Laundering; USA PATRIOT Act; Office of Foreign Assets Control\u201d), economic sanctions programs restrict the Company from conducting certain transactions or dealings involving certain sanctioned countries or persons.\nAlthough the Company has internal policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be sufficient or that the Company\u2019s employees, directors, officers, partners, agents and service providers will not take actions in violation of the Company\u2019s policies and procedures (or otherwise in violation of the relevant anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations) for which they or the Company may ultimately be held responsible. Violations of anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations could lead to financial penalties being imposed on the Company, limits being placed on the Company\u2019s activities, authorizations or licenses being revoked, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-corruption laws or sanctions regulations could be costly.\nUncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-\nbased securities, including the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock, Capital Securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and other interest rates. In the event that a published LIBOR rate is unavailable after 2021, the dividend rate on the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock and the interest rate on the Company\u2019s Capital Securities and other obligations, which are currently based on the LIBOR rate, will be determined as set forth in the accompanying offering documents, and the value of such securities may be adversely affected. Currently, the manner and impact of this transition and related developments, as well as the effect of these developments on the Company\u2019s funding costs, investment and trading securities, loan portfolios and business, is uncertain.\nDowngrades to the U.S. government's credit rating, or the credit rating of its securities, by one or more of the credit ratings agencies could have a material adverse effect on general economic conditions, as well as the Company's operations, earnings and financial condition.\nIt is foreseeable that the ratings and perceived creditworthiness of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by institutions, agencies or instrumentalities directly linked to the U.S. government could be correspondingly affected by any downgrade to the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, including the rating of U.S. Treasury securities. Instruments of this nature are key assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions, including the Company, and are widely used as collateral by financial institutions to meet their day-to-day cash flows in the short-term debt market.\nA downgrade of the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, and the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations, could impact the Company's ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affecting the pricing of that funding when it is available. A downgrade may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments. The Company cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. Such ratings actions could result in a significant adverse impact on the Company. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which the Company is subject and any related adverse effects on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA reduction in the Company's own credit rating could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and increase the cost of its capital markets funding.\nAdequate liquidity is essential to the Company's businesses. A reduction to the Company's credit rating could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rating agencies regularly evaluate the Company and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including the Company's financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. Adverse changes in the credit ratings of the Kingdom of Spain, which subsequently could impact BBVA, could also adversely impact the Company's credit rating. There can be no assurance that the Company will maintain its current ratings. The Company's failure to maintain those ratings could increase its borrowing costs, require the Company to replace funding lost due to the downgrade, which may include the loss of customer deposits, and may also limit the Company's access to capital and money markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements.\nThe Company's ability to access the capital markets is important to its overall funding profile. This access is affected by its credit rating. The interest rates that the Company pays on its securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that it receives from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to the Company's credit rating could affect its ability to access the capital markets, increase its borrowing costs and negatively impact its profitability. A ratings downgrade to the Company's credit rating could also create obligations or liabilities for it under the terms of its outstanding securities that could increase its costs or otherwise have a negative effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by the Company could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.\nThe financial services market is undergoing rapid technological changes, and the Company may be unable to effectively compete or may experience heightened cyber-security and/or fraud risks as a result of these changes.\nThe financial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and may enable the Company to reduce costs. The Company's future success may depend, in part, on its ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in its operations. Some of the Company's competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. As a result, the Company's ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and its business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company is under continuous threat of loss due to cyber-attacks, especially as it continues to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that it faces are e-fraud and breach of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customers' or the Company's accounts. A breach of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to the Company.\nOver the past few years, there have been a series of distributed denial of service attacks on financial services companies. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to saturate the targeted online network with excessive amounts of network traffic, resulting in slow response times, or in some cases, causing the site to be temporarily unavailable. Generally, these attacks have not been conducted to steal financial data, but meant to interrupt or suspend a company's internet service. While these events may not result in a breach of client data and account information, the attacks can adversely affect the performance of a company\u2019s website and in some instances have prevented customers from accessing a company\u2019s website. Distributed denial of service attacks, hacking and identity theft risks could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and the Company may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. The Company's risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, its plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels, and its plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve its customers. The Company may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.\nAdditionally, fraud risk may increase as the Company offers more products online or through mobile channels.\nThe Company is subject to intense competition in the financial services industry, particularly in its market area, which could result in losing business or margin declines.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative, regulatory and technological changes, as well as continued consolidation. The Company faces aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services. The ability of non-banking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition. Because non-banking financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking, and may acquire banks and other financial institutions. This may significantly change the competitive environment in which the Company conducts business. Some of the Company's competitors have greater financial resources and/or face fewer regulatory constraints. As a result of these various sources of competition, the Company could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, either of which would adversely affect its profitability.\nSome of the Company's larger competitors, including certain national banks that have a significant presence in its market area, may have greater capital and resources than the Company, may have higher lending limits and may offer products and services not offered by the Company. Although the Company remains strong, stable and well capitalized,\nmanagement cannot predict the reaction of customers and other third parties with which it conducts business with respect to the strength of the Company relative to its competitors, including its larger competitors. Any potential adverse reactions to the Company's financial condition or status in the marketplace, as compared to its competitors, could limit its ability to attract and retain customers and to compete for new business opportunities. The inability to attract and retain customers or to effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company also experiences competition from a variety of institutions outside of its market area. Some of these institutions conduct business primarily over the internet and may thus be able to realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the customer who can obtain loans, pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. This \u201cdisintermediation\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect the Company's operations, and the Company may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes.\nCustomers could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing the Company to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding.\nChecking and savings account balances and other forms of client deposits could decrease if customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, provide superior expected returns. When clients move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments, the Company can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, thus increasing its funding costs.\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, the Company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. The Company also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors.\nNegative public opinion could damage the Company's reputation and adversely impact business and revenues.\nAs a financial institution, the Company's earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. The reputation of the financial services industry in general has been damaged as a result of the financial crisis and other matters affecting the financial services industry, including mortgage foreclosure issues. Negative public opinion regarding the Company could result from its actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, the failure of any product or service sold by it to meet its clients' expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, breach of sensitive customer information, a cybersecurity incident, corporate governance and acquisitions, or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. The Company could also be adversely affected by negative public opinion involving BBVA. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company's ability to keep, attract and/or retain clients and personnel, and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by one of the Company's businesses can result in negative public opinion about its other businesses. Negative public opinion could also affect the Company's credit ratings, which are important to accessing unsecured wholesale borrowings. Significant changes in these ratings could change the cost and availability of these sources of funding.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by its reputation. Public perception of the financial services industry in general was damaged as a result of the credit crisis that started in 2008. Significant harm to its reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, litigation, GSE or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, failing to address customer and agency complaints, compliance failures, unauthorized release of confidential information due to cyber-attacks or otherwise, and the activities of the Company\u2019s clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors. Actions by the financial service industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry can adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, indirectly by association. All of these could adversely affect its growth, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company is a subsidiary of BBVA Group, and activities across BBVA Group could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company is a part of a highly diversified international financial group which offers a wide variety of financial and related products and services including retail banking, asset management, private banking and wholesale banking. The BBVA Group strives to foster a culture in which its employees act with integrity and feel comfortable reporting instances of misconduct. The BBVA Group employees are essential to this culture, and acts of misconduct by any employee, and particularly by senior management, could erode trust and confidence and damage the BBVA Group and the Company\u2019s reputation among existing and potential clients and other stakeholders. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct by the BBVA Group entities in any number of activities or circumstances, including operations, employment-related offenses such as sexual harassment and discrimination, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of data and systems, and the satisfaction of client expectations, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct.\nFor example, BBVA is currently conducting an investigation regarding allegations of improper activity related to its relationship with Grupo Cenyt which may have violated its ethical standards and applicable governance or regulatory obligations. Governmental authorities are also investigating this matter. This matter or any similar matters arising across the Group could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely affect the confidence of the Company\u2019s clients, rating agencies, regulators, bondholders and other parties and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company's framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the Company.\nThe Company's risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage its risk exposure. The framework to manage risk, including the framework's underlying assumptions, may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances. If the risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company's financial reporting controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or fraud.\nFinancial reporting disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Any disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in the control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nVolatile or declining oil prices could adversely affect the Company's performance.\nAs of December 31, 2018, energy-related loan balances represented approximately 4.3 percent of the Bank\u2019s total loan portfolio. This amount is comprised of loans directly related to energy, such as exploration and production, pipeline transportation of natural gas, crude oil and other refined petroleum products, oil field services, and refining and support. In late 2014, oil prices began to decline and continued to decline through the first half of 2016, which has had an adverse effect on some of the Bank\u2019s borrowers in this portfolio and on the value of the collateral securing some of these loans. If oil prices decline in a material way, the cash flows of the Bank\u2019s customers in this industry could be adversely impacted which could impair their ability to service any loans outstanding to them and/or reduce demand for loans. These factors could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurthermore, energy production and related industries represent a significant part of the economies in some of the Bank\u2019s primary markets. A prolonged period of low or volatile oil prices could have a negative impact on the economies and real estate markets of states such as Texas, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition of member countries, especially in Spain, could have an adverse impact on global financial markets, the current U.S. economic recovery and the Company.\nCertain European Union member countries have fiscal obligations greater than their fiscal revenue, which has caused investor concern over such countries' ability to continue to service their debt and foster economic growth. Fiscal austerity measures such as raising taxes and reducing entitlements have improved the ability of some member countries to service their debt, but have challenged economic growth and efforts to lower unemployment rates in the region. Although the fiscal health and economic outlook of Spain and the European Union, more generally, have improved, there is no guarantee that these trends will continue.\nThe Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of BBVA, which is based in Spain and serves as a source of strength and capital to the Company. Accordingly, European Union weakness, particularly in Spain, could directly impact BBVA and could have an adverse impact on the Company's business or financial condition.\nA weaker European economy may transcend Europe, cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of European financial institutions and the stability of European member economies, and likewise affect U.S.-based financial institutions, the stability of the global financial markets and the economic recovery underway in the U.S. Should the U.S. economic recovery be adversely impacted by these factors, loan and asset growth at U.S. financial institutions, like the Company, could be affected.\nThe Company is subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards, and if it fails to meet these standards its financial condition and operations would be adversely affected.\nThe U.S. Basel III capital rule and provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act increased capital requirements for banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank and will continue to increase such requirements as they are phased in. Consistent with the Basel Committee's Basel III capital framework, the U.S. Basel III capital rule includes a minimum ratio of CET1 capital to risk weighted assets of 4.5 percent and a CET1 capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets that applies to all U.S. banking organizations, including the Bank and the Company. Failure to maintain the capital conservation buffer would result in increasingly stringent restrictions on a banking organization's ability to make dividend payments and other capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.\nThe Company is also required to submit a periodic capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board under the CCAR process. The capital plan must include an assessment of the Company's expected uses and sources of capital over a forward-looking planning horizon of at least nine quarters, a detailed description of the Company's process for assessing capital adequacy, the Company's capital policy, and a discussion of any expected changes to the Company's business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy or liquidity. Based on a quantitative assessment, including a supervisory stress test conducted as part of the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve Board will either object to the Company's capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection to the Company. If the Federal Reserve Board objects to a capital plan, the Company may not make any capital distribution other than those with respect to which the Federal Reserve Board has indicated its non-objection. In addition to capital planning, the Company and the Bank are subject to capital stress testing requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe Federal Reserve Board evaluates the Company's liquidity as part of the supervisory process and adopted a final LCR rule. Failure to comply with these regulatory standards or any new rules, such as a final rule implementing NSFR, could affect the Company's business.\nIn addition, BBVA designated the Parent as its IHC to comply with the Federal Reserve Board's final rule to enhance its supervision and regulation of the U.S. operations of Large FBOs. The Parent is subject to U.S. risk-based and leverage capital, liquidity, risk management, stress testing and other enhanced prudential standards on a consolidated basis under this rule. BBVA's combined U.S. operations (including its U.S. branches, agencies and subsidiaries) are also subject to certain enhanced prudential standards. These enhanced prudential standards could affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nPlease refer to Item 1. Business - Supervision, Regulation and Other Factors for more information.\nThe Parent is a holding company and depends on its subsidiaries for liquidity in the form of dividends, distributions and other payments.\nThe Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, including the Bank. The principal source of cash flow for the Parent is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank. Regulations of both the Federal Reserve and the State of Alabama affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other distributions to the Company and to make loans to the Company. Also, the Company\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors. Limitations on the Parent\u2019s ability to receive dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and on its ability to pay dividends on common stock. For additional information regarding these limitations see Item 1. Business - Supervision, Regulation and Other Factors - Dividends.\nDisruptions in the Company's ability to access capital markets may adversely affect its capital resources and liquidity.\nThe Company may access capital markets to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs, and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of its clients. Other sources of contingent funding available to the Company include inter-bank borrowings, brokered deposits, repurchase agreements, FHLB capacity and borrowings from the Federal Reserve discount window. Any occurrence that may limit the Company's access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt investors, its depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of its debt rating, may adversely affect the Company's capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity.\nDisruptions in the liquidity of financial markets may directly impact the Company to the extent it needs to access capital markets to raise funds to support its business and overall liquidity position. This situation could adversely affect the cost of such funds or the Company's ability to raise such funds. If the Company were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, it might be unable to meet customers' needs, which could adversely impact its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and level of regulatory-qualifying capital.\nThe value of the Company\u2019s goodwill may decline in the future.\nA significant decline in the Company\u2019s expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, or slower growth rates, any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein, may require that the Company take charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill. Future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment. If the Company were to conclude that a future write-down of its goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, the Company would record the appropriate charge which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\nThe Company depends on the expertise of key personnel, and its operations may suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nThe Company's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that the Company serves is great and it may not be able to hire these candidates and retain them. If the Company is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations and financial condition.\nIn June 2010, the federal banking regulators issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization's incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules affecting the structure and reporting of incentive compensation. The federal banking regulators and SEC proposed such rules in 2011 and issued revised proposed rules in 2016.\nAs a wholly owned subsidiary of BBVA, the Company is also required to comply with the European Union\u2019s CRD-IV, which, among other things, impacts the variable compensation of certain risk-takers and highly compensated individuals in the Company or its subsidiaries. In accordance with CRD-IV, the Bank pays variable compensation of certain employees half in stock and half in cash. Additionally, in accordance with CRD-IV, from 40% to 50% (depending on the classification of the employee), of such payment is deferred for three years. The deferred amounts are subject to performance indicators and a malus clause, which could result in the reduction or forfeiture of the deferred amounts.\nThe equity awards are subject to an additional one-year holding period after delivery. Most of the Company\u2019s competitors are not subject to CRD-IV.\nIf the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more expensive, the Company's performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.\nUnpredictable catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, terrorist attacks and other large scale catastrophes could adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The Company has operations and customers in the southern United States, which could be adversely impacted by hurricanes and other severe weather in those regions. Unpredictable natural and other disasters could have an adverse effect on the Company in that such events could materially disrupt its operations or the ability or willingness of its customers to access the financial services it offers. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Although the Company carries insurance to mitigate its exposure to certain catastrophic events, these events could nevertheless reduce its earnings and cause volatility in its financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and/or results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nThe entities that set accounting standards and other regulatory bodies periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes can materially impact how management records and reports the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised accounting standard retroactively, resulting in a possible restatement of prior period financial statements.", "PERMNO": 22032, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BBVA1"}
