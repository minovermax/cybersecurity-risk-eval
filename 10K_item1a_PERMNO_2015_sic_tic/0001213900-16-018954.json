RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected as a result of any of the following risks. The value of our securities could decline as a result of any of these risks. You could lose all or part of your investment in our securities. Some of the statements in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d are forward-looking statements. The following risk factors are not the only risk factors facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe continue and expect to incur losses in the future.\nSuccessful completion of our development programs and our transition to normal operations are dependent upon obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA prior to selling our products within the United States, and foreign regulatory approvals must be obtained to sell our products internationally. There can be no assurance that we will receive regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, and a substantial amount of time may pass before we achieve a level of revenues adequate to support our operations. We also expect to incur substantial expenditures in connection with the regulatory approval process for each of our product candidates during their respective developmental periods. Obtaining marketing approval will be directly dependent on our ability to implement the necessary regulatory steps required to obtain marketing approval in the United States and in other countries. We cannot predict the outcome of these activities.\nBased on our current cash resources and commitments, we believe we will be able to maintain our current planned development activities and the corresponding level of expenditures for at least the next 12 months and beyond, although no assurance can be given that we will not need additional funds prior to such time. If there are unexpected increases in our operating expenses, we may need to seek additional financing during the next 12 months.\nWe will need substantial additional capital in order to satisfy our business objectives.\nTo date, we have financed our operations principally through offerings of securities exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. We believe that our available resources and cash flow will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital needs for at least the next 12 months from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will require substantial additional financing at various intervals in order to continue our research and development programs, including significant requirements for operating expenses including intellectual property protection and enforcement, for pursuit of regulatory approvals, and for commercialization of our products. We can provide no assurance that additional funding will be available on a timely basis, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In the event that we are unable to obtain such financing, we will not be able to fully develop and commercialize our technology. Our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including:\n\u25cf Continued scientific progress in our research and development programs,\n\u25cf Costs and timing of conducting clinical trials and seeking regulatory approvals and patent prosecutions,\n\u25cf Competing technological and market developments,\n\u25cf Our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships, and\n\u25cf Effects of commercialization activities and facility expansions if and as required.\nIf we cannot secure adequate financing when needed, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs or to enter into license or other arrangements with third parties to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves and commercialize ourselves. In such event, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected as we may be required to scale-back, eliminate, or delay development efforts or product introductions or enter into royalty, sales or other agreements with third parties in order to commercialize our products.\nWe have a history of losses and can provide no assurance as to our future operating results.\nWe do not have sufficient revenues from our research and development activities to fully support our operations. Consequently, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows since inception. We currently have only licensing revenues and no product revenues, and may not succeed in developing or commercializing any products which could generate product revenues. We do not expect to have any products on the market for several years. In addition, development of our product candidates requires a process of pre-clinical and clinical testing, during which our products could fail. We may not be able to enter into agreements with one or more companies experienced in the manufacturing and marketing of therapeutic drugs and, to the extent that we are unable to do so, we will not be able to market our product candidates. Eventual profitability will depend on our success in developing, manufacturing, and marketing our product candidates. As of August 31, 2016, August 31, 2015 and August 31, 2014, we had working capital of $27,609,000, $15,883,000 and $20,805,000, respectively, and stockholders\u2019 equity of $26,190,000, $24,828,000 and $20,793,000, respectively. During the 12 month period ended August 31, 2016, we generated revenues of $641,000. No revenues were generated in prior periods. For the period from our inception on April 12, 2002 through August 31, 2016, the year ended August 31, 2016, the year ended August 31, 2015 and the year ended August 31, 2014, we incurred net losses of $46,016,000, $10,964,000, $7,232,000 and $5,696,000, respectively. We may never achieve profitability and expect to incur net losses in the foreseeable future. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe rely upon patents to protect our technology.\nThe patent position of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology firms is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. We do not know whether any of our current or future patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Even issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Patents may not provide a competitive advantage or afford protection against competitors with similar technology. Competitors or potential competitors may have filed applications for, or may have received patents and may obtain additional and proprietary rights to compounds or processes used by or competitive with ours. In addition, laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nPatent litigation is becoming widespread in the biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and we cannot predict how this will affect our efforts to form strategic alliances, conduct clinical testing or manufacture and market any products under development. If challenged, our patents may not be held valid. We could also become involved in interference proceedings in connection with one or more of our patents or patent applications to determine priority of invention. If we become involved in any litigation, interference or other administrative proceedings, we will likely incur substantial expenses and the efforts of our technical and management personnel will be significantly diverted. In addition, an adverse determination could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. We may be restricted or prevented from manufacturing and selling our products in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and we may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies. We currently hold several pending patent applications in the United States for our technologies covering oral administration of insulin and other proteins and oral administration of exenatide and proteins, corresponding patent applications filed in Canada, Europe, Japan, China, Brazil, Hong Kong and India, 30 patents issued by the United States, Australian, Canadian, Chinese, Israeli, Japanese, New Zealand, South African, Russian, Hong Kong, Swiss, German, Spanish, French, United Kingdom, Italy, Indian and the Netherlands (for our technologies covering oral administration of insulin and other proteins) and New Zealand, South African, Australian, Russian and Israeli (for our technologies covering oral administration of insulin and other proteins and oral administration of exenatides) patent offices. Further, we intend to rely on a combination of trade secrets and non-disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our rights in our technology. We intend to depend upon confidentiality agreements with our officers, directors, employees, consultants, and subcontractors, as well as collaborative partners, to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology. These measures may not afford us sufficient or complete protection, and others may independently develop technology similar to ours, otherwise avoid our confidentiality agreements, or produce patents that would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. We believe that our technology is not subject to any infringement actions based upon the patents of any third parties; however, our technology may in the future be found to infringe upon the rights of others. Others may assert infringement claims against us, and if we should be found to infringe upon their patents, or otherwise impermissibly utilize their intellectual property, our ability to continue to use our technology could be materially restricted or prohibited. If this event occurs, we may be required to obtain licenses from the holders of this intellectual property, enter into royalty agreements, or redesign our products so as not to utilize this intellectual property, each of which may prove to be uneconomical or otherwise impossible. Licenses or royalty agreements required in order for us to use this technology may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. These claims could result in litigation, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur commercial success will also depend significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Patent applications are, in many cases, maintained in secrecy until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications are filed. In the event of infringement or violation of another party\u2019s patent, we may be prevented from pursuing product development or commercialization. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Description of Business-Patents and Licenses.\u201d\nAt present, our success depends primarily on the successful commercialization of our oral insulin capsule.\nThe successful commercialization of oral insulin capsule is crucial for our success. At present, our principal product is the oral insulin capsule. Our oral insulin capsule is in a clinical development stage and faces a variety of risks and uncertainties. Principally, these risks include the following:\n\u25cf Future clinical trial results may show that the oral insulin capsule is not well tolerated by recipients at its effective doses or is not efficacious as compared to placebo,\n\u25cf Future clinical trial results may be inconsistent with previous preliminary testing results and data from our earlier studies may be inconsistent with clinical data,\n\u25cf Even if our oral insulin capsule is shown to be safe and effective for its intended purposes, we may face significant or unforeseen difficulties in obtaining or manufacturing sufficient quantities or at reasonable prices,\n\u25cf Our ability to complete the development and commercialization of the oral insulin capsule for our intended use is significantly dependent upon our ability to obtain and maintain experienced and committed partners to assist us with obtaining clinical and regulatory approvals for, and the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of, the oral insulin capsule on a worldwide basis,\n\u25cf Even if our oral insulin capsule is successfully developed, commercially produced and receives all necessary regulatory approvals, there is no guarantee that there will be market acceptance of our product, and\n\u25cf Our competitors may develop therapeutics or other treatments which are superior or less costly than our own with the result that our products, even if they are successfully developed, manufactured and approved, may not generate significant revenues.\nIf we are unsuccessful in dealing with any of these risks, or if we are unable to successfully commercialize our oral insulin capsule for some other reason, it would likely seriously harm our business.\nWe have limited experience in conducting clinical trials.\nClinical trials must meet FDA and foreign regulatory requirements. We have limited experience in designing, conducting and managing the preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in any country. We have entered into agreements with Integrium LLC to assist us in designing, conducting and managing our various clinical trials in the United States. Any failure of Integrium or any other consultant to fulfill their obligations could result in significant additional costs as well as delays in designing, consulting and completing clinical trials on our products.\nOur clinical trials may encounter delays, suspensions or other problems.\nWe may encounter problems in clinical trials that may cause us or the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to delay, suspend or terminate our clinical trials at any phase. These problems could include the possibility that we may not be able to conduct clinical trials at our preferred sites, enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials at one or more sites or begin or successfully complete clinical trials in a timely fashion, if at all. Furthermore, we, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe the subjects participating in the trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or if we or they find deficiencies in the clinical trial process or conduct of the investigation. If clinical trials of any of the product candidates fail, we will not be able to market the product candidate which is the subject of the failed clinical trials. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies could also require additional clinical trials, which would result in increased costs and significant development delays. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a pharmaceutical product candidate under development could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidate and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe can provide no assurance that our products will obtain regulatory approval or that the results of clinical studies will be favorable.\nThe testing, marketing and manufacturing of any of our products will require the approval of the FDA or regulatory agencies of other countries. We have completed certain non-FDA clinical trials and pre-clinical trials for our products. In addition, we have completed a Phase IIb clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes under an IND with the FDA and we have completed Phase IIa clinical trials of ORMD-0801 in patients with type 1 diabetes under an IND with the FDA. However, success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. For example, a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials.\nWe cannot predict with any certainty the amount of time necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including from the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities, and whether any such approvals will ultimately be granted. In any event, review and approval by the regulatory bodies is anticipated to take a number of years. Preclinical and clinical trials may reveal that one or more of our products are ineffective or unsafe, in which event further development of such products could be seriously delayed or terminated. Moreover, obtaining approval for certain products may require the testing on human subjects of substances whose effects on humans are not fully understood or documented. Delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals of any proposed product and failure to receive such approvals would have an adverse effect on the product\u2019s potential commercial success and on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that a product may be found to be ineffective or unsafe due to conditions or facts which arise after development has been completed and regulatory approvals have been obtained. In this event we may be required to withdraw such product from the market. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Description of Business-Government Regulation.\u201d\nWe are dependent upon third party suppliers of our raw materials.\nWe are dependent on outside vendors for our entire supply of the oral insulin and GLP-1 capsules and do not currently have any long-term agreements in place for the supply of oral insulin or GLP-1 capsules. While we believe that there are numerous sources of supply available, if the third party suppliers were to cease production or otherwise fail to supply us with quality raw materials in sufficient quantities on a timely basis and we were unable to contract on acceptable terms for these services with alternative suppliers, our ability to produce our products and to conduct testing and clinical trials would be materially adversely affected.\nOur future revenues from HTIT are dependent upon third party suppliers and Chinese regulatory approvals.\nOur future revenues from HTIT are dependent upon the achievement of certain milestones and conditions, and the success of HTIT to implement our technology and to manufacture the oral insulin capsule. Our future revenues from HTIT are also dependent upon the ability of third parties to scale-up one of our oral capsule ingredients and to scale-up the manufacturing process of our capsules. Our future revenues from royalties from HTIT are further dependent upon the granting of regulatory approvals in the Territory. Accordingly, if any of the foregoing does not occur, we may not be successful in receiving future revenues from HTIT and may not succeed with our business plans in China.\nWe are highly dependent upon our ability to enter into agreements with collaborative partners to develop, commercialize, and market our products.\nOur long-term strategy is to ultimately seek a strategic commercial partner, or partners, such as large pharmaceutical companies, with extensive experience in the development, commercialization, and marketing of insulin applications and/or other orally digestible drugs. We anticipate such partner or partners would be responsible for, or substantially support, late stage clinical trials (Phase III) and sales and marketing of our oral insulin capsule and other products. Such planned strategic partnership, or partnerships, may provide a marketing and sales infrastructure for our products as well as financial and operational support for global clinical trials, post marketing studies, label expansions and other regulatory requirements concerning future clinical development in the United States and elsewhere.\nWhile our strategy is to partner with an appropriate party, no assurance can be given that any third party would be interested in partnering with us. We currently lack the resources to manufacture any of our product candidates on a large scale and we have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. In the event we are not able to enter into a collaborative agreement with a partner or partners, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may be unable to commercialize our products, which would have a material adverse effect upon our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological developments and a high degree of competition. We may be unable to compete with more substantial enterprises.\nThe biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological developments and a high degree of competition. As a result, our products could become obsolete before we recoup any portion of our related research and development and commercialization expenses. These industries are highly competitive, and this competition comes both from biotechnology firms and from major pharmaceutical and chemical companies. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, and human resources than we do (including, in some cases, substantially greater experience in clinical testing, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products). We also experience competition in the development of our products from universities and other research institutions and compete with others in acquiring technology from such universities and institutions. In addition, certain of our products may be subject to competition from products developed using other technologies. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Description of Business-Competition.\u201d\nWe have limited senior management resources and may be required to obtain more resources to manage our growth.\nWe expect the expansion of our business to place a significant strain on our limited managerial, operational, and financial resources. We will be required to expand our operational and financial systems significantly and to expand, train, and manage our work force in order to manage the expansion of our operations. Our failure to fully integrate our new employees into our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. Our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel is critical to our operations and expansion. We face competition for these types of personnel from other technology companies and more established organizations, many of which have significantly larger operations and greater financial, technical, human, and other resources than we have. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining these personnel, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d \u201cItem 1. Business-Description of Business-Strategy\u201d and \u201c-Employees.\u201d\nWe depend upon our senior management and skilled personnel and their loss or unavailability could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe currently depend upon the efforts and abilities of our senior executives, as well as the services of several key consultants and other key personnel, including Dr. Miriam Kidron, our Chief Medical and Technology Officer. The loss or unavailability of the services of any of these individuals for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance policies for any of our senior executives. In addition, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform future research and development work will be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of employees with expertise in developing, manufacturing and commercialization of products and related clinical and regulatory affairs, and this shortage is likely to continue. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and turnover rates are high. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel may be limited. Our inability to attract and retain qualified skilled personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nHealthcare policy changes, including pending legislation recently adopted and further proposals still pending to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may harm our future business.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. There have been and continue to be proposals by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to keep these costs down. Certain proposals, if passed, would impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for the products that we are developing, or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental agencies or third-party payors. These limitations could in turn reduce the amount of revenues that we will be able to generate in the future from sales of our products and licenses of our technology.\nIn March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted and President Obama signed into law healthcare reform legislation that has significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. In addition to requiring most individuals to have health insurance and establishing new regulations on health plans, this legislation requires discounts under the Medicare drug benefit program and increased rebates on drugs covered by Medicaid. In addition, the legislation imposes an annual fee, which has increased annually, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be materially adversely affected by these increased rebates, fees and other provisions. In addition, it appears likely that these and other ongoing initiatives in the United States will continue the pressure on drug pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and may also increase regulatory burdens and operating costs. The announcement or adoption of any such initiative could have an adverse effect on potential revenues from any product that we may successfully develop.\nVarious healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. We cannot predict what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. However, an expansion in government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may lower the future revenues for the products we are developing and adversely affect our future business, possibly materially.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nA considerable amount of our expenses are generated in dollars or in dollar-linked currencies, but a significant portion of our expenses such as some clinical studies and payroll costs are generated in other currencies such as NIS, Euro and British pounds. Most of the time, our non-dollar assets are not totally offset by non-dollar liabilities. Due to the foregoing and to the fact that our financial results are measured in dollars, our results could be adversely affected as a result of a strengthening or weakening of the dollar compared to these other currencies. During fiscal 2013 and 2014, the dollar depreciated in relation to the NIS, which raised the dollar cost of our Israeli based operations and adversely affected our financial results, while during fiscal 2012, 2015 and 2016 the dollar increased in relation to the NIS, which reduced the dollar cost of our Israeli based operations costs. In addition, our results could also be adversely affected if we are unable to guard against currency fluctuations in the future. Although we may in the future decide to undertake foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure, we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks. These transactions, however, may not adequately protect us from future currency fluctuations and, even if they do protect us, may involve operational or financing costs we would not otherwise incur.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nAs the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, this may make it difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.\nThe price of our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, and constantly changes. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. These fluctuations may result from a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf Clinical trial results and the timing of the release of such results,\n\u25cf The amount of cash resources and our ability to obtain additional funding,\n\u25cf Announcements of research activities, business developments, technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors,\n\u25cf Entering into or terminating strategic relationships,\n\u25cf Changes in government regulation,\n\u25cf Departure of key personnel,\n\u25cf Disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights,\n\u25cf Changes in expense level,\n\u25cf Future sales of our equity or equity-related securities,\n\u25cf Public concern regarding the safety, efficacy or other aspects of the products or methodologies being developed,\n\u25cf Activities of various interest groups or organizations,\n\u25cf Media coverage, and\n\u25cf Status of the investment markets.\nFuture sales of common stock or the issuance of securities senior to our common stock or convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, our common stock could materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, and our ability to raise funds in new equity offerings.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or other equity-related securities. We anticipate that we will need to raise capital through offerings of equity and equity related securities. We can make no prediction as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock or equity-related securities, or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, will have on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur stockholders may experience significant dilution as a result of any additional financing using our equity securities.\nTo the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution.\nOur management will have significant flexibility in using the net proceeds of any offering of securities.\nWe intend generally to use the net proceeds from any offerings of our securities for expenses related to our clinical trials, research and product development activities, and for general corporate purposes, including general working capital purposes. Our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of any such offering. The actual amounts and timing of expenditures will vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash used in our operations and our research and development efforts. Management\u2019s failure to use these funds effectively would have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock and could make it more difficult and costly to raise funds in the future.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our existing stockholders could adversely affect our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. As of November 22, 2016, we had outstanding 13,264,189 shares of common stock, a large majority of which are freely tradable. Giving effect to the exercise in full of all of our outstanding warrants, options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, including those currently unexercisable or unvested, we would have outstanding 15,744,280 shares of common stock.\nOur issuance of warrants, options and RSUs to investors, employees and consultants may have a negative effect on the trading prices of our common stock as well as a dilutive effect.\nWe have issued and may continue to issue warrants, options, RSUs and convertible notes at, above or below the current market price. As of November 22, 2016, we had outstanding warrants and options exercisable for 2,196,626 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $7.65. We also had outstanding RSUs exercisable for 165,964 shares of common stock at no cost. In addition to the dilutive effect of a large number of shares of common stock and a low exercise price for the warrants and options, there is a potential that a large number of underlying shares of common stock may be sold in the open market at any given time, which could place downward pressure on the trading of our common stock.\nDelaware law could discourage a change in control, or an acquisition of us by a third party, even if the acquisition would be favorable to you, and thereby adversely affect existing stockholders.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our Company, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of stockholders. Delaware law imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with \u201cinterested stockholders.\u201d These provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of common stock over then current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nBecause we will not pay cash dividends, investors may have to sell shares of our common stock in order to realize their investment.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, for reinvestment in the development and expansion of our business. Any credit agreements which we may enter into with institutional lenders or otherwise may restrict our ability to pay dividends. Whether we pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and any other factors that our Board decides is relevant. See \u201cItem 5. Market Price for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\u201d\nBecause certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over actions requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of November 22, 2016, our directors, executive officers and principal affiliated stockholders beneficially own approximately 29.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock, excluding shares issuable upon the exercise of options, warrants and RSUs. As a result, these stockholders, should they act together, may have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, should they act together, may have the ability to control our management and affairs. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u25cf Delaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control,\n\u25cf Impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or\n\u25cf Discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nRisks Related to Conducting Business in Israel\nWe are affected by the political, economic, and military risks of locating our principal operations in Israel.\nOur operations are located in the State of Israel, and we are directly affected by political, economic, and security conditions in that country. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors and a state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. In addition, acts of terrorism, armed conflicts or political instability in the region could negatively affect local business conditions and harm our results of operations. We cannot predict the effect on the region of any diplomatic initiatives or political developments involving Israel or the Palestinians or other countries and territories in the Middle East. Recent political events, including political uprisings, social unrest and regime change, in various countries in the Middle East and North Africa have weakened the stability of those countries and territories, which could result in extremists coming to power. In addition, Iran has threatened to attack Israel and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. This situation has escalated in the past and may potentially escalate in the future to violent events which may affect Israel and us. Our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if major hostilities involving Israel should occur or if trade between Israel and its current trading partners is interrupted or curtailed.\nAll adult male permanent residents of Israel, unless exempt, may be required to perform military reserve duty annually. Additionally, all such residents are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances. Some of our officers, directors, and employees currently are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty. We can provide no assurance that such requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations in the future, particularly if emergency circumstances occur.\nBecause we received grants from the Israel Innovation Authority we are subject to ongoing restrictions.\nWe received royalty-bearing grants from the Israel Innovation Authority, or IIA (previously the Office of the Chief Scientist) of the Israeli Ministry of Economy & Industry, Trade and Labor, for research and development programs that meet specified criteria. We did not recognize any grants in the year ended August 31, 2016, and recognized grants in the amounts of $49,000 and $428,000 in the years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We do not expect to receive further grants from the IIA in the future. The terms of the IIA grants limit our ability to transfer know-how developed under an approved research and development program outside of Israel, regardless of whether the royalties were fully paid.\nIt may be difficult to enforce a U.S. judgment against us or our officers and directors and to assert U.S. securities laws claims in Israel.\nAlmost all of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States. As a result, service of process upon us, our Israeli subsidiary and our directors and officers, may be difficult to obtain within the United States. Furthermore, because the majority of our assets and investments, and most of our directors and officers are located outside the United States, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against us or any such officers or directors. Additionally, it may be difficult to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because Israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to such claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law.\nSubject to specified time limitations and legal procedures, under the rules of private international law currently prevailing in Israel, Israeli courts may enforce a U.S. judgment in a civil matter, including a judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws, as well as a monetary or compensatory judgment in a non-civil matter, provided that the following key conditions are met:\n\u25cf subject to limited exceptions, the judgment is final and non-appealable;\n\u25cf the judgment was given by a court competent under the laws of the state in which the court is located and is otherwise enforceable in such state;\n\u25cf the judgment was rendered by a court competent under the rules of private international law applicable in Israel;\n\u25cf the laws of the state in which the judgment was given provides for the enforcement of judgments of Israeli courts;\n\u25cf adequate service of process has been effected and the defendant has had a reasonable opportunity to present his arguments and evidence;\n\u25cf the judgment and its enforcement are not contrary to the law, public policy, security or sovereignty of the State of Israel;\n\u25cf the judgment was not obtained by fraud and does not conflict with any other valid judgment in the same matter between the same parties; and\n\u25cf an action between the same parties in the same matter was not pending in any Israeli court at the time the lawsuit was instituted in the U.S. court.\nIf any of these conditions are not met, Israeli courts will likely not enforce the applicable U.S. judgment.", "PERMNO": 13798, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ORMP"}
