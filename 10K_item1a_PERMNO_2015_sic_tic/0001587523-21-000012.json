Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will be achieved or accomplished. Many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated include those risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Knowles does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we may make or persons acting on our behalf may issue.\nYou should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes, in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other companies such as general economic, industry, and/or market conditions and growth rates; possible future terrorist threats or armed conflicts and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nFinancial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe effects on our operations due to the public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken to limit COVID-19's spread have negatively impacted our operations and financial results and future impacts are uncertain and difficult to predict, but may include:\n\u25e6The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business may extend well beyond the current health crisis and immediate related governmental action. Disruptions resulting from COVID-19 have caused some of our customers to take cost-cutting actions. As a result, we are experiencing lower demand for products, customer requests for potential payment deferrals, pricing concessions, delays of deliveries, and other contract modifications. In addition, shifts in consumer spending and market downturns due to pandemic fears and the measures taken to contain its spread have negatively impacted demand for our products, primarily in our Audio segment, and may continue to have a significant negative impact to our markets.\n\u25e6We may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions, and other actions and restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. For example, we experienced a temporary reduction of our manufacturing and operating capacity in China, Malaysia, and the Philippines as a result of government-mandated actions to control the spread of COVID-19. While those restrictions have been lifted, they may be reinstated as the pandemic continues to evolve. In addition, our U.S. facilities have been designated as an essential business in jurisdictions where facility closures have been mandated, but we can give no assurance that this will not change in the future or that our business will continue to be classified as essential in each of the U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\u25e6To date we have not experienced significant disruption to our supply chain. However, if our suppliers' operations were to be impacted, we may need to seek alternative suppliers, which may result in higher supply chain costs to us, supplies not being available, or delays in shipments to us and subsequently to our customers.\n\u25e6We have experienced increased costs resulting from efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 through social distancing measures (such as limiting or reducing the number of workers at our sites), as well as incremental costs associated with enhanced cleaning measures and providing workers with personal protection equipment.\n\u25e6The Company believes that our future cash flow from operations and access to capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our future working capital needs, capital expenditures, and strategic investments. However, the uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effect on our product markets, pose heightened risks to our liquidity.\nThese and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors disclosed herein. The ultimate impact on our business and results of operations depends on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nOur largest segment, Audio, derives a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of OEM customers. If revenues derived from these customers decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur Audio segment accounted for 77% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2020. Our Audio segment derives a significant portion of revenues from a small number of OEM customers. For 2020, Audio top five customers accounted for approximately 52% of Audio\u2019s revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Apple Inc. accounted for approximately 29% of Audio\u2019s revenues and 23% of consolidated company revenues. The mobile handset industry is also subject to intense competition that could result in decreased demand and/or declining average selling prices for our products and those of our OEM customers. The loss of any one of Audio\u2019s top customers or a reduction in the purchases of Audio\u2019s products by such customers would reduce our total revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, and any delay of a significant volume of purchases by any one of our top customers, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Further, concentration of market share among a few companies and the corresponding increase in purchasing power of these companies may result in lower prices for our products which, if not offset by a sufficient increase in the volume, or favorable changes in the mix, of purchases of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing, volume, and mix of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers\u2019 new or next generation product introductions, and the timing of such introductions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Accordingly, if current market and industry dynamics continue, our Audio segment\u2019s revenues will continue to depend largely upon, and be impacted by the timing, volume, and mix of future purchases by a limited number of our OEM customers.\nWe derive the majority of our Audio revenues from MEMS microphones and a significant reduction in our sales of MEMS microphones could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely impact our operating results.\nWithin our Audio segment, revenues are generated primarily from the sales of our MEMS microphones. Sales of MEMS microphones accounted for approximately 59% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2020. We expect that a substantial portion of our revenues will continue to be attributable to sales of MEMS microphones and any weakening of demand, loss of market share, or other factors adversely affecting our levels and the timing of our sales of MEMS microphones, including our customers\u2019 product release cycles, market acceptance, product competition, the performance and reliability of our MEMS microphones, and economic and market conditions could cause our Audio revenues to substantially decline, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe depend on the mobile handset market for a significant portion of our revenues, and any downturn or slower than expected growth in this market could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely impact our operating results.\nThe mobile handset market accounted for approximately 28% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2020. While other markets such as mobile headsets, wearables, and IoT are gaining in significance, we expect that a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues will continue to be attributable to the mobile handset market, which is cyclical and characterized by continuous and rapid technological change, product obsolescence, price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles, and significant fluctuations in product supply and demand. Moreover, the mobile handset market may not continue to grow at the rate experienced in recent years or may decline for reasons outside of our control including competition among market participants, market saturation, and global economic conditions. The mobile handset market has experienced and may experience periodic downturns which may be characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels, and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Given that the strength of the mobile handset market is a primary driver of revenues for our Audio segment, any downturn in the mobile handset market could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, a decline in global economic conditions, particularly in China and other geographic regions with high concentrations of mobile handset users, could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on demand for our products or technologies, the products and services of our customers or licensees, particularly OEM handset manufacturers, the solvency of key suppliers, failures by counterparties, and negative effects on mobile handset inventories. In addition, our customers\u2019 ability to purchase or pay for our products and services and their customers\u2019 ability to upgrade their mobile handsets could be adversely affected by economic conditions, leading to a reduction, cancellation, or delay of orders for our products or services.\nIf we are unable to offset erosion of average selling prices in our Audio segment our gross margins may be adversely affected.\nLike most technology sectors, the mobile handset industry has traditionally experienced an erosion of average selling prices due to a number of factors, including intense competition, component pricing trends, changes in demand mix, excess inventories, and rapid obsolescence resulting from technology advances. Within our Audio segment, while average selling prices vary significantly on a product to product basis, we have traditionally been successful with largely offsetting price erosion by shifting our product mix to new, higher end or higher performance microphones and gradually shifting customers from analog microphones to higher value digital microphones. To offset average selling price erosion, we must either continue to be successful with these initiatives or increase our selling prices. If we are unable to offset average selling price erosion, the average selling prices of our products may decrease and our future operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on highly specialized suppliers for a variety of highly engineered or specialized components, and other inputs for which we may not be able to readily identify alternatives or substitutes in the event of a supply disruption or capacity constraint at or by any of these suppliers, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nCertain of our businesses rely on highly specialized suppliers or foundries for critical materials, components, or subassemblies that are used in our products. In some cases, such suppliers or foundries may be our sole source of supply or, such suppliers or foundries may also be a strategic supplier to one of our competitors or a customer. In either of these cases, should an event occur which affects the ability or willingness of any of such supplier or foundry to continue to deliver materials or components to us in a timely manner, we may not be able to identify or qualify an alternative supplier in a timely manner which, in any such period and future periods, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Potential events or occurrences which could cause business or supply disruptions or affect the ability or willingness of a supplier or foundry to continue to supply us include changes in market strategy, the acquisition of, sale, or other change in control or ownership structure of a supplier or foundry, strategic divestiture, bankruptcy, insolvency or other financial difficulties, business disruptions, operational issues, or capacity constraints at a supplier or foundry.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, and if we are unable to attract and retain such qualified employees, our business and our ability to execute our business strategies may be materially impaired.\nOur future success depends largely on the continued service and efforts of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain, and motivate them, particularly in an environment of cost reductions and a general move toward more performance-based compensation for executives and key management.\nImplementing our business strategy also requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. Competition for such experienced technical personnel in our industry and where we are located is intense, and we cannot assure that we can continue to recruit and retain such personnel. For example, there is substantial competition in China for experienced engineers and technical personnel where most of our operations are located and for machine learning and software engineers in California and India where we primarily conduct research and development for our software and intelligent audio products, which may make it difficult for us to recruit and retain key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain such qualified employees, our business and our ability to execute our business strategies may be materially impaired.\nWe have invested and continue to make strategic investments and acquisitions that, if not successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe engage in strategic transactions and make strategic investments including investments in emerging technology companies and intellectual property which are focused on growth by positioning the Company for expansion into new markets, territories or technologies, exploiting new or growing customer or market opportunities, and developing new technologies and products. Such acquisitions and strategic investments naturally entail significant risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. We may not, for example, be able to retain key employees, customers, or suppliers of acquired companies, derive value from acquired technology or assets and we may experience delays in achieving cost synergies or higher than expected costs in implementing them. In addition, due to our inexperience with certain adjacent or complimentary technologies and doing business in certain geographic regions that may be served by acquired businesses, we may underestimate the costs or overestimate the benefits that we expect to realize from such acquisitions or investments, and we may not achieve them. We cannot, therefore, provide assurance that each of our acquisitions or strategic investments will be accretive or generate anticipated financial returns. If, for any of these or for unforeseen reasons, our strategic acquisitions or investments fail to meet our expectations or forecasts, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate which will impact our future financial results.\nOur effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of our worldwide earnings as we are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations governing each region, changes to those regulations, differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, tax law, or rate changes could adversely affect our effective tax rate, and ultimately actual taxes payable.\nThe estimated effects of applicable tax laws, including current interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform Act\"), have been incorporated into our financial results. The U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue future legislation or guidance which impact how provisions of the Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation, which could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate as well as our future financial results and tax payments.\nFurther, our tax returns are subject to periodic reviews or audits by domestic and international authorities, and these audits may result in adjustments to our provision for taxes or allocations of income or deductions that result in tax assessments different from amounts that we have estimated. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these audits to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these audits or that our tax provisions will not change materially or be adequate to satisfy any associated tax liability. If our effective tax rates were to increase or if our tax liabilities exceed our estimates and provisions for such taxes, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur effective tax rate is favorably impacted by tax holidays granted to us by certain foreign jurisdictions, which lowers the tax rates we are subject to for a period of time as compared to the countries' statutory tax rates. These tax holidays are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including exceeding certain annual thresholds of operating expenses and gross sales. If we fail to satisfy such conditions, our effective tax rate may be materially adversely impacted. For additional detail, see Note 13. Income Taxes to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Moreover, tax rates and laws in the countries where we operate may change, or tax reforms may be enacted domestically or in foreign jurisdictions which adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows, and future reported financial results or our ability to continue to structure and conduct our business as is done currently.\nOur products are complex and could contain defects, which could result in material costs to us and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur products are complex and could contain defects, which could result in material costs to us. Product development in the markets we serve is becoming more focused on audio signal processing for improved audio performance and to enable intelligent and more sophisticated audio solutions. The increasing complexity of our products increases the risk that we or our customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults after significant volumes of product have been shipped. This could result in material costs and other adverse consequences to us including, but not limited to: loss of customers, reduced margins, damage to our reputation, a material product recall, replacement costs for product warranty and support, payments to our customers related to recall claims as a result of various industry or business practices, a delay in recognition or loss of revenues, loss of market share, or failure to achieve market acceptance, and a diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, any defects or other problems with our products could result in financial losses or other damages to our customers who could seek damages from us for their losses. A product liability or warranty claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly to defend. In particular, the sale of systems and components that are incorporated into mobile handsets for the global mobile phone industry involves a high degree of risk that such claims may be made. Due to the complex nature of our products, quality and reliability issues may be identified after significant volumes of a product have been shipped to a large customer. A warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves, or a determination that we have liability or an obligation to cover the costs of a customer product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, our products are typically sold to customers at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the customer\u2019s products in which they are incorporated. Given that a defect in one of our products could give rise to failures in the products that incorporate them, we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues we receive from the products involved and because we are self-insured for matters relating to product quality a significant claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Moreover, to the extent a defect in one of our products is caused by a defective component supplied to us by a third party, we may, nonetheless, be liable to the customer and be unsuccessful in seeking indemnification from that third party.\nOur goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets may become impaired, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.\nWe hold significant amounts of goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets, and the balances of these assets could increase in the future if we acquire other businesses. At December 31, 2020, the balance of our goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets was $1.2 billion and the total market value of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares was $1.7 billion. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"), we review our goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets may not be recoverable. In addition, we test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a sustained decline in stock price and market capitalization, significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results, reduced future cash flow estimates, adverse changes in legal factors, failure to realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets is determined to exist, negatively impacting our results of operations. If our market capitalization was to fall below the book value of our total stockholders\u2019 equity for a sustained period, we may conclude that the fair value of certain of our intangible or long-lived assets is materially impaired. In this case, we would be required under U.S. GAAP to record a non-cash charge to our earnings which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to potentially material liability for breaches of confidentiality agreements with certain of our top customers.\nWe have entered into non-disclosure agreements with several of our top customers which require us not to disclose and to protect certain information regarding, among other things, aspects of those customers\u2019 businesses plans, products, and technology. These confidentiality agreements, in some cases, impose strict liability on us in the event of any breach of these agreements by us or our employees or agents and, should such a breach occur, any resulting damage award or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nGlobal markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If we are unable to develop new products and compete effectively in these markets, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe compete in highly competitive, technology-based, industries that are highly dynamic as new technologies are developed and introduced. Our competitors may introduce products that are as or more technologically advanced than our products or launch new products faster than we can, which may result in a loss of market share or revenue by us. If we are unable to anticipate or match our competitors\u2019 development or launch of new products, identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully launch or ramp production of our new products, our business and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe operate in the highly competitive mobile handset industry, which requires us to invest significant capital in developing, qualifying, and ramping production of new products without any assurance of product sales. If our new products are not designed into a customer's product or qualified by a customer our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nA significant portion of our consolidated revenues are derived from acoustic components and audio solutions that are required to go through extensive customer qualification processes before being selected by customers for inclusion in their end products. In order to meet the product launch schedules of our top customers, we may invest capital and devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing, and programming efforts, based on non-binding forecasts provided by these customers, without any assurance that our products will be designed into a customer\u2019s product or qualified by the customer. In such cases, if our product is not designed into or qualified by the customer, we may not recover or realize any return on the capital that we invested and our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, the time required and costs incurred by us to ramp-up production for new products can be significant. Certain non-recurring costs and expenditures for tooling and other equipment may not be reusable in manufacturing products for other customers or different products for the same customer. Product ramps typically involve greater volumes of scrap and risks to execution such as higher costs due to inefficiencies and delays in production, all of which can have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Operating a Global Business\nOur foreign operations and supply chain are each subject to various risks that could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our manufacturing operations, research and development operations, vendors, and suppliers are located outside the United States and if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global operations, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. These risks include:\no labor unrest and strikes, particularly in Asia, where the majority of our manufacturing operations are located;\no earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters, pandemics (such as the coronavirus), or catastrophic events, particularly in Asia, where the majority of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located;\no acts of terrorism or armed conflicts;\no political or economic instability;\no government embargoes, trade restrictions, and import and export controls; and\no transportation delays and interruptions.\nGlobal economic conditions and changes in U.S. and international trade policy could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nIn the past, the Company's business and operating results have been adversely affected by these global economic conditions and remain vulnerable to future adverse impacts. Any prolonged economic deceleration in China may have a material adverse effect on our sales to customers in China, our operating results, and our financial condition.\nWe face uncertainty with respect to U.S. trade policy, due to the change in the U.S. presidential administration. The prior administration had taken certain actions and demonstrated its intent to alter its approach to international trade policy using many tactics at its disposal including the renegotiation, termination or threatened termination, or renegotiation of certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements and treaties with, the imposition of tariffs on a wide range of products and other goods manufactured in, China, countries in Europe, and other countries and the imposition of sanctions on countries and companies that it had concluded were directly or indirectly avoiding United States\u2019 trade sanctions or acting contrary to U.S. national security. Given that the majority of our largest manufacturing facilities are located in China and Southeast Asia, trade policy changes in the United States, China, or other countries, such as the tariffs and sanctions would present particular risks for us that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot predict future foreign trade policy in the United States or other countries, the terms of any new or renegotiated trade agreements or treaties, or tariffs or the impact of such matters on our business. A trade war involving the United States is likely to negatively impact world trade and the world economy in various ways and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. To the extent that tariffs, trade restrictions, or sanctions imposed by the United States or other countries increase the price of, affect customer demand for, affect our ability to supply our products, or create adverse tax consequences, in the United States or other countries, our business and our operating results may be adversely affected. As a result, changes in international trade policy, changes in trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs or sanctions by the United States or other countries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nChanges to export restrictions and economic sanction laws may adversely affect our operating results.\nAs a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including import, export, and economic sanction laws. These laws may include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons, and entities, may require an export license prior to the export of the controlled item, or may otherwise limit and restrict the export of certain products and technologies. Many of our customers and suppliers are foreign companies or have significant foreign operations. The imposition of new or additional economic and trade sanctions against our major customers or suppliers could result in our inability to sell to, and generate revenue from such customers or purchase materials from such suppliers. Although these restrictions and laws have not significantly restricted our operations in the past, there is a risk that they could do so in the future.\nFor example, on May 16, 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce published a final rule in the Federal Register that amended the Export Administration Regulations by adding Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (\"Huawei\") and 68 of its affiliates to the \u201cEntity List\u201d for actions contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the U.S. This rule imposed new export licensing requirements on exports, re-exports, and in-country transfers of all U.S.-regulated products, software, and technology to the designated Huawei entities. To date, this action has not had a material impact on our results of operations. However, if new or different restrictions are placed on sales of our products to our existing or potential customers, this could adversely affect our business and results of operations in the future.\nAs a result of restrictive export laws, our customers may also develop their own solutions to replace our products or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, our association with customers that are or become subject to U.S. regulatory scrutiny or export restrictions could subject us to actual or perceived reputational harm among current or prospective investors, suppliers or customers, customers of our customers, other parties doing business with us, or the general public. Any such reputational harm could result in the loss of investors, suppliers, or customers, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\nFluctuations in commodity prices and foreign currency rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe use a wide variety of raw materials in our manufacturing operation and are exposed to market risks associated with changes in commodity prices. Changes in commodity prices (from tariffs or otherwise) cannot always be predicted, hedged, or offset with price increases to eliminate earnings volatility. As a result, significant changes in commodity prices, particularly for various precious metals, could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we conduct a significant amount of business outside the United States and adverse movements in currency exchange rates, particularly the Malaysian ringgit, the Chinese renminbi (yuan), and the Philippine peso, in any period or periods, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our operating results due to a number of factors, including, among others:\no our products are manufactured and sold outside the United States which increases our net exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates;\no our products, which are typically sold in U.S. dollars, may become less price-competitive outside the United States as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange rates;\no certain of our revenues that are derived from customer sales denominated in foreign currencies could decrease;\no our foreign suppliers may raise their prices if they are impacted by currency fluctuations, resulting in higher than expected costs and lower margins;\no the cost of materials, products, services, and other expenses outside the United States could be materially impacted by a weakening of the U.S. dollar; and\no a sustained weakening of the U.S. dollar for an extended period could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial position.\nWhile we have entered and may in the future enter into derivative financial instruments in an effort to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we remain exposed to the economic risks of foreign currency fluctuations. See the \u201cRisk Management\u201d section of Item 7 for additional discussion of commodity price and foreign currency risks.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Cybersecurity\nOur revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights or if intellectual property litigation is successful against us.\nWe employ various measures to maintain, protect, and defend our intellectual property, including enforcing our intellectual property rights in various jurisdictions and forums throughout the world. However, policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies, and proprietary information is difficult and time consuming and these measures may not prevent our intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, copied, disclosed, stolen, or circumvented. If we fail to protect our proprietary rights, our competitors might gain access to our technology, which could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully in our markets and harm our operating results. We also may not be successful in litigation or other actions to enforce our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected, particularly in Asia, where the majority of our manufacturing operations are located. Litigation, if necessary, may result in retaliatory legal proceedings alleging infringement by us of intellectual property owned by others. We have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights, including collecting royalties for use of certain patents included in our patent portfolio in certain foreign jurisdictions due to, among other things: policies of foreign governments; challenges to our licensing practices under such jurisdictions\u2019 competition laws; failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and/or challenges pending before foreign patent authorities as to the validity of our patents and those owned by competitors and other parties.\nOur competitors or other third parties may also assert infringement or invalidity claims against us in the future. If one of our products is found to infringe on a third party\u2019s rights, we may have liability for damages arising out of past infringement and may need to seek a license to use such intellectual property going forward. If a license is not available or if we are unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, we would either have to change our product so that it does not infringe or cease selling the product. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe expense of protecting, defending, and enforcing our intellectual property, or defending claims that our products, technology, or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, can vary significantly period to period and, in any given period, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches, cybersecurity incident, other unauthorized disclosures, or network disruptions.\nWhile we have taken and continue to actively take measures to protect the various proprietary information, algorithms, source code, and confidential data relating to both our and our customers\u2019 business and products that is stored on our computer networks, servers, and peripheral devices, as well as on servers owned or managed by third party vendors whom we leverage, such data and information remains vulnerable to cyber attacks, cyber breaches, theft, or other unauthorized access. These attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity and are costly to protect against. In addition, many of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, including viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs, are difficult to anticipate until launched against a target and we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures. If successful, such unauthorized access could result in loss of valuable intellectual property, disclosure of confidential customer or commercial data, disclosure of government classified information, or system disruptions and subject us to civil liability and fines or penalties, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business, any of which could be material.\nShould any security breach result in the disclosure of certain of our customers\u2019 or business partners\u2019 confidential information, we may incur liability to such customers or business partners under confidentiality agreements that we are party to with such parties. In addition, delayed sales, lower margins, or lost customers resulting from security breaches or network disruptions could materially reduce our revenues, materially increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nThere is also a danger of industrial espionage, unauthorized disclosures, theft of information or assets (including source code), or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to the Company's facilities, systems, or information. Such breaches, misuse, or other disruptions could lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary information or improper usage or sale of the Company's products or intellectual property without compensation and theft, manipulation, and destruction of private and proprietary data, which could result in defective products, production downtimes, lost revenue, or damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nAdditionally, any disruption, termination, or substandard provision of our communication networks and IT systems, whether as a result of computer or telecommunication issues (including operational failures, computer viruses, or security breaches), localized conditions (such as power outage, fire, or explosion) or events or circumstances of broader geographic impact (such as earthquake, storm, flood, other natural disaster, epidemic, strike, act of war, civil unrest, or terrorist act), could materially affect our business by disrupting normal operations.\nGlobal privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex data privacy environment. We are subject to many data privacy, data protection, and data breach notification laws and regulations in the United States and around the world. While we have taken measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with data privacy legislation, there is the potential for fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in the event of a data breach.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains covenants requiring us to, among other things, maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and a maximum ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA. In the past, we have obtained amendments from the lenders under the credit agreement which have allowed us to comply with the financial covenants, but there can be no assurance that in the future the lenders will agree to such amendments, and our inability to comply with the covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.\nAs discussed in Note 12. Borrowings to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\", we issued convertible senior notes (the \"Notes\") and concurrently entered into convertible note hedge transactions and separate warrants. The option counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of the option counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any of the option counterparties become subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with such counterparties. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the option counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nThere are risks associated with our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have negative consequences, including:\no requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes;\no limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, or other general corporate and other purposes;\no limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\no increasing our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations to the extent a portion of our debt has variable interest rates.\nOur ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such financing, refinancing, or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such financing and/or refinancing are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such financing and/or refinancing would increase. Furthermore, our variable rate indebtedness may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness. If there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt in the future, and/or the terms of the financing could be adversely affected.\nTransactions relating to our Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of our outstanding Notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any such Notes. If the Notes become convertible under the terms of the indenture, and if holders subsequently elect to convert their notes, we could be required to deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions. Additionally, anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. For additional detail, see Note 12. Borrowings to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Governance and Common Stock\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist or hostile stockholders.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy, and impact the trading value of our securities. In the past, the Company has been the subject of shareholder activism, and we are subject to the risks associated with any future such activism. Stockholder activism, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors, potentially interfering with our ability to execute our strategic plan. Additionally, such stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely affect our relationships with key executives and business partners, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist stockholder matters. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Further, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by stockholder activism.\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation, by-laws, and Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nEach of our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and Delaware law, as currently in effect, contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\no the inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting or act by written consent;\no rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\no the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\no the classification of our Board of Directors and a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause, in each case until our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders; and\no the ability of our directors, without a stockholder vote, to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors (including those resulting from an enlargement of the Board of Directors).\nIn addition, current Delaware law includes provisions which limit the ability of persons that, without prior board approval, acquire more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation, or purchases of additional shares, for a three-year period following the acquisition by such persons of more than 15% of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nIn light of present circumstances, we believe these provisions taken as a whole protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers or prevent changes in the composition of our Board of Directors. However, these provisions could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of the Company and all of our stockholders.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and may fluctuate significantly which may adversely impact investor confidence and increase the likelihood of securities class action litigation.\nOur common stock price has experienced substantial volatility in the past and may remain volatile in the future. During 2020, our closing stock price ranged from a high of $22.05 per share to a low of $11.52 per share. Volatility in our stock price can be driven by many factors including divergence between our actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts or the expectations of the market, market conditions in our industry, announcements that we, our competitors, our vendors, or our customers may make regarding their operating results, technological innovations, and the gain or loss of customers, or key opportunities. Our common stock is also included in certain market indices, and any change in the composition of these indices to exclude our company may adversely affect our stock price. Increased volatility in the financial markets and/or overall economic conditions may reduce the amounts that we realize in the future on our cash equivalents and/or marketable securities and may reduce our earnings as a result of any impairment charges that we record to reduce recorded values of marketable securities to their fair values.\nFurther, securities class action litigation is often brought against a public company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Due to changes in our stock price, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management\u2019s attention and our resources.", "PERMNO": 14487, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "KN"}
