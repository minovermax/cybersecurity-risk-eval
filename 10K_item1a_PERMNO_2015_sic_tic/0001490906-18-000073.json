Risk Factors\nThere are risks inherent in the Bank's and Company's business. The following is a summary of material risks and uncertainties relating to the operations of the Bank and the Company. Adverse experiences with these could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Some of these risks and uncertainties are interrelated, and the occurrence of one or more of them may exacerbate the effect of others. These material risks and uncertainties are not necessarily presented in order of significance. In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this Annual Report, there may also be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities, cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and dividends received on FHLB stock, and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition because the majority of our interest-earning assets are long-term, fixed-rate loans, while the majority of our interest-bearing liabilities are shorter term, and therefore subject to a greater degree of interest rate fluctuations. This type of risk is known as interest rate risk and is affected by prevailing economic and competitive conditions, including monetary policies of the FRB and fiscal policies of the United States federal government.\nThe impact of changes in interest rates is generally observed on the income statement. The magnitude of the impact will be determined by the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, both of which either reprice or mature within a given period of time. This difference provides an indication of the extent to which our net interest rate spread will be impacted by changes in interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rates will impact the expected level of repricing of the Bank's mortgage-related assets and callable debt securities. Generally, as interest rates decline, the amount of interest-earning assets expected to reprice will increase as borrowers have an economic incentive to reduce the cost of their mortgage or debt, which would negatively impact the Bank's interest income. Conversely, as interest rates rise, the amount of interest-earning assets expected to reprice will decline as the economic incentive to refinance the mortgage or debt is diminished. As this occurs, the amount of interest-earning assets repricing could diminish to the point where interest-bearing liabilities reprice to a higher interest rate at a faster pace than interest-earning assets, thus negatively impacting the Bank's net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition as AFS securities are reported at estimated fair value. We increase or decrease our stockholders' equity, specifically AOCI (loss), by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of our AFS securities, net of deferred taxes. Increases in interest rates generally decrease the fair value of AFS securities. Decreases in the fair value of AFS securities would, therefore, adversely impact stockholders' equity.\nChanges in interest rates, as they relate to customers, can also have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In times of rising interest rates, default risk may increase among borrowers with adjustable-rate loans as the rates on their loans adjust upward and their payments increase. Fluctuations in interest rates also affect customer demand for deposit products. Local competition could affect our ability to attract deposits, or could result in us paying more than competitors for deposits.\nAs was announced in July 2017, LIBOR is anticipated to be phased out by the end of 2021. As of September 30, 2018, the Bank's loan portfolio included $831.1 million of adjustable-rate loans for which the repricing index was tied to LIBOR. Additionally, the Bank has interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $475.0 million tied to LIBOR. Our loan agreements generally allow the Bank to choose a new index based upon comparable information if the current index is no longer available. The use of a new index could reduce our interest income and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Management continues to monitor the status and discussions regarding LIBOR.\nIn addition to general changes in interest rates, changes that affect the shape of the yield curve could negatively impact the Bank. The Bank's interest-bearing liabilities are generally priced based on short-term interest rates while the majority of the Bank's interest-earning assets are priced based on long-term interest rates. Income for the Bank is primarily driven by the spread between these rates. As a result, a steeper yield curve, meaning long-term interest rates are significantly higher than short-term interest rates, would provide the Bank with a better opportunity to increase net interest income. When the yield curve is flat, meaning long-term interest rates and short-term interest rates are essentially the same, or when the yield curve is inverted, meaning long-term interest rates are lower than short-term interest rates, the yield between interest-earning assets\nand interest-bearing liabilities that reprice is compressed or diminished and would likely negatively impact the Bank's net interest income. See \"Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for additional information about the Bank's interest rate risk management.\nThe occurrence of any information system failure or interruption, breach of security or cyber-attack, at the Company, at its third-party service providers or counterparties may have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nInformation systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger, our deposits and our loans. In the normal course of our business, we collect, process, retain and transmit (by email and other electronic means) sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others. We also outsource certain aspects of our data processing, data processing operations, remote network monitoring, engineering and managed security services to third-party service providers. In addition to confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others, we, and in some cases a third party, compile, process, transmit and store proprietary, non-public information concerning our business, operations, plans and strategies.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions continue to increase in part because of evolving technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. Cyber criminals use a variety of tactics, such as ransomware, denial of service, and theft of sensitive business and customer information to extort payment or other concessions from victims. In some cases, these attacks have caused significant impacts on other businesses' access to data and ability to provide services. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all incidents of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources.\nWe use a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions and security breaches and to protect confidential information from mishandling, misuse or loss, including detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents. However, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be promptly detected and adequately addressed if they do, and early detection of security breaches may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection. If there is a failure in or breach of our information systems, or those of a third-party service provider, the confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, such information systems could potentially be jeopardized, or could otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers, employees, or others.\nOur business and operations depend on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our information systems and those of our third-party service providers. Although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our information systems through information security measures, risk management practices, relationships with threat intelligence providers and business continuity planning, our facilities, computer systems, software and networks, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have a security impact. In addition, breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our confidential or other information or the confidential or other information of our customers, employees or others. While we regularly conduct security and risk assessments on our systems and those of our third-party service providers, there can be no assurance that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach. The Company has not experienced any material breaches.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could subject us to litigation or regulatory scrutiny, cause us significant reputational damage or erode confidence in the security of our information systems, products and services, cause us to lose customers or have greater difficulty in attracting new customers, have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock or subject us to financial losses that may not be covered by insurance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance or modify our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks.\nFurthermore, there has recently been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy, data protection and information security. New or revised laws and regulations may significantly impact our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, the collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and employee information, and current or planned business activities. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur customers are also the target of cyber-attacks and identity theft. There have been several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. Large scale identity theft could result in customers' accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses. The occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAn economic downturn, especially one affecting our geographic market area and certain regions of the country where we have correspondent loans, could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nOur primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one- to four-family first mortgage loans on residential properties; therefore, we are particularly exposed to downturns in regional housing markets and, to a lesser extent, the U.S. housing market, along with changes in the levels of unemployment or underemployment. We monitor the current status and trends of local and national employment levels and trends and current conditions in the real estate and housing markets in our local market areas and certain areas where we have correspondent loans. Adverse conditions in our local economies and in certain areas where we have correspondent loans, such as inflation, unemployment, recession, natural disasters, or other factors beyond our control, could impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. Any one or a combination of these events may have an adverse impact on borrowers' ability to repay their loans, which could result in increased delinquencies, non-performing assets, loan losses, and future loan loss provisions. Decreases in local real estate values could adversely affect the value of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure.\nThe increase in commercial loans in our loan portfolio exposes us to increased lending and credit risks.\nA growing portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial loans. In addition, as a result of the acquisition of CCB, it is anticipated that commercial lending will continue to be a growing portion of our business. These loan types tend to be larger than and in different geographic regions from most of our existing loan portfolio and are generally considered to have different and greater risks than one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Furthermore, these loan types can expose us to a greater risk of delinquencies, non-performing assets, loan losses, and future loan loss provisions than one- to four-family residential real estate loans because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations of a business or of the underlying property. Repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower's control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market, the economy, environmental factors, natural disasters, and/or changes in government regulation. Also, there are risks inherent in commercial real estate construction lending as the value of the project is uncertain prior to the completion of construction and subsequent lease-up. A sudden downturn in the economy or other unforeseen events could result in stalled projects or collateral shortfalls, thus exposing us to increased credit risk. Additionally, a large portion of our commercial loans were originated/participated in during the past five fiscal years, which makes it difficult to assess the future performance of these loans because of the borrowers' relatively limited income history and loan payment history.\nOur recently acquired commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the collateral underlying the loans. The borrowers' cash flow may prove to be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most often, this collateral consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Significant adverse changes in a borrower's industries and businesses could cause rapid declines in values of, and collectability associated with, those business assets, which could result in inadequate collateral coverage for our commercial and industrial loans and expose us to future losses. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its clients. Inventory and equipment may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, may be illiquid and may\nfluctuate in value based on the success of the business. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. An increase in specific reserves and charge-offs related to our recently acquired commercial and industrial loan portfolio could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nOur commercial loans generally have significantly larger average loan balances compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans and may involve multiple loans to groups of related borrowers. Our largest commercial lending relationship was $50.0 million at September 30, 2018.\nA growing commercial loan portfolio subjects us to greater regulatory scrutiny. Regulatory agencies have observed that many commercial markets are experiencing substantial growth, and as a result, concentration levels of commercial loans have been rising at some institutions.\nWe regularly monitor the risks in our commercial loan portfolio, including concentrations in such factors as geographic locations, property types, tenant brand name, borrowing relationships, and lending relationships in the case of participation loans, among other factors. We continually strive to maintain high underwriting standards, including selecting borrowers and guarantors that are financially sound and experienced in the industry, and selecting projects that meet the Bank's lending policies and risk appetite. The properties securing our commercial loan portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. This diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events, environmental factors and natural disasters that may affect any single market or industry. For additional information regarding our commercial loan underwriting and monitoring of risk, see \"Part 1, Item 1. Business - Lending Practices and Underwriting Standards - Commercial Lending.\"\nWe are heavily reliant on technology, and a failure to effectively implement technology initiatives or anticipate future technology needs or demands could adversely affect our business or performance.\nLike most financial institutions, the Bank significantly depends on technology to deliver its products and other services and to otherwise conduct business. To remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient, the Bank invests in system upgrades, new technological solutions, and other technology initiatives. Many of these solutions and initiatives have a significant duration, are tied to critical information systems, and require substantial resources. Although the Bank takes steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these solutions and initiatives, there is no guarantee that they will be implemented on time, within budget, or without negative operational or customer impact. The Bank also may not succeed in anticipating its future technology needs, the technology demands of its customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. If the Bank were to falter in any of these areas, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be required to provide remedial consideration to borrowers whose loans we purchase from correspondent and nationwide lenders if it is discovered that the originating company did not properly comply with lending regulations during the origination process.\nWe purchase whole one- to four-family loans from correspondent and nationwide lenders. While loans purchased on a loan-by-loan basis from correspondent lenders are underwritten by the Bank's underwriters and loans purchased in bulk packages from correspondent and nationwide lenders are evaluated on a certain set of criteria before being purchased, we are still subject to some risks associated with the loan origination process itself. By law, loan originators are required to comply with lending regulations at all times during the origination process. Even though the Bank can contractually pursue the originating company, certain compliance related risks associated with the origination process itself may shift from the originating company to the Bank once the Bank purchases the loan. Should it be discovered, at any point, that an instance of noncompliance occurred by the originating company during the origination process, the Bank may still be held responsible and required to remedy the issue for the loans it purchased from the originator. Remedial actions can include refunding interest paid by the borrower and adjusting the contractual interest rate on the loan to the current market rate if advantageous to the borrower. The Bank no longer purchases loans in bulk from nationwide lenders due primarily to these risks.\nStrong competition may limit growth and profitability.\nWhile we are one of the largest mortgage loan originators in the state of Kansas, we compete in the same market areas as local, regional, and national banks, credit unions, mortgage brokerage firms, investment banking firms, investment brokerage firms, and savings institutions. We must also compete with online investment and mortgage brokerages and online banks that are not confined to any specific market area. Many of these competitors operate on a national or regional level, are a conglomerate of various financial services providers housed under one corporation, or otherwise have substantially greater\nfinancial or technological resources than the Bank. We compete primarily on the basis of the interest rates offered to depositors, the terms of loans offered to borrowers, and the benefits afforded to customers as a local institution and portfolio lender. Our pricing strategy for loan and deposit products includes setting interest rates based on secondary market prices and local competitor pricing for our local markets, and secondary market prices and national competitor pricing for our correspondent lending markets. Should we face competitive pressure to increase deposit rates or decrease loan rates, our net interest income could be adversely affected. Additionally, our competitors may offer products and services that we do not or cannot provide, as certain deposit and loan products fall outside of our accepted level of risk. Our profitability depends upon our ability to compete in our local market areas.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment which limits the manner and scope of our business activities and we may be adversely affected by new and/or changes in laws and regulations or interpretation of existing laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC, FRB, and the FDIC. These regulatory authorities exercise broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank's operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of a bank's ACL, and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws, including a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, like the authority to prohibit \"unfair, deceptive or abusive\" acts and practices. The CFPB also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with regulatory assets exceeding $10 billion at four consecutive quarter-ends. The Bank has not exceeded $10 billion in regulatory assets at four consecutive quarter-ends, but it may at some point in the future. Smaller banks, like the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws and regulations of the CFPB by their primary bank regulators (the OCC, in the case of the Bank). The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.\nAny change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation, interpretation or application, could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Moreover, bank regulatory agencies have been active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, and have issued formal enforcement orders requiring capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements and/or assessing monetary penalties. Bank regulatory agencies, such as the OCC and the FDIC, govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors, and not for the protection or benefit of investors. The CFPB enforces consumer protection laws and regulations for the benefit of the consumer and not the protection or benefit of investors. In addition, new laws and regulations may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations. New laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and securities, the products we offer, the fees we can charge and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.\nThe Company is also directly subject to the requirements of entities that set and interpret the accounting standards such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and indirectly subject to the actions and interpretations of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which establishes auditing and related professional practice standards for registered public accounting firms and inspects registered firms to assess their compliance with certain laws, rules, and professional standards in public company audits. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions and their holding companies conduct business, engage in strategic and tax planning, implement strategic initiatives, and govern financial reporting.\nThe Company's failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in civil or criminal sanctions and money penalties by state and federal agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Part I, Item 1. Business - Regulation and Supervision\" for more information about the regulations to which the Company is subject.\nThe Company's ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions to the Company.\nThe long-term ability of the Company to pay dividends to its stockholders is based primarily upon the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions to the Company, and also on the availability of cash at the holding company level in the event earnings are not sufficient to pay dividends. Under certain circumstances, capital distributions from the Bank to the\nCompany may be subject to regulatory approvals. See \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions\" for additional information.\nOur risk-management and compliance programs and functions may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nWe maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report, and control the risks that we face. These risks include: interest-rate, credit, liquidity, operations, reputation, compliance and litigation. We also maintain a compliance program to identify, measure, assess, and report on our adherence to applicable laws, policies and procedures. While we assess and improve these programs on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that our risk management or compliance programs, along with other related controls, will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in our business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in our risk management or compliance programs, or if our controls do not function as designed, the performance and value of our business could be adversely affected.\nThe Company may not attract and retain skilled employees.\nThe Company's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people can be intense, and the Company spends considerable time and resources attracting and hiring qualified people for its operations. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of the Company's key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business because of their skills, knowledge of the Company's market, and years of industry experience, as well as the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nThe Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of CCB.\nThe success of the Company's acquisition of CCB will depend on, among other things, the ability to realize anticipated cost savings and to combine the businesses of the companies in a manner that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of the companies or result in decreased revenues from customers. If the Company is unable to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully, if at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Additionally, the integration of the two companies could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, procedures and policies that adversely affect the Company's ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Integration efforts will also divert management attention and resources.", "PERMNO": 86820, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "CFFN"}
