{"cik": "1537028", "company": "Independence Contract Drilling, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe face many challenges and risks in the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, and the documents and other information incorporated by reference herein, before investing in our shares. The risks and uncertainties described are not the only ones we face. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect us. If any of these risks were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our shares could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRecent declines in oil prices have adversely affected demand for contract drilling services, which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOil prices declined significantly during the second half of 2014 and have continued to decline in 2015. The closing price of oil was as high as $106.06 per barrel during the third quarter of 2014, as low as $44.08 per barrel in late January 2015 and around $49.84 per barrel during the last week in February 2015 (WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration). As a result of the decline in oil prices, our industry is now experiencing a severe downturn. Market conditions remain very dynamic and are changing quickly and we believe that 2015 will be a very challenging year for our industry.\nWe believe the vast majority of exploration and production companies, including our customers, have significantly reduced their 2015 capital spending plans. The initial impact of these spending reductions is evidenced by the published rig counts, which have declined more than 25% since their recent peak in October 2014, and we believe the rig count in the United States will decline further in 2015.\nAs a result of this deterioration in market conditions, demand for our contract drilling services has declined. One of our non-walking rigs currently is not operating under a contract and four of our rigs that are operating under contracts have terms expiring during the first half of 2015. If we are unable to re-contract these rigs during 2015, it could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we expect that any rig that is recontracted during 2015 will be at dayrates substantially below their current contract rates, which will significantly reduce our profitability and cash flows.\nIn addition, we currently finance our capital expenditures and operations pursuant to a committed $155.0 million revolving line of credit. A significant portion of our borrowing base is tied to the appraised value of our drilling rigs, which\nmay decline if market conditions deteriorate further. A significant decline in our borrowing base could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our revolving credit facility also contains certain restrictive covenants, including a leverage covenant based upon the cash flows of the company. Thus, a significant reduction in our cash flows as a result of the decline in demand for our products and services could reduce or limit the level of funds we are able to borrow under our existing revolving credit facility, and thus have a material adverse affect on our financial condition.\nWe derive all our revenues from companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility in oil and gas prices.\nAs a provider of land-based contract drilling services, our business depends on the level of exploration and production activity by oil and gas companies operating in the U.S., and in particular, the regions where we actively market our contract drilling services. The oil and gas exploration and production industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities. Oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in those prices significantly affect the levels of those activities. Worldwide political, regulatory, economic, and military events as well as natural disasters have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities in the U.S. and the regions where we market our contract drilling services, whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect us in many ways by negatively impacting:\n\u2022\nour revenues, cash flows and profitability;\n\u2022\nthe fair market value of our drilling rig fleet and other assets;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional debt and equity capital required to implement our rig construction and growth strategy, and the cost of that capital; and\n\u2022\nour ability to retain skilled rig personnel whom we need to implement our growth strategy.\nDepending on the market prices of oil and gas, oil and gas exploration and production companies may cancel or curtail their drilling programs and may lower production spending on existing wells, thereby reducing demand for our services. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and gas prices, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe discovery and development rate of new oil and gas reserves, especially shale and other unconventional gas resources for which we market our rigs;\n\u2022\nthe rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\navailable pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity;\n\u2022\nthe levels of oil and gas storage;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and gas exploration and production companies to raise capital;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere;\n\u2022\nactions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022\npolitical instability in the Middle East and other major oil and gas producing regions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations, sanctions and trade restrictions, both domestic and foreign;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign tax policy;\n\u2022\nweather conditions in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nthe pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development and production of their national reserves;\n\u2022\nthe price of foreign imports of oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nthe overall supply and demand for oil and gas; and\n\u2022\nthe development of alternate energy sources and the long-term effects of worldwide energy conservation measures.\nOil and natural gas prices have been volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. For example, U.S. Benchmark crude\u2019s price per barrel (West Texas Intermediate - Cushing, Oklahoma) was $107.95 on June 20, 2014 and had dropped to $44.08 by January 28, 2015, an approximately 59% decrease over a less than eight month period. Future or continued declines and volatility in oil and gas prices, or no improvement in oil and gas prices, from their current levels for an extended period of time, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth strategy.\nOil and natural gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in these prices, significantly impact the level of worldwide drilling and production services activities. Reduced demand for oil and natural gas generally results in lower prices for these commodities and may impact the economics of planned drilling projects and ongoing production projects, resulting in the curtailment, reduction, delay or postponement of such projects for an indeterminate period of time. When drilling and production activity and spending decline, both dayrates and utilization have also historically declined. Declines in\noil and natural gas prices and the general economy could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth strategy.\nIn addition, if oil and natural gas prices decline, companies that planned to finance exploration, development or production projects through the capital markets may be forced to curtail, reduce, postpone or delay drilling activities, and also may experience an inability to pay suppliers. Adverse conditions in the global economic environment could also impact our vendors\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to meet obligations to provide materials and services in general. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results and our ability to timely and successfully implement our growth strategy.\nA significant delay in the completion of the construction of our planned additional rigs in 2015 could materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our growth strategy.\nWe currently have three rigs under construction. Each of the three rigs to be constructed during 2015 is subject to a multi-year drilling contract with a specified delivery date range. If we are unable to deliver a rig in accordance with its delivery deadline, the customer may, subject to a grace period in certain scenarios, terminate the contract, which could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy may require us to commit to the construction of new drilling rigs prior to securing an executed contract for its use. The inability to secure drilling contracts for our new rigs promptly following the completion of their construction could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nBecause much of the equipment and parts required for the construction of our rigs must be ordered in advance, our growth strategy will likely require that we make significant purchases of equipment, and commit to constructing our rigs, prior to having executed customer contracts for their use. If we are unable to timely secure drilling contracts for all of our newly constructed rigs, it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition. We currently have made progress payments of $8.0 million for long-lead time items for new drilling equipment for which purchase has been deferred beyond 2015. If we elect to cancel these orders, the progress payments we have made could be forfeited and we may be subject to additional claims by our vendors.\nAny loss of large customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customer base consists of E&P companies that drill oil and gas wells in the United States in the regions where we market our rigs. We currently have thirteen executed drilling contracts (including for three rigs under construction) with eight different customers. Furthermore, it is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. Daywork contracts in the contract drilling industry typically do not obligate those customers to order additional services from the drilling contractor beyond those for which they have currently contracted. If a major customer decided not to continue to use our services or to terminate an existing contract, or if there is a change of management or ownership of a major customer, revenue would decline and our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth strategy could be adversely affected.\nOne of our drilling rigs became idle in January 2015 and four of our existing drilling contracts are scheduled to terminate during the first half of 2015. If we are unable to renew our expiring contracts at favorable pricing, or alternatively secure new contracts at favorable pricing, it could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAll of our current drilling contracts have original or current extended terms of between 12 and 36 months. In any event, our contracts provide that our customers may terminate at any time upon payment to us of an \u201cearly termination payment.\u201d One of our drilling rigs became idle in January 2015 and four of our existing drilling contracts are scheduled to terminate during 2015. Our customers have no obligation to extend the term of any drilling contract and may elect to release the rig. We have not yet recontracted the rig that went off contract in January 2015 and we cannot assure you that any particular contract will be renewed, or if terminated, that a replacement contract could be immediately secured. In addition, in light of the current downturn in oil prices, we cannot assure you that any replacement contract can be obtained, and if obtained, that it would be on terms as favorable as those of our existing drilling contracts. The failure to renew or timely replace one or more of our expiring contracts could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations involve operating hazards, which if not insured or indemnified against, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the drilling and well services industries, including the risks of:\n\u2022\npersonal injury and loss of life;\n\u2022\nblowouts;\n\u2022\ncratering;\n\u2022\nfires and explosions;\n\u2022\nloss of well control;\n\u2022\ncollapse of the borehole;\n\u2022\ndamaged or lost drilling equipment; and\n\u2022\ndamage or loss from extreme weather and natural disasters.\nAny of these hazards can result in substantial liabilities or losses to us from, among other things:\n\u2022\nsuspension of operations;\n\u2022\ndamage to, or destruction of, our property and equipment and that of others;\n\u2022\ndamage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations through which we drill; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental damage.\nAlthough, we seek to protect ourselves from some but not all operating hazards through insurance coverage, some risks are either not insurable or insurance is available only at rates that we consider uneconomical. Depending on competitive conditions and other factors, we attempt to obtain contractual protection against uninsured operating risks from our customers. However, customers who provide contractual indemnification protection may not in all cases maintain adequate insurance or otherwise have the financial resources necessary to support their indemnification obligations. Our insurance or indemnification arrangements may not adequately protect us against liability or loss from all the hazards of our operations. For example, during March 2014, we experienced damage to the mast of one of our operating rigs that removed the rig from operations for a period of time, during which we were not compensated. We do not carry loss of business insurance for a rig being out of service.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the potential risks affecting our operations and only in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be economical. Our insurance coverage includes deductibles which must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. The occurrence of a significant event that we have not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry in which price competition could reduce our profitability.\nWe encounter substantial competition from other drilling contractors. The competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as recent mergers among E&P companies have reduced the number of available customers and the recent downturn in oil prices has decreased demand for drilling rigs and resulted in downward pricing pressure on operating drilling rigs.\nContract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and the intensity of competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Most drilling services contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids, which also results in price competition.\nIn addition to pricing, we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are availability and condition of equipment, quality of personnel, efficiency of equipment, service quality, experience and safety record. The success of our business depends on our ability to offer safe and highly efficient operations, the quality and efficiency of our rigs and the skills and experience of our rig crews.\nAs a result of competition, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to implement our growth strategy. In addition, the failure to maintain an adequate safety record could harm our ability to secure new drilling contracts. As a relatively new contract driller with limited operating\nhistory, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the reputation for safety and quality required to successfully compete against our competition.\nWe face competition from many competitors with greater resources and greater ability to rapidly respond to changing customer requirements and market conditions.\nWe compete with large national and multi-national companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets.\nFurthermore, some of our competitors\u2019 greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand industry downturns, compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology, retain skilled rig personnel, and build new rigs or acquire and refurbish existing rigs so as to be able to place rigs into service more quickly than us in periods of high drilling demand.\nIn addition, we compete with several smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Smaller competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements.\nFinally, some E&P companies perform horizontal and directional drilling on their wells using their own equipment and personnel. Any increase in the development and utilization of in-house drilling capabilities by our customers could decrease the demand for our services and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nNew technology may cause our drilling methods or equipment to become less competitive.\nThe drilling industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion methods and equipment using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. Changes in technology or improvements in competitors\u2019 equipment could make our equipment less competitive or require significant capital investments to build and maintain a competitive advantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to design, implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to implement new technologies before we can. If we are unable to implement new and emerging technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth strategy.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our activities and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nHydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injection of water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations or ordinances restricting or increasing the costs of hydraulic fracturing could potentially increase our costs of operations and cause a decrease in drilling activity levels in the Permian Basin and other unconventional resource plays and an associated decrease in demand for our rigs and service, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control provisions of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) to exclude certain hydraulic fracturing practices from the definition of \u201cunderground injection.\u201d The Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) has asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel and published guidance relating to such practices in February 2014. Congress has considered bills to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the SDWA, which would have the effect of allowing the EPA to promulgate new regulations and permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing, potentially including chemical disclosure requirements. At the state level, several states in which we operate have adopted regulations requiring the disclosure of certain information regarding hydraulic fracturing fluids.\nScrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways. The EPA commenced a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and issued an update on December 21, 2012, with a draft report expected for public comment and peer review in 2015. On October 21, 2011, the EPA announced its intention to propose regulations under the federal Clean Water Act to regulate wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing. On May 24, 2013, the U.S. Department of the Interior (the \u201cDOI\u201d) published a revised proposed rule that would update existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water. On April 13, 2012, the DOI, the U.S. Department of Energy and the EPA issued a memorandum outlining a multi-agency\ncollaboration on unconventional oil and gas research in response to the White House-entitled \u201cBlueprint for a Secure Energy Future\u201d and the recommendations of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board Subcommittee on Natural Gas. In addition, some states and localities have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations or ordinances that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, that would require, with some exceptions, disclosure of constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids, or that would impose higher taxes, fees or royalties on natural gas production. Moreover, public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production has been increasing, and has resulted in delays of well permits in some areas.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, incurred by our customers or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing in the unconventional resource plays where we focus our operations.\nReduced demand for or excess capacity of drilling services could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur profitability in the future will depend on many factors, especially pricing and utilization rates of our drilling services. A reduction in the demand for drilling rigs or an increase in the supply of drilling rigs, whether through new construction or refurbishment, could decrease the dayrates and utilization rates for our drilling services, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nPrior to the recent decline in oil prices, we and our competitors ordered additional drilling rigs to meet then existing and projected long-term demand, resulting in significant increases in drilling industry capacity. We currently have three rigs under construction and we believe our competitors also have additional rigs under construction. As the recent decline in oil prices demonstrates, our industry is characterized by a high degree of volatility. In the event that our customers reduce their level of investment in exploration, production and development activities, which we believe is currently occurring, the increased supply of drilling rigs could exceed the reduced level of demand for drilling services. Any excess supply could cause our competitors to lower their rates in order to maximize utilization of their fleets, and could lead to a decrease in rates in the drilling industry generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also have outstanding aggregate progress payments of $8.0 million for equipment for new drilling rigs where purchase has been deferred past 2015, which could be subject to forfeiture if depressed market conditions continue and we elected to cancel these orders.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, the loss of whom could materially harm our business.\nOur senior executives are important to our success because they are instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating our business and technology, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, and identifying customers and expansion opportunities. We also depend on the relationships that our senior management has with many of our customers. Losing the services of any of these individuals, in particular Mr. Dunn and Mr. Jacob, our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement could be found. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our senior executives. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nRig upgrade, refurbishment and new rig construction projects are subject to risks which could cause delays or cost overruns and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations, and financial position.\nNew drilling rigs may experience start-up complications during construction or following delivery, and may encounter other operational problems that could result in significant delays, uncompensated downtime, reduced dayrates or the cancellation, termination or non-renewal of drilling contracts. Rig construction projects are subject to risks of delay or significant cost overruns inherent in any large construction project from numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nshortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;\n\u2022\nunscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment or shipyard construction;\n\u2022\nfailure of equipment to meet quality and/or performance standards;\n\u2022\nfinancial or operating difficulties of equipment vendors;\n\u2022\nunanticipated actual or purported change orders;\n\u2022\ninability by us or our customer to obtain required permits or approvals, or to meet applicable regulatory standards in our areas of operations;\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost increases between order and delivery;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions and other events of force majeure;\n\u2022\ndesign or engineering changes; and\n\u2022\nwork stoppages and other labor disputes.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nAs we construct additional rigs in the future, we may experience difficulty integrating those rigs into our operations. Additionally, we may incur leverage and add additional financial risk to our business. To the extent we incur additional leverage in our business, it may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and growth strategy.\nThe process of constructing rigs may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management\u2019s attention and other resources. We may not be able to successfully manage and integrate new rigs into our existing operations or successfully market our rigs and build market share attributable to drilling rigs that we construct. To the extent we experience some or all of these difficulties, our results of operations, financial condition and growth strategy could be adversely affected.\nExpanding our fleet may cause us to incur additional financial leverage, increasing our financial risk and debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth strategy.\nOur current estimated backlog of contract drilling revenue may not ultimately be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our estimated contract drilling backlog for future revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more, was approximately $152.8 million. Fixed-term drilling contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an \u201cearly termination payment\u201d to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. Additionally, in certain circumstances, for example, destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time, our bankruptcy, or a breach of our contract obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us. Additionally, during depressed market conditions, such as those we are currently experiencing, or otherwise, customers may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations or may seek to terminate, renegotiate or fail to honor their contractual obligations. In addition, we may not be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond our control, and our customers may seek to cancel or negotiate our contracts for various reasons, including those described above. As a result, we may be unable to realize all of our current contract drilling backlog. In addition, the renegotiation or termination of fixed-term contracts without the receipt of early termination payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur operating and maintenance costs with respect to our rigs include fixed costs that will not decline in proportion to decreases in dayrates.\nWe do not expect our operating and maintenance costs with respect to our rigs to necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenue. Operating revenue may fluctuate as a function of changes in dayrate, but costs for operating a rig and property taxes are generally fixed or only semi-variable regardless of the dayrate being earned. During times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be immediate as portions of the crew may be required to prepare our rigs for stacking, after which time the crew members are assigned to active rigs or dismissed. Moreover, when our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly. In general, labor costs increase due to higher salary levels, inflation, and increases in workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment. Contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized.\nWe participate in a capital intensive business. We may not be able to finance future growth of our operations.\nThe contract drilling industry is capital intensive. Our cash flow from operations and the continued availability of credit are subject to a number of variables, including general economic conditions, conditions in the oil and gas market, and more specifically, our rig utilization rates, operating margins and ability to control costs and obtain contracts in a competitive industry. Our cash flow from operations and present borrowing capacity may not be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements. We may from time to time seek additional financing, either in the form of bank borrowings, sales of debt or equity securities or otherwise. To the extent our capital resources and cash flow from operations are at any time insufficient to fund our activities or repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, we will need to raise additional funds through public or private financing or additional borrowings. We may not be able to obtain any such capital resources in the amount or at the time when needed. If we are at any time not able to obtain the necessary capital resources, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under applicable debt instruments, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance indebtedness under our revolving credit facility depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the interest or principal, when due, on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. Our revolving credit facility currently restricts our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds from such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations.\nRestrictions in our existing and future debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to engage in certain activities.\nOur revolving credit facility contains a number of significant covenants, including restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake loans to others;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another entity;\n\u2022\ntransfer, lease or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain payments;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\npurchase, hold or acquire capital stock or certain other types of securities;\n\u2022\npay cash dividends;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.\nA breach of any covenant in our revolving credit facility would result in a default. A resulting event of default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the payment of the indebtedness outstanding under, and a termination of, our revolving credit facility and in a default with respect to, and an acceleration of, the indebtedness outstanding under any other debt agreements. The accelerated indebtedness would become immediately due and payable. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility would negatively impact our ability to fund our operations and business strategy.\nOur revolving credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which is calculated monthly and is based upon the appraised value of our eligible drilling fleet and a percentage of our eligible accounts receivable. If a rig becomes idle for longer than 90 consecutive days, it is removed from our borrowing base until it resumes operations. The borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was $114.8 million as calculated as of December 31, 2014, with lender commitments of $155.0 million.\nIn the future, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our revolving credit facility as a result of a decrease in borrowing base due to the issuance of new indebtedness, the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination or an unwillingness or inability on the part of lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations and the inability of other lenders to provide additional funding to cover the defaulting lender\u2019s portion. As a result, we may be unable to\nimplement our respective drilling and development plan, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out business plans, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters.\nWe depend on skilled employees to build and operate our rigs, and any prolonged labor disruption involving our employees could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition by disrupting our ability to perform drilling-related services for our customers. Moreover, unionization efforts have been made from time to time within our industry, with varying degrees of success. Any such unionization could increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nFailure to hire and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business.\nThe delivery of our services and products and construction of our rigs requires personnel with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility of the contract drilling industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive.\nPotential inability or lack of desire by workers to commute to our facilities and job sites and competition for workers from competitors or other industries are factors that could affect our ability to attract and retain workers. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. If either or both of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nOur ability to be productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled personnel and we cannot assure you that at times of high demand we will be able to retain, recruit and train an adequate number of skilled workers. In addition, our ability to expand our operations will depend in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. Our inability to attract and retain skilled workers in sufficient numbers to satisfy our existing service contracts and enter into new contracts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth strategy.\nWe depend on a limited number of vendors, some of which are thinly capitalized and the loss of any of which could disrupt our operations.\nOur contract drilling operations and our ability to construct new drilling rigs in a timely manner depend on the availability of various rig equipment, including VFD drives and drillers cabins, top drives, mud pumps, engines and drill pipe, as well as replacement parts, related rig equipment and fuel. Some of these have been in short supply from time to time. In addition, key rig components critical to the construction of our rigs are either purchased from or fabricated by a single or limited number of vendors. For many of these products and services, there are only a limited number of vendors and suppliers available to us.\nWe do not currently have any long-term supply contracts with any of our suppliers or subcontractors and may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our larger competitors when purchasing from these suppliers and subcontractors. Shortages could occur in these essential components due to an interruption of supply or increased demands in the industry. If we are unable to procure certain of such rig components or services from our subcontractors we would be required to reduce or delay our rig construction and other operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth strategy.\nWe could be adversely affected if shortages of equipment or supplies occur.\nIncreased or decreased demand among drilling contractors for consumable supplies, including fuel, and ancillary rig equipment, such as pumps, valves, drillpipe and engines, may lead to delays in obtaining these materials and our inability to operate our rigs in an efficient manner. Most of our contracts provide that our customers purchase the fuel that run our drilling rigs and thus bear the financial impact of increased fuel prices. However, prolonged shortages in the availability of fuel to run our drilling rigs resulting from action of the elements, terrorism or other force majeure events could result in the suspension of our contracts and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have periodically experienced increased lead times in purchasing ancillary equipment for our drilling rigs. To the extent there are significant delays in being able to purchase important components for our rigs, certain of our rigs may not be available for operation or may not be able to operate as efficiently as expected, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nReduced demand can drive suppliers from the market. With reduced suppliers, consumables for our operations may not be readily available. Additionally, suppliers may experience shortfalls in obtaining their materials and/or labor. Suppliers who have been regular providers to us may experience shortfalls that may lead to delays as we secure other sources.\nLegal proceedings could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time. Lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any litigation or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nRegulatory compliance costs and restrictions, as well as any delays in obtaining permits by our customers for their operations, could impair our business.\nThe operations of our customers are subject to or impacted by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result of changes in regulations and laws relating to the oil and natural gas industry, including land drilling, our customers\u2019 operations could be disrupted or curtailed by governmental authorities. In most states, our customers are required to obtain permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to perform drilling and completion activities. Such permits are typically required by state agencies, but can also be required by federal and local governmental agencies. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location where such drilling and completion activities will be conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions which may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Additionally, the high cost of compliance with applicable regulations may cause customers to discontinue or limit their operations or defer planned drilling, and may discourage companies from continuing development activities. As a result, demand for our services could be substantially affected by regulations adversely impacting the oil and natural gas industry.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant liabilities for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or compliance.\nOur operations are subject to federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of natural resources and the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations and waste management, including the transportation and disposal of waste and other materials. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations on our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the incurrence of capital expenditures to mitigate or prevent releases of materials from our facilities, the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations and the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in investigations, restrictions or orders suspending well operations, the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the revocation of permits and the issuance of corrective action orders, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is inherent risk of environmental costs and liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and oilfield and industrial wastes, air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was without fault or lawful at the time it occurred or as a result of the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Clean-up costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and costs associated with changes in environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLaws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent over time and are expected to continue to do so, which could lead to material increases in costs for future environmental compliance and remediation. The modification or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could curtail exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and natural gas and could limit well servicing opportunities. We may not be able to recover some or any of our costs of compliance with these laws and regulations from insurance.\nPotential listing of species as \u201cendangered\u201d under the federal Endangered Species Act could result in increased costs and new operating restrictions or delays on our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers, which could adversely reduce the amount of contract drilling services that we provide to such customers.\nThe federal Endangered Species Act (the \u201cESA\u201d) and analogous state laws regulate a variety of activities, including oil and gas development, which could have an adverse effect on species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or their habitats. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause oil and natural gas\nexploration and production operators to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in affected areas, which impacts could adversely reduce the amount of drilling activities in affected areas, including support services that we provide to such operators under our contract drilling services segment. Numerous species have been listed or proposed for protected status in areas in which we provide or could in the future provide field services. For instance, in March 2014 the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (the \u201cFWS\u201d) listed the lesser prairie-chicken as threatened and finalized a special rule that would exempt from regulation under the ESA activities harmful to the prairie-chicken if incidental to carrying out the state-developed range-wide lesser prairie-chicken conservation plan. Some environmental groups have filed a notice of intent to sue FWS to require more state protection. The sage grouse and certain wildflower species, among others, are also species that have been or are being considered for protected status under the ESA and whose range can coincide with our oil and natural gas production activities. The presence of protected species in areas where operators for whom we provide contract drilling services conduct exploration and production operations could impair such operators\u2019 ability to timely complete well drilling and development and, consequently, adversely affect the amount of contract drilling or other field services that we provided to such operators, which reduction of services could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting or regulating emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our field services.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases from industrial and energy sources contribute to increases of carbon dioxide levels in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans and contribute to global warming and other environmental effects, the EPA has adopted various regulations under the federal Clean Air Act addressing emissions of greenhouse gases that may affect the oil and gas industry. During 2012, the EPA published rules that include standards to reduce methane emissions associated with oil and gas production. Pursuant to President Obama\u2019s Strategy to Reduce Methane Omissions, and as part of the Administration\u2019s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025, the Obama Administration announced on January 14, 2015 that the EPA is expected to propose in the summer of 2015, and to finalize in 2016, new regulations that will set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas facilities, including production facilities. In addition, the U.S. has been involved in international negotiations regarding greenhouse gas reductions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Additionally, certain U.S. states and regional coalitions of states have adopted measures regulating or limiting greenhouse gases from certain sources or have adopted policies seeking to reduce overall emissions of greenhouse gases. The adoption and implementation of any international treaty or of any federal or state legislation or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to comply with such requirements and possibly require the reduction or limitation of emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations and other sources within the industrial or energy sectors. Such legislation or regulations could adversely affect demand for the production of oil and natural gas and thus reduce demand for the services we provide to oil and natural gas producers as well as increase our operating costs by requiring additional costs to operate and maintain equipment and facilities, install emissions controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes and fees relating to emissions, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases may produce changes in climate or weather, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, which if any such effects were to occur, could have adverse physical effects on our operations, physical assets and field services to exploration and production operators.\nThe effects of severe weather could adversely affect our operations.\nChanges in climate due to global warming trends could adversely affect our operations by limiting, or increasing the costs associated with, equipment or product supplies. In addition, coastal flooding and adverse weather conditions such as increased frequency and/or severity of hurricanes could impair our ability to operate in affected regions of the country. Oil and natural gas operations of our customers located in Louisiana and parts of Texas may be adversely affected by hurricanes and tropical storms, resulting in reduced demand for our services. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include: curtailment of services; weather-related damage to facilities and equipment, suspension of operations; inability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. These constraints could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Unusually warm winters also adversely affect the demand for our services by decreasing the demand for natural gas.\nOur business is subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.\nThreats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. It is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disruption of our and customers\u2019 business operations and safety procedures, loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.\nAny future implementation of price controls on oil and natural gas would affect our operations.\nCertain groups have asserted efforts to have the United States Congress impose some form of price controls on either oil, natural gas, or both. There is no way at this time to know what results these efforts may have. However, any future limits on the price of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImprovements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSince our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\nThe market price of common stock of companies engaged in the oil and gas service industry, including our common stock price, has been highly volatile. Stock price volatility could adversely affect our business operations by, among other things, impeding our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and to obtain additional financing.\nIn addition to the other risk factors discussed in this section, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nfactors influencing the levels of global oil and natural gas exploration and exploitation activities, such as the recent downturn in oil prices;\n\u2022\nthe operating and securities price performance of companies that investors or analysts consider comparable to us;\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets.\nTo the extent that the price of our common stock remains at lower levels or it declines further, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise use our common stock as consideration will be reduced. In addition, increases in our leverage may make it more difficult for us to access additional capital. These factors may limit our ability to implement our operating and growth plans.\nBecause we have no plans to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and our revolving credit facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support our operations and growth. Any payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally available, our financial condition, capital requirements, ability to pay such dividends under our then existing credit facility and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company at a premium that a stockholder may consider favorable, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe existence of some provisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. The provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that could delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control of our company include:\n\u2022\nprovisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent; and\n\u2022\nthe authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.\nFuture offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock in the event of our liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities, which would dilute our existing stockholders or rank senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt or additional offerings of equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, convertible notes and classes of preferred stock. In the event of our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market value of our common stock, or both. Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that would limit amounts available for distribution to holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market value of our common stock and diluting their shareholdings in us.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nIn April 2012, President Obama signed into law the JOBS Act. We are classified as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to, among other things: (i) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; (ii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; (iii) provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or (iv) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if we have more than $1.0 billion of revenues in a fiscal year, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nTo the extent that we rely on any of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies, you will receive less information about our executive compensation and internal control over financial reporting than issuers that are not emerging growth companies. If some investors find our common stock to be less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nExisting stockholders will continue to hold a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock.\nAs of March 13, 2015, Sprott Resource Partnership, Lime Rock Partners III, L.P., 4D Global Energy Advisors SAS, Global Energy Services Operating, LLC, Jennison Associates LLC, Prudential Financial, Inc. and FMR LLC each hold or beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock. The existence of significant stockholders may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with significant stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14852, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "ICD"}
