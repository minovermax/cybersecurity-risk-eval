{"cik": "1591588", "company": "A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business Generally\nOur business is heavily dependent on our credit facility.\nOur business depends substantially on our ability to obtain financing for our operations. A-Mark\u2019s borrowing facility, which we refer to as the Trading Credit Facility, provides A-Mark and CFC with the liquidity to buy and sell billions of dollars of precious metals annually. The Trading Credit Facility is a demand facility with a variable interest rate in which five lending institutions currently participate. A-Mark routinely uses the Trading Credit Facility to purchase metals from its suppliers and for operating cash flow purposes. Our CFC subsidiary also uses the facility to finance its lending activities.\nAn institutional participant in the Trading Credit facility can withdraw at any time on written notice to the Company. The loss of one or more of the lines under the Trading Credit Facility, and the failure of A-Mark to replace those lines, would reduce the financing available to the Company and could limit our ability to conduct our business, including the lending activity of our CFC subsidiary. There can be no assurance that we could procure replacement financing if all or part of the Trading Credit Facility were terminated, on commercially acceptable terms and on a timely basis, or at all.\nBecause the Trading Credit Facility is a demand facility, the lenders may require us to repay the indebtedness outstanding under the facility at any time. They may require repayment of the indebtedness even if we are in compliance with the financial and other covenants under the Trading Credit Facility. If the lenders were to demand repayment, we may not at the time have the financial resources to comply.\nBecause interest under the Trading Credit Facility is variable, we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and we may not be able to pass along to our customers and borrowers some or any part of an increase in the interest that we are required to pay under the facility. Amounts under the Trading Credit Facility bear interest based on one month LIBOR plus a margin and vary by financial institution. The LIBOR rate was approximately 0.19% and 0.15% as of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, respectively.\nA change in the rates of interest charged by the lenders could adversely impact our profitability in a number of ways.\n\u2022\nThe prices that we charge our trading customers include an interest carrying factor that reflects our cost of funds. The trading business is highly price competitive, and characterized by narrow margins. If our cost of funds increases and we cannot pass on the increase to our customers, our gross profit will decrease.\n\u2022\nWe borrow to finance, in part, our inventory of precious metals and coins. If our interest costs increase, we would either have to absorb the increased costs, cutting into our margins, or reduce our inventory levels, which could adversely impact our ability to service our customers.\n\u2022\nIn certain cases, our ability to offer customers financing for their purchases of precious metals and coins at competitive rates is an important factor the customers\u2019 decision to transact with us. The financing we provide to our customers is funded, in part, through the borrowings under our credit facility. If our borrowing costs increase, and our customers are unwilling to finance their purchases at the higher rates, we would lose sales.\nWe could suffer losses with our financing operations.\nWe engage in a variety of financing activities with our customers:\n\u2022\nReceivables from our customers with whom we trade in precious metal products are effectively short-term, non-interest bearing extensions of credit that are, in most cases, secured by the related products maintained in the Company\u2019s possession or by a letter of credit issued on behalf of the customer. On average, these receivables are outstanding for periods of between 8 and 9 days.\n\u2022\nThe Company operates a financing business through CFC that makes secured loans at loan to value ratios-principal loan amount divided by the \"liquidation value\", as conservatively estimated by management, of the collateral-of, in most cases, 50% to 80%. These loans are both variable and fixed interest rate loans, with maturities from six to twelve months.\n\u2022\nWe make advances to our customers on unrefined metals secured by materials received from the customer. These advances are limited to a portion of the materials received.\n\u2022\nThe Company makes unsecured, short-term, non-interest bearing advances to wholesale metals dealers and government mints.\n\u2022\nThe Company periodically extends short-term credit through the issuance of notes receivable to approved customers at interest rates determined on a customer-by-customer basis.\nOur ability to minimize losses on the credit that we extend to our customers depends on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour loan underwriting and other credit policies and controls designed to assure repayment, which may prove inadequate to prevent losses;\n\u2022\nour ability to sell collateral upon customer defaults for amounts sufficient to offset credit losses, which can be affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including (i) changes in economic conditions, (ii) increases in market rates of interest and (iii) changes in the condition or value of the collateral; and\n\u2022\nthe reserves we establish for loan losses, which may prove inadequate.\nOur business is dependent on a concentrated customer base.\nOne of A-Mark's key assets is its customer base. This customer base provides deep distribution of product and makes A-Mark a desirable trading partner for precious metals product manufacturers, including sovereign mints seeking to distribute precious metals coinage or large refiners seeking to sell large volumes of physical precious metals. A single customer represented 30.9% and 25.9% of A-Mark's revenues for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. If our relationship with this customer deteriorated, or if we were to lose this customer, our business would be materially adversely affected.\nThe loss of a government purchaser/distributorship arrangement could materially adversely affect our business.\nA-Mark\u2019s business is heavily dependent on its purchaser/distributorship arrangements with various governmental mints. Our ability to offer numismatic coins and bars to our customers on a competitive basis is based on the ability to purchase products directly from a government source. The arrangements with the governmental mints may be discontinued by them at any time. The loss of an authorized purchaser/distributor relationship, including with the U.S. Mint could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nThe materials held by A-Mark are subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access.\nA-Mark has significant quantities of high-value precious metals on site, at third-party depositories and in transit. There is a risk that part or all of the gold and other precious metals held by A-Mark, whether on its own behalf or on behalf of its customers, could be lost, damaged or stolen. In addition, access to A-Mark\u2019s precious metals could be restricted by natural events (such as an earthquake) or human actions (such as a terrorist attack). Although we maintain insurance on terms and conditions that we consider appropriate, we may not have adequate sources of recovery if our precious metals inventory is lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed, and recovery may be limited. Among other things, our insurance policies exclude coverage in the event of loss as a result of terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\nIn addition, with the establishment of our Logistics facility and the transfer of our wholesale storage operations from third party depositories to that facility, we are assuming greater potential liability for any loss suffered in connection with the stored inventory. Among other things, our insurance, rather than the third-party depository\u2019s, is now the primary risk policy. While we believe we have adequate insurance coverage covering these operations, in the event of any loss in excess of our coverage, we may be held liable for that excess.\nOur business is subject to the risk of fraud and counterfeiting.\nThe precious metals (particularly bullion) business is exposed to the risk of loss as a result of \u201cmaterials fraud\u201d in its various forms. We seek to minimize our exposure to this type of fraud through a number of means, including third-party authentication and verification, reliance on our internal experts and the establishment of procedures designed to detect fraud. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing or identifying this type of fraud, or in obtaining redress in the event such fraud is detected.\nOur business is influenced by political conditions and world events.\nThe precious metals business is especially subject to global political conditions and world events. Precious metals are viewed by some as a secure financial investment in times of political upheaval or unrest, particularly in developing economies, which may drive up pricing. The volatility of the commodity prices for precious metals is also likely to increase in politically uncertain times. Conversely, during periods of relative international calm precious metal volatility is likely to decrease, along with demand, and the prices of precious metals may retreat. Because our business is dependent on the volatility and pricing of precious metals, we are likely to be influenced by world events more than businesses in other economic sectors.\nWe have significant operations outside the United States.\nWe derive over 10% of our revenues from business outside the United States, including from customers in developing countries. Business operations outside the U.S. are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in foreign countries. These include risks of general applicability, such as the need to comply with multiple regulatory regimes; trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; and fluctuations in equity, revenues and profits due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, we do not conduct substantial business with customers in developing countries. However, if our business in these areas of the world were to increase, we would also face risks that are particular to developing countries, including the difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables; protecting inventory and other assets through foreign legal systems; limitations on the repatriation of earnings; currency devaluation and manipulation of exchange rates; and high levels of inflation.\nWe try to manage these risks by monitoring current and anticipated political, economic, legal and regulatory developments in the countries outside the United States in which we operate or have customers and adjusting operations as appropriate, but there can be no assurance that the measures we adopt will be successful in protecting the Company\u2019s business interests.\nWe are dependent on our key management personnel and our trading experts.\nOur performance is dependent on our senior management and certain other key employees. We have employment agreements with Greg Roberts, our CEO; Thor Gjerdrum, our COO; and our senior vice president. These employment agreements all expire at the end of fiscal 2016. These and other employees have expertise in the trading markets, have industry-wide reputations, and perform critical functions for our business. We cannot offer assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms for the renewal of the employment agreements or otherwise retain our key employees. Also, there is significant competition for skilled precious metals traders and other industry professionals. The loss of our current key officers and employees, without the ability to replace them, would materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are focused on growing our business, but there is no assurance that we will be successful.\nWe expect to grow both organically and through opportunistic acquisitions. We have devoted considerable time, resources and efforts over the past few years to our growth strategy. We may not be successful in implementing our growth initiatives, which could adversely affect our business.\nWith the establishment of our Logistics facility, we are undertaking direct responsibility for comprehensive inventory and depository services to support our wholesale operations beyond that which we have provided in the past. We may not have the expertise to perform such services successfully. In addition, we have no prior experience offering the type of turn-key logistics services to our retail customers that Logistics intends to provide. The efforts to establish and operate Logistics have placed, and are expected to continue to place, demands on our management and other personnel and resources, and have required, and will continue to require, timely and continued investment in facilities, personnel and financial and management systems and controls. If we are not successful with our Logistics operations, our operations as a whole could be adversely affected.\nOur bank group has approved our Logistics facility as an authorized depository. If that approval were to be withdrawn for any reason, we would no longer be able to keep inventory at that location, which would substantially limit our ability to conduct business from that facility.\nLiquidity constraints may limit our ability to grow our business.\nTo accomplish our growth strategy, we will require adequate sources of liquidity to fund both our existing business and our expansion activity. Currently, our sources of liquidity are the cash that we generate from operations and our borrowing availability under the Trading Credit Facility. There can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate to support the growth that we are hoping to achieve or that additional sources of financing for this purpose, in the form of additional debt or equity financing, will be available to us, on satisfactory terms or at all. Also, the Trading Credit Facility contains, and any future debt financing is likely to contain, various financial and other restrictive covenants. The need to comply with these covenants may limit our ability to implement our growth initiatives.\nWe expect to grow in part through acquisitions, but an acquisition strategy entails risks.\nWe expect to grow in part through acquisitions. We will consider potential acquisitions of varying sizes and may, on a selective basis, pursue acquisitions or consolidation opportunities involving other public companies or privately held companies. However, it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions. Acquisitions entails certain risks, including: unrecorded liabilities of acquired companies that we fail to discover during our due diligence investigations; difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company within our existing operations or in maintaining uniform standards; loss of key employees of the acquired company; and strains on management and other personnel time and resources both to research and integrate acquisitions.\nWe expect to pay for future acquisitions using cash, capital stock, notes and/or assumption of indebtedness. To the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient to fund future acquisitions, we will require additional debt or equity financing and, consequently, our indebtedness may increase or shareholders may be diluted as we implement our growth strategy.\nWe are subject to government regulations, and the cost of compliance could increase.\nThere are various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations that affect our trading business. For example, we are required to comply with a variety of anti-money laundering and know-your customer rules in response to the USA Patriot Act.\nThe SEC has promulgated final rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act regarding disclosure, on an annual basis, of the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as conflict minerals, in products manufactured by public companies. These new rules require due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo (the DRC) or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the DRC.\nThe Company has concluded that it is not currently subject to the conflict minerals rules because it is not a manufacturer of conflict minerals under the definitions set forth in the rules. Depending on developments in the Company\u2019s business, it could become subject to the rules at some point in the future. In that event, there will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the origin of gold used in our products. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of gold used in our products. Also, we may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and reputational challenges if the due diligence procedures we implement do not enable us to verify the origins for the gold used in our products or to determine that the gold is conflict free.\nCFC operates under a California Finance Lenders License issued by the California Department of Corporations. CFC is required to submit a finance lender law annual report to the state which summarizes certain loan portfolio and financial information regarding CFC. The Department of Corporations may audit the books and records of CFC to determine whether CFC is in compliance with the terms of its lending license.\nThere can be no assurance that the regulation of our trading and lending businesses will not increase or that compliance with the applicable regulations will not become more costly or require us to modify our business practices.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe business of buying and selling precious metals is global and highly competitive. The Company competes with precious metals trading firms and banks throughout North America, Europe and elsewhere in the world, some of whom have greater financial and other resources, and greater name recognition, than the Company. We believe that, as a full service firm devoted exclusively to precious metals trading, we offer pricing, product availability, execution, financing alternatives and storage options that are attractive to our customers and allow us to compete effectively. We also believe that our purchaser/distributorship arrangements with various governmental mints give us a competitive advantage in our coin distribution business. However, given the global reach of the precious metals trading business, the absence of intellectual property protections and the availability of numerous, evolving platforms for trading in precious metals, we cannot assure you that A-Mark will be able to continue to compete successfully or that future developments in the industry will not create additional competitive challenges.\nWe rely extensively on computer systems to execute trades and process transactions, and we could suffer substantial damages if the operation of these systems were interrupted.\nWe rely on our computer and communications hardware and software systems to execute a large volume of trading transactions each year. It is therefore critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of these systems, and we have invested considerable resources to protect our systems from physical compromise and security breaches and to maintain backup and redundancy. Nevertheless, our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, including breaches of our transaction processing or other systems, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees. If our systems are breached, damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to provide quotations or trading services in the interim, and we may face costly litigation.\nIf our customer data were breached, we could suffer damages and loss of reputation.\nBy the nature of our business, we maintain significant amounts of customer data on our systems. Moreover, certain third party providers have access to confidential data concerning the Company in the ordinary course of their business relationships with the Company. In recent years, various companies, including companies that are significantly larger than us, have reported breaches of their computer systems that have resulted in the compromise of customer data. Any significant compromise or breach of customer or company data held or maintained by either the Company or our third party providers could significantly damage our reputation and result in costs, lost trades, fines and lawsuits. The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches.\nRisks Relating to Commodities\nA-Mark\u2019s business is heavily influenced by volatility in commodities prices.\nA primary driver of A-Mark\u2019s profitability is volatility in commodities prices, which leads to wider bid and ask spreads. Among the factors that can impact the price of precious metals are supply and demand of precious metals; political, economic, and global financial events; movement of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies; and the activity of large speculators such as hedge funds. If commodity prices were to stagnate, there would likely be a reduction in trading activity, resulting in less demand for the services A-Mark provides, which could materially adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations.\nThis volatility may drive fluctuation of our revenues, as a consequence of which our results for any one period may not be indicative of the results to be expected for any other period. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nOur business is exposed to commodity price risks, and our hedging activity to protect our inventory is subject to risks of default by our counterparties.\nA-Mark\u2019s precious metals inventories are subject to market value changes created by change in the underlying commodity price, as well as supply and demand of the individual products the Company trades. In addition, open sale and purchase commitments are subject to changes in value between the date the purchase or sale is fixed (the trade date) and the date metal is delivered or received (the settlement date). A-Mark seeks to minimize the effect of price changes of the underlying commodity through the use of financial derivative instruments, such as forward and futures contracts. A-Mark\u2019s policy is to remain substantially hedged as to its inventory position and its individual sale and purchase commitments. A-Mark\u2019s management monitors its hedged exposure daily. However, there can be no assurance that these hedging activities will be adequate to protect the Company against commodity price risks associated with A-Mark\u2019s business activities.\nFurthermore, even if we are fully hedged as to any given position, there is the risk of default by our counterparties to the hedge. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIncreased commodity pricing could limit the inventory that we are able to carry.\nWe maintain a large and varied inventory of precious metal products, including bullion and coins, in order to support our trading activities and provide our customers with superior service. The amount of inventory that we are able to carry is constrained by the borrowing limitations and working capital covenants under our credit facility. If commodity prices were to rise substantially, and we were unable to modify the terms of our credit facility to compensate for the increase, the quantity of product that we could finance, and hence maintain in our inventory, would fall. This would likely have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act could adversely impact our use of derivative instruments to hedge precious metal prices and may have other adverse effects on our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation, including with respect to derivative contracts on commodities. This legislation and any implementing regulations could significantly increase the cost of some commodity derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of some commodity derivative contracts, reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing commodity derivative contracts and potentially increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank legislation and regulations, we would be exposed to inventory and other risks associated with fluctuations in commodity prices. Also, if the Dodd-Frank legislation and regulations result in less volatility in commodity prices, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on the efficient functioning of commodity exchanges around the world, and disruptions on these exchanges could adversely affect our business.\nThe Company buys and sells precious metals contracts on commodity exchanges around the world, both in support of its customer operations and to hedge its inventory and transactional exposure against fluctuations in commodity prices. The Company\u2019s ability to engage in these activities would be compromised if the exchanges on which the Company trades or any of their clearinghouses were to discontinue operations or to experience disruptions in trading, due to computer problems, unsettled markets or other factors. The Company may also experience risk of loss if futures commission merchants or commodity brokers with whom the Company deals were to become insolvent or bankrupt.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nPublic company costs have increased our expenses and administrative burden, in particular in order to bring our Company into compliance with certain provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.\nAs a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. These increased costs and expenses may arise from various factors, including financial reporting costs associated with complying with federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002).\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and related regulations implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ have created uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. Applicable laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased selling, general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are required to implement standalone policies and procedures to comply with the requirements of Section 404. During the course of our testing of our internal controls and procedures, we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet our deadline for compliance with Section 404. Testing and maintaining internal controls can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are also important to the operation of our business. We also expect that the imposition of these regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting, then investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we do not maintain effective internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial information on a timely basis, which could harm the trading price of our common stock, impair our ability to raise additional capital, or jeopardize our continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or any other stock exchange on which common stock may be listed.\nThe Company has determined that it qualifies as a smaller reporting company as of December 31, 2014. As such, it is not categorized as an accelerated filer for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Therefore, the Company is not required to obtain a report by our independent registered public accounting firm that addresses the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for that year. The Company will continue to be exempt from the requirement of obtaining such a report unless and until it meets the definition of an accelerated filer.\nWe may not be able to continue to pay dividends.\nEffective March 2, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a cash dividend policy calling for the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per common share. Under the approved cash dividend policy, the declaration of cash dividends in the future is subject to the determination each quarter by the Board of Directors, based on a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s\nfinancial performance, available cash resources, cash requirements, bank covenants, and alternative uses of cash that the Board of Directors may conclude would represent an opportunity to generate a greater return on investment for the Company. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to pay dividends on a regular basis. If the Board of Directors were to determine not to pay dividends in the future, shareholders would not receive any further return on an investment in our capital stock in the form of dividends, and may only obtain an economic benefit from the common stock only after an increase in its trading price and only by selling the common stock.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain certain anti-takeover provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company without negotiating with our board of directors. Such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company\u2019s securities. Certain of such provisions allow the Company to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock, impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions and set forth rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings.\nWe believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. However, these provisions apply even if an acquisition offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders. Accordingly, in the event that our board determines that a potential business combination transaction is not in the best interests of our Company and our shareholders, but certain shareholders believe that such a transaction would be beneficial to the Company and its shareholders, such shareholders may elect to sell their shares in the Company and the trading price of our common stock could decrease.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company could be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in A-Mark potentially will be diluted in the future because of additional equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees in the future. We have established an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of common stock-based equity awards to our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, we may issue equity in order to raise capital or in connection with future acquisitions and strategic investments, which would dilute your percentage ownership.\nOur board and management beneficially own a sizeable percentage of our common stock and therefore have the ability to exert substantial influence as shareholders.\nMembers of our board and management beneficially own over 45% of our outstanding common stock. Acting together in their capacity as shareholders, the board members and management could exert substantial influence over matters on which a shareholder vote is required, such as the approval of business combination transactions. Also because of the size of their beneficial ownership, the board members and management may be in a position effectively to determine the outcome of the election of directors and the vote on shareholder proposals. The concentration of beneficial ownership in the hands of our board and management may therefore limit the ability of our public shareholders to influence the affairs of the Company.\nIf the Company's spinoff from SGI is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nIn connection with the spinoff, SGI received the written opinion of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP (Kramer Levin)to the effect that the spinoff qualified as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, and that for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) no gain or loss was recognized by SGI upon the distribution of our common stock in the spinoff, and (ii) no gain or loss was recognized by, and no amount was included in the income of, holders of SGI common stock upon the receipt of shares of our common stock in the spinoff. The opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and there is no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. In addition, the opinion of Kramer Levin relied on certain representations and covenants delivered by SGI and us. If, notwithstanding the conclusions included in the opinion, it is ultimately determined that the distribution does not qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each SGI shareholder that is subject to U.S. federal income tax and that received shares of our common stock in the distribution could be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares. In addition, if the distribution were not to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then SGI would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common stock distributed to SGI shareholders on the date of the distribution over SGI\u2019s tax basis in such shares. Also, we could have an indemnification obligation to SGI related to its tax liability.\nWe might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances because of restrictions relating to U.S. federal income tax requirements for tax-free distributions.\nOur ability to engage in significant equity transactions is restricted in order to preserve for U.S. federal income tax purposes the tax-free nature of the distribution by SGI. Even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, it may be taxable to SGI if 50% or more, by vote or value, of shares of our common stock or SGI\u2019s common stock are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. For this purpose, any acquisitions or issuances of SGI\u2019s common stock within two years before the distribution, and any acquisitions or issuances of our or SGI\u2019s common stock within two years after the distribution, generally are presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or SGI may be able to rebut that presumption. If an acquisition or issuance of shares of our common stock or SGI\u2019s common stock triggers the application of Section 355(e) of the Code, SGI would recognize a taxable gain to the extent the fair market value of our common stock immediately prior to the distribution exceeds SGI\u2019s tax basis in our common stock at such time.\nUnder the tax separation agreement, there are restrictions on our ability to take actions that could cause the distribution to fail to qualify for favorable treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. These restrictions may prevent us from entering into transactions which might be advantageous to us or our shareholders.\nThere can be no assurance that SGI will not enter insolvency proceedings.\nThere is no assurance that, in the future, SGI will not be subject to bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings. If that were the case, SGI creditors may allege that SGI was insolvent at the time of the distribution, or was rendered insolvent as a result of the distribution, such that the distribution constituted a fraudulent conveyance, and such creditors could seek to recover the A-Mark shares distributed in the spinoff or their value.\nAs disclosed in SGI\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K, in May 2006, Spanish judicial authorities shut down the operations of Afinsa and began an investigation related to alleged criminal wrongdoing, including money laundering, fraud, tax evasion and criminal insolvency. The Spanish criminal investigation initially focused on Afinsa and certain of its executives and was later expanded to include several former officers and directors of SGI and Central de Compras, including Greg Manning, a former chief executive officer of SGI. The allegations against Afinsa and the certain named individuals relate to the central claim that Afinsa's business operations constituted a fraudulent \u201cPonzi scheme,\u201d whereby funds received from later investors were used to pay interest to earlier investors, and that the stamps that were the subject of the investment contracts were highly overvalued. Spanish authorities have alleged that Mr. Manning knew Afinsa's business, and aided and abetted in its activity by, among other things, causing SGI to supply allegedly overvalued stamps to Afinsa.\nThe Company understands that under Spanish law, if any of the former officers or directors of SGI or its subsidiary were ultimately found guilty, then, under the principle of secondary civil liability, SGI could be held liable for certain associated damages.\nMr. Manning, other former directors and officers of SGI, and SGI itself, on a secondary civil liability basis, are parties to the proceedings. The charges include a civil demand for substantial monetary damages.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings, and we cannot assure you that the solvency of SGI could not be deemed to be affected by the proceedings.", "PERMNO": 14532, "SIC": 5051, "TIC": "AMRK"}
