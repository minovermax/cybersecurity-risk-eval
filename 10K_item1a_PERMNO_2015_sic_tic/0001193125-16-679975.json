RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating the Company and its common stock. Any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to the Company\u2019s business, risks related to the Company\u2019s Separation from 21st Century Fox and risks related to the Company\u2019s common stock.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nA Decline in Customer Advertising Expenditures in the Company\u2019s Newspaper and Other Businesses Could Cause its Revenues and Operating Results to Decline Significantly in any Given Period or in Specific Markets.\nThe Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers, integrated marketing services and digital media properties. The Company and its affiliates also derive revenues from the sale of advertising on their cable channels and pay-TV programming. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. National and local economic conditions, particularly in major metropolitan markets, affect the levels of retail, national and classified newspaper advertising revenue. Changes in gross domestic product, consumer spending, housing sales, auto sales, unemployment rates and job creation all impact demand for advertising. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may also reduce the Company\u2019s overall advertising revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, demographics of the customer base, advertising rates and results observed by advertisers. For example, circulation levels for the Company\u2019s newspapers and ratings points for its cable channels are among the factors that are weighed by advertisers when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the Company as well as advertising rates. For the Company\u2019s digital media properties, advertisers use various metrics to evaluate demand such as the number of visits, number of users, user engagement and, for digital real estate services, the number and quality of leads provided. Demand for the Company\u2019s products and services depends in turn upon the Company\u2019s ability to differentiate and distinguish those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors in a timely manner. Technological and other developments may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the Company\u2019s offerings to advertisers.\nThe increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content is driving a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional print to digital. The development of new devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. The range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. In addition, in the past, rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising. As a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure. Consequently, the Company\u2019s digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption.\nThe digital advertising market also continues to undergo significant changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues. Digital advertising networks and exchanges, real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure. New delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers. In addition, evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising, including the industry-wide standard on viewability, as well as the development and adoption of technology designed to block the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices, may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues. As the digital advertising market continues to evolve, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on, among other things, its ability to drive scale, engage digital audiences and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s platforms to its advertising customers, including through more targeted, data-driven offerings.\nWhile the Company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges, there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful. If the Company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its print and digital platforms and high-quality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multi-platform advertising programs, its results may suffer. A decrease in advertising expenditures by the Company\u2019s customers, reduced demand for the Company\u2019s offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses and assets.\nThe Company\u2019s Businesses Face Significant Competition from Other Sources of News, Information and Entertainment Content.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses face significant competition from other sources of news, information and entertainment content, including both traditional and new content providers. This competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital and other technologies and platforms, and the Company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives. For example, advertising and circulation revenues in the Company\u2019s News and Information Services segment may continue to decline, reflecting general\ntrends in the newspaper industry such as declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers\u2019 increasing reliance on a variety of content providers, including news aggregation websites and customized news feeds, for the delivery of news and information through the Internet, often without charge. Internet sites and mobile applications devoted to recruitment, automobile sales and real estate services have become significant competitors of the Company\u2019s newspapers and websites for classified advertising sales. In addition, due to innovations in content distribution platforms, consumers are now more readily able to watch Internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices, in some cases also without charge, which could reduce consumer demand for the Company and its affiliates\u2019 television programming and pay-TV services and adversely affect both its subscription revenue and advertisers\u2019 willingness to purchase television advertising from the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively depends upon its ability to differentiate and distinguish its products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors, which in turn, depends on many factors both within and beyond its control. For example, the Company relies on audience acceptance of the high-quality content in its newspapers, book titles, cable channels and pay-TV programming in order to retain and grow their audiences. Similarly, the success of the Company\u2019s digital real estate services business depends in part on providing more comprehensive, current and accurate real estate listing data than its competitors, which the Company generally obtains through short-term arrangements with MLSs, real estate brokers, real estate agents and other third parties that may not be renewed and/or may be terminated with limited or no notice. Online traffic is also driven by internet search results, and any failure to successfully manage and adapt to changes in search engine optimization across the Company\u2019s businesses could result in significant decreases in traffic to our digital properties, lower advertiser interest in those properties and increased costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic.\nSome of the Company\u2019s current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than it does, which may allow them to respond more effectively to new technologies and changes in market conditions. If the Company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe Company Must Respond to New Technologies and Changes in Consumer Behavior and Continue to Innovate and Provide Useful Products in Order to Remain Competitive.\nTechnology continues to evolve rapidly, and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the Company\u2019s products and services less valuable. For example, alternative methods for the delivery, storage and consumption of digital content, including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices, digital distribution models for books and Internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading, have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume digital content. Content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the Internet, often without charge, and consumers are able to view such Internet-delivered content on portable devices and televisions. Enhanced Internet capabilities and the development of new media channels may continue to reduce the demand for newspapers and television viewership, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s revenues.\nOther digital platforms and technologies, such as user-generated sites and self-publishing tools, have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale, allowing digital content providers, customers, suppliers and other third parties to compete with us, often at a lower cost. This trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the Company\u2019s products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content and result in relatively low barriers to entry for competing Internet-based products and services. Additional digital distribution channels, such as the Internet and online retailers, have presented, and may continue to present, challenges to the Company\u2019s businesses, including its traditional book publishing model, which could adversely affect sales volume and/or pricing.\nIn order to succeed, the Company must continue to innovate to ensure that its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers. The Company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures in order to respond to new technologies, new and enhanced offerings from its competitors, and changes in consumer behavior, and there is a risk that its responses and strategies to remain competitive, including distribution of its content on a \u201cpay\u201d basis, may not be adopted by consumers. The Company\u2019s failure to protect and exploit the value of its content, while responding to and developing new technologies, products, services and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer, audience and/or user base to decline, in some cases precipitously, and could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses, asset values and results of operations.\nThe Inability to Renew Sports Programming Rights Could Cause the Revenue of Certain of the Company\u2019s Australian Operating Businesses to Decline Significantly in any Given Period, and Programming Costs Could Also Increase Upon Renewal.\nThe sports rights contracts between certain of the Company\u2019s Australian operating businesses, on the one hand, and various professional sports leagues and teams, on the other, have varying duration and renewal terms. As these contracts expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought; however, third parties may outbid the current rights holders for the rights contracts. In addition, professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost. The loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the Company and lead to customer dissatisfaction or, in some cases, loss of customers, which could, in turn, adversely affect its revenues. Upon renewal, the Company\u2019s results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates.\nFluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Results of Operations.\nThe Company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in foreign currencies, primarily the Australian dollar and the British pound sterling. Since the Company\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on the Company\u2019s earnings, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its results of operations in a given period or in specific markets.\nWeak Domestic and Global Economic Conditions and Volatility and Disruption in the Financial and Other Markets May Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business.\nThe U.S. and global economies have undergone periods of economic uncertainty which resulted in, among other things, a general tightening in the credit markets, limited access to the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market. The resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the Company does business and had an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, including advertising revenues. Any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the Company\u2019s business, reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers, books, digital real estate services business, television operations and other consumer products and services. In addition, further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the Company to obtain financing. These conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the Company does business to satisfy their obligations to the Company, including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms. The Company is particularly exposed to certain Australian business risks, including specific Australian legal and regulatory risks, consumer preferences and competition, because it holds a substantial amount of Australian assets. As a result, the Company\u2019s results of operations may\nbe adversely affected by negative developments in the Australian market. The Company also has significant operations in the U.K., which recently voted in a referendum to leave the European Union. While the referendum is advisory, the U.K. Government has stated that it intends to give effect to the results of the vote. An exit of the U.K. from the European Union could significantly affect the fiscal, monetary and regulatory landscape in the U.K., lead other member countries to consider leaving the European Union, result in additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s businesses in the U.K. and elsewhere. Although the Company believes that its capitalization, operating cash flow and current access to credit markets, including the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility, will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global capital and credit markets will not impair the Company\u2019s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing.\nThe Company Has Made and May Continue to Make Strategic Acquisitions and Investments That Introduce Significant Risks and Uncertainties.\nIn order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the Company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, (4) with respect to investments, risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business, (5) the risk of diverting the attention of the Company\u2019s senior management from the Company\u2019s operations, (6) the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems, (7) the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses, (8) potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business or investment and (9) in some cases, increased regulation.\nIf any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the Company\u2019s existing businesses, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, and the Company may be required to record non-cash impairment charges for the write-down of certain acquired assets.\nThe Company Does Not Have the Right to Manage Foxtel, Which Means It is Not Able to Cause Foxtel to Operate or Make Corporate Decisions in a Manner that is Favorable to the Company.\nThe Company does not have the right to manage the business or affairs of Foxtel. While the Company\u2019s rights include the right to appoint one-half of the board of directors of Foxtel, the Company is not able to cause management or the board of directors to take any specific actions on its behalf, including with regards to declaring and paying dividends.\nThe Company Relies on Network and Information Systems and Other Technology Whose Failure or Misuse Could Cause a Disruption of Services or Loss or Improper Disclosure of Personal Data, Business Information, Including Intellectual Property, or Other Confidential Information, Resulting in Increased Costs or Loss of Revenue.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the Company\u2019s network management, are important to its business activities. The Company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and \u201ccloud-based\u201d systems and services that support a variety of business operations. Network and information systems-related events affecting the Company\u2019s systems, or those of third parties upon which the Company\u2019s business relies, such as computer hackings, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities, human error or malfeasance that may affect such\nsystems, could result in disruption of the Company\u2019s business and/or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. In addition, hardware or software applications the Company develops or procures from third parties may contain design or manufacturing defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security. In recent years, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies\u2019 network and information systems, and such attacks have become more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. As a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Efforts by the Company and its vendors to develop, implement and maintain security measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, and any network and information systems-related events could require the Company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. While the Company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of our system.\nA significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the Company\u2019s systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of customers or revenues and other financial losses. If any such failure, interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the Company\u2019s information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal, credit card, confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the Company\u2019s business, including its intellectual property, the Company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy.\nThe Company Could Suffer Losses Due to Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges.\nAs a result of adverse developments in the Company\u2019s industry and challenging economic and market conditions, the Company may recognize impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other long-lived assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results. When the Company acquires a business, it records goodwill in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, as of the acquisition date. The Company\u2019s management must regularly evaluate goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the Company\u2019s cash flows in order to determine whether, based on projected discounted future cash flows, the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the Company should recognize an impairment. In accordance with GAAP, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including distribution networks, newspaper mastheads, imprints and trademarks, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the capital markets or the economy generally, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and long-lived assets, or require the Company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. Any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue and/or the expected popularity of the programming for which the Company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. Any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required. Any such charge could be material to the Company\u2019s reported results of operations. The News and Information Services and Cable Network Programming segments have reporting units with goodwill that is at risk for future impairment. As of June 30, 2016, nearly $1.0 billion of goodwill at these reporting units was at risk for future impairment because the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values by less than 10%. The Company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends.\nThe Company\u2019s Business Could Be Adversely Impacted by Changes in Governmental Policy and Regulation.\nVarious aspects of the Company\u2019s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Company\u2019s products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on its interests.\nFor example, the Company\u2019s Australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the Australian media industry or to Australian companies in general. This includes:\n\u2022\nanti-siphoning legislation which currently prevents pay-TV providers such as Foxtel from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the Olympic Games and certain Australian Rules football and cricket matches) unless:\n-\nnational and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event;\n-\nthe rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the Australian population; or\n-\nthe rights to televise are also held by one of Australia\u2019s two major government-funded broadcasters; and\n\u2022\nother parts of the Broadcasting Services Act that regulate ownership interests and control of Australian media organizations. Such legislation may have an impact on the Company\u2019s ownership structure and operations and may restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities. For example, current media diversity rules would prevent the Company from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area.\nThe Company\u2019s business activities are also subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. These laws and regulations could be costly to comply with, limit or restrict aspects of the Company\u2019s business, including, for example, by restricting the use of personal and profiling data to deliver targeted advertisements, and subject the Company to claims and other remedies. For example, the European Union recently adopted the GDPR, which expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the European Union and significantly increases penalties for non-compliance. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation-Data Privacy and Security\u201d for more information.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s newspaper businesses in the U.K. are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press, which was established by Prime Minister David Cameron in mid-2011. The U.K. Government subsequently published a Royal Charter on Self-Regulation of the Press which established a Recognition Panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press self-regulatory body. No such regulator has yet been approved by the Recognition Panel, although it is currently considering an application by a newly-formed independent body, IMPRESS. In the meantime, a majority of the U.K. press has established an alternative regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, or IPSO, which began operating in September 2014. IPSO, which has indicated that it does not intend to seek approval by the Recognition Panel, has powers to impose burdens on the print media in the U.K., including the Company\u2019s U.K.-based newspaper businesses. These powers, which include the ability to impose fines of up to \u00a31 million for breaches of IPSO\u2019s Editor\u2019s Code of Practice, may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance.\nAdverse Results from Litigation or Other Proceedings Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business Practices and Operating Results.\nFrom time to time, the Company is party to litigation, as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. For example, a competitor of the Company\u2019s NAM business has filed lawsuits against NAM alleging antitrust violations and seeking treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys\u2019 fees. The outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition as well as the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted. For example, in February 2016, as part of a settlement agreement relating to an action brought by customers of the NAM business, the Company agreed, subject to District Court approval, to pay the plaintiffs and their attorneys approximately $250 million and settled related claims for approximately $30 million. In addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the Company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for more information.\nNewsprint Prices May Continue to Be Volatile and Difficult to Predict and Control.\nNewsprint is one of the largest expenses of the Company\u2019s newspaper publishing units. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company\u2019s average cost per ton of newsprint was approximately 16% lower than its historical average annual cost per ton over the past five fiscal years on a constant currency basis. The price of newsprint has historically been volatile and the consolidation of newsprint mills over the years has reduced the number of suppliers, which has led to increases in newsprint prices. Failure to maintain the Company\u2019s current consumption levels, further supplier consolidation or the inability to maintain the Company\u2019s existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers could adversely impact newsprint prices in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s International Operations Expose it to Additional Risks that Could Adversely Affect its Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition.\nIn its fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, approximately 54% of the Company\u2019s revenues were derived outside the U.S., and the Company is focused on expanding the international scope of its operations. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including (1) issues related to managing international operations; (2) economic uncertainty and volatility in local markets and political or social instability; (3) potentially adverse changes in tax laws and regulations; (4) complying with international laws and regulations, including foreign ownership restrictions and data privacy requirements; (5) complying with anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act; (6) restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange; and (7) complying with local labor laws and regulations. Events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the Company\u2019s international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Challenges associated with operating globally may increase as the Company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities.\nThere Can Be No Assurance That the Company Will Have Access to the Capital Markets on Terms Acceptable to It.\nFrom time to time the Company may need or desire to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although the Company believes that the sources of capital currently in place, including the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility, will permit the Company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, the Company\u2019s access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to: (1) the Company\u2019s financial performance, (2) the Company\u2019s credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (3) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (4) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance, particularly as a company that currently has no credit rating, that the Company will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it.\nTechnological Developments May Increase the Threat of Content Piracy and Limit the Company\u2019s Ability to Protect Its Intellectual Property Rights.\nThe Company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy; however, policing unauthorized use of its products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the Company may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties. Developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. The Company has taken, and will continue to take, a variety of actions to combat piracy, both individually and, in some instances, together with industry associations. However, protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the Company\u2019s rights, or if existing laws are changed, the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy.\nThe Company\u2019s Business Relies on Certain Intellectual Property and Brands.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish and protect their intellectual property and brand names. The Company believes its proprietary trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. However, the Company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights will be upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the Company against infringement claims by third parties. Any failure by the Company to effectively protect its intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the Company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims.\nThe Company\u2019s Relationship with NAR is an Important Part of its Digital Real Estate Services Business in the U.S. and this Business Could be Harmed if it were to Lose the Benefits of this Relationship.\nMove, the Company\u2019s digital real estate services business in the U.S., licenses the realtor.com\u00ae trademark and website address, as well as the REALTOR\u00ae trademark, from NAR pursuant to a trademark license agreement (the \u201cNAR License\u201d). Move also operates the realtor.com\u00ae website under an agreement with NAR that is perpetual in duration. However, NAR may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractually-specified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods. If the operating agreement with NAR is terminated, the NAR License would also terminate, and Move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the realtor.com\u00ae website to NAR and provide NAR with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers. NAR would then be able to operate a realtor.com\u00ae website, either by itself or with another third party.\nIn addition to the contractual limitations and risks described above, any adverse developments in Move\u2019s business relationship with NAR as a result of existing or new areas of conflict or potential conflict between Move\u2019s interests and NAR\u2019s interests, changes in the real estate industry or other causes could also adversely affect Move\u2019s business, particularly as many of its customers and data providers are members of, have interests that are closely aligned with, or are otherwise influenced by, NAR.\nLabor Disputes May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Business.\nIn a variety of the Company\u2019s businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. If the Company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Separation from 21st Century Fox\nIf the Separation, Together with Certain Related Transactions, Were Ultimately Determined to be Taxable Transactions for U.S. Federal and/or Other Jurisdictions\u2019 Income Tax Purposes, then the Company, 21st Century Fox and Its Stockholders Could Be Subject to Significant Tax Liability, and the Company may be Required to Indemnify 21st Century Fox for Tax-Related Liabilities Incurred by 21st Century Fox.\nIn connection with the Separation, 21st Century Fox received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock qualified as tax-free under Sections 368 and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares. In addition, 21st Century Fox received an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the tax-free status of the Separation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including the satisfaction of the requirements under Sections 368 and 355 of the Code not specifically addressed in the IRS private letter ruling. The opinion of 21st Century Fox\u2019s tax counsel is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there is no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position.\nThe private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations from the Company and 21st Century Fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion, the IRS and/or other tax authorities could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganization transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated, or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons. If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and U.S. stockholders and certain non-U.S. stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, if the internal reorganization and/or the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, 21st Century Fox and/or the Company would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and 21st Century Fox would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock distributed to 21st Century Fox\u2019s stockholders on the Distribution Date over 21st Century Fox\u2019s tax basis in such shares. As described below, the Company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st Century Fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing.\nUnder the terms of the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement that the Company and 21st Century Fox entered into in connection with the Separation, the Company will, in certain circumstances, be responsible for all taxes, including interest and penalties, and tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st Century Fox as a result of actions taken by the Company or any of its subsidiaries after the Separation. Specifically, in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken, or omitted to be taken, after the Separation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions (1) were inconsistent with any representation or covenant made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st Century Fox\u2019s tax counsel, (2) violated any representation or covenant made in the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement, or (3) the Company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected, after consultation with its advisors, could result in any such determination, the Company will be responsible for any tax-related liabilities incurred by 21st Century Fox as a result of such determination.\nThe Company Could Be Liable for Income Taxes Owed by 21st Century Fox.\nEach member of the 21st Century Fox consolidated group, which, prior to the Separation, included 21st Century Fox, the Company and 21st Century Fox\u2019s other subsidiaries, is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the Separation. Consequently, the Company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred, and not discharged, by any member of 21st Century Fox\u2019s consolidated group. The Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement requires 21st Century Fox to indemnify the Company for any such liability. Disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the IRS in amounts that the Company cannot quantify.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement May Restrict the Company From Acquiring or Owning Certain Types of Assets in the U.S.\nThe Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the ownership of radio and television broadcast stations, television broadcast networks and newspapers (the \u201cBroadcast Ownership Rules\u201d) and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest (the \u201cProgram Access Rules\u201d). Under the FCC\u2019s rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above, the Murdoch Family Trust\u2019s ownership interest in both the Company and 21st Century Fox following the Separation would generally result in each company\u2019s businesses and assets being attributable to the Murdoch Family Trust for purposes of determining compliance with the Broadcast Ownership Rules and the Program Access Rules. Consequently, the Company\u2019s future conduct, including its acquisition of any newspapers in the same local markets in which 21st Century Fox owns or operates television stations or the Company\u2019s acquisition of an ownership interest in a cable operator, may affect 21st Century Fox\u2019s ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with the Broadcast Ownership Rules, or may subject 21st Century Fox to the Program Access Rules. Therefore, the Company and 21st Century Fox agreed in the Separation and Distribution Agreement that if the Company acquires, after the Distribution Date, newspapers, radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the U.S. and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st Century Fox\u2019s business, then the Company will be required to take certain actions, including divesting assets, in order to permit 21st Century Fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules. In addition, the Company will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor, including a cable television operator, if such acquisition would subject 21st Century Fox to the Program Access Rules to which it is not then subject. This agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the Company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the Broadcast Ownership Rules or Program Access Rules and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st Century Fox\u2019s business.\nThe Indemnification Arrangements the Company Entered Into With 21st Century Fox in Connection With the Separation May Require the Company to Divert Cash to Satisfy Indemnification Obligations to 21st Century Fox.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other related agreements, 21st Century Fox agreed to indemnify the Company for certain liabilities, and the Company agreed to indemnify 21st Century Fox for certain liabilities. As a result, the Company could be required, under certain circumstances, to indemnify 21st Century Fox and its affiliates against certain liabilities to the extent such liabilities result from an action the Company or its affiliates take or from any breach of the Company or its affiliates\u2019 representations, covenants or obligations under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement or any other agreement the Company entered into in connection with the Separation. The diversion of cash that may occur if the Company is required to indemnify 21st Century Fox under these agreements could limit the Company\u2019s ability to grow its businesses or capitalize on acquisition opportunities.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s Directors and Officers May Have Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest Because of Their Equity Ownership in 21st Century Fox, and Certain of the Company\u2019s Officers and Directors May Have Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest Because They Also Serve as Officers and/or on the Board of Directors of 21st Century Fox, Which May Result in the Diversion of Corporate Opportunities to 21st Century Fox.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers own shares of 21st Century Fox\u2019s common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of 21st Century Fox, including K. Rupert Murdoch, who serves as the Company\u2019s Executive Chairman and Executive Chairman of 21st Century Fox, and Lachlan K. Murdoch, who serves as the Company\u2019s Co-Chairman and Executive Chairman of 21st Century Fox. This ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the Company and 21st Century Fox. For example, potential conflicts of interest could\narise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the Company and 21st Century Fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization, the Separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies, including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters. In addition to any other arrangements that the Company and 21st Century Fox may agree to implement, the Company and 21st Century Fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies.\nThe Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation acknowledges that the Company\u2019s directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including K. Rupert Murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the Company and 21st Century Fox), each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of 21st Century Fox and certain of its affiliates. The Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the Company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation) to 21st Century Fox instead of the Company. As 21st Century Fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation, the provisions in the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st Century Fox instead of the Company.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Market Price of the Company\u2019s Stock May Fluctuate Significantly.\nThe Company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the Company\u2019s quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operating results; (3) success or failure of the Company\u2019s business strategy; (4) the Company\u2019s ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the Company\u2019s business; (7) announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers; (8) announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the Company\u2019s ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (12) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and (13) overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions.\nCertain Provisions of the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws, Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement, Separation and Distribution Agreement and Delaware Law, the Company\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Stockholder Rights Agreement and the Ownership of the Company\u2019s Common Stock by the Murdoch Family Trust May Discourage Takeovers and the Concentration of Ownership Will Affect the Voting Results of Matters Submitted for Stockholder Approval.\nThe Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock. In particular, the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws provide for, among other things:\n\u2022\na dual class common equity capital structure;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting;\n\u2022\nspecial stockholders\u2019 meeting to be called only by the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that stockholders give the Company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the Board of Directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022\nthe requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws;\n\u2022\ncertain restrictions on the transfer of the Company\u2019s shares; and\n\u2022\nthe Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, Preferred Stock and Series Common Stock with such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable.\nIn addition, in connection with the Separation, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement, which it extended in June 2014 and again in June 2015. Pursuant to the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement, each outstanding share of the Company\u2019s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the Company additional shares of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then-outstanding Class B Common Stock without approval of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock immediately following the Separation. The stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the Company\u2019s voting common stock without the approval of its Board of Directors. The rights expire on June 18, 2018, except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement. Further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the Murdoch Family Trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class A Common Stock and approximately 38.4% of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock as of August 5, 2016, K. Rupert Murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the Murdoch Family Trust. K. Rupert Murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. Also, K. Rupert Murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock and less than one percent of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock as of August 5, 2016. Thus, K. Rupert Murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and approximately 39.4% of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock as of August 5, 2016. This concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the Company. Additionally, the ownership concentration of Class B Common Stock by the Murdoch Family Trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the Murdoch Family Trust will be adopted and proposals that the Murdoch Family Trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of Class B Common Stock. Furthermore, the adoption of the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent, unless the Company\u2019s Board of Directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the Murdoch Family Trust\u2019s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval.", "PERMNO": 13964, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "NWSA"}
