{"cik": "808461", "company": "GCI LIBERTY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only ones that relate to our businesses or our capitalization. The risks described below are considered to be the most material. However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFactors Relating to Our Corporate History and Structure\nThe historical financial information of our Company prior to the Transactions and the historical financial information of Holdco is not necessarily representative of our future financial position, future results of operations or future cash flows, nor does it reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been as a combined, stand-alone company during the periods presented.\nThe historical financial information of our Company as presented in our filings under the Exchange Act, including our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, made prior to the completion of the Transactions includes only the financial information of our pre-Transaction legacy operations (the \u201cpre-Transaction GCI financial information\u201d). Due to the treatment of a portion of the Transactions as a \u201creverse acquisition\u201d under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with GAAP, for accounting purposes, Holdco was considered to acquire GCI Liberty (the entity formerly known as GCI) in the Transactions. Therefore, the historical financial information of the Company is the historical financial information of HoldCo, and not the pre-Transaction GCI financial information. As a result, neither the current historical financial information of our Company nor the pre-Transaction GCI financial information is representative of our future financial position, future results of operations or future cash flows, nor do they reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been as a combined, stand-alone company, pursuing independent strategies, during the periods presented.\nGCI Liberty will conduct its operations to maintain its exclusion from the 40 Act, but nevertheless, may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nFollowing the completion of the Transactions, GCI Liberty is in the business of selling communications and entertainment services to subscribers, and its economic success will be based on its ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers. Further, the GCI Holdings operating subsidiaries are expected to generate substantially all of the cash flow of the consolidated GCI Liberty. GCI Liberty intends to continue to conduct its operations so that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the \u201c40 Act\u201d). To ensure that GCI Liberty does not become subject to regulation under the 40 Act, GCI Liberty may be limited in the type of assets that it may continue to own or acquire and, further, may need to dispose of or acquire certain assets (through a purchase, sale, merger or other transaction) at such times or on such terms as may be less favorable to GCI Liberty than if it were not required to enter into such transaction to maintain its exclusion from regulation under the 40 Act. If for any reason, however, GCI Liberty were to become subject to regulation under the 40 Act (such as due to significant accretion in the value of its interests in certain publicly traded securities coupled with a reduction in the value of the GCI Holdings operations or a change in circumstance which results in a reclassification of certain of its operating assets as investment securities for purposes of the 40 Act), after giving effect to any applicable grace periods, GCI Liberty may be required to register as an investment company, which could result in significant registration and compliance costs, could require changes to its corporate governance structure and financial reporting, and could restrict its activities going forward. In addition, if GCI Liberty were to become inadvertently subject to the 40 Act, any violation of the 40 Act could subject it to material adverse consequences, including potentially significant regulatory penalties and the possibility that certain of its contracts could be deemed unenforceable.\nFactors Relating to the Transactions\nWe may have a significant indemnity obligation to Qurate Retail if the GCI Liberty Split-Off is treated as a taxable transaction.\nIn connection with the contribution and Holdco Split-Off (together, the \u201cGCI Liberty Split-Off\u201d), Qurate Retail received an opinion of its tax counsel to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the GCI Liberty Split-Off would qualify as a tax-free transaction to Qurate Retail and to the former holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). In July 2018,\nI-13\nthe IRS completed its review of the GCI Liberty Split-Off and informed Qurate Retail that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transactions. Qurate Retail received an Issue Resolution Agreement from the IRS documenting this conclusion.\nEven if the GCI Liberty Split-Off otherwise qualifies under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D), and related provisions of the Code, the GCI Liberty Split-Off would result in a significant U.S. federal income tax liability to Qurate Retail (but not to the former holders of Liberty Ventures common stock) under Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50% or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in the stock of Qurate Retail or in the stock of our Company (excluding, for this purpose, the acquisition of our common stock by Qurate Retail and holders of Liberty Ventures common stock pursuant to the GCI Liberty Split-Off transactions) as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the GCI Liberty Split-Off. Any acquisition of the stock of Qurate Retail or our Company (or any successor corporation) within two years before or after the GCI Liberty Split-Off would generally be presumed to be part of a plan that includes the GCI Liberty Split-Off, although the parties may be able to rebut that presumption under certain circumstances. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel described above, Qurate Retail or we might inadvertently cause or permit a prohibited change in ownership of Qurate Retail or our Company, thereby triggering tax liability to Qurate Retail.\nPrior to the GCI Liberty Split-Off, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Qurate Retail. Under this agreement, Qurate Retail is generally responsible for any taxes and losses resulting from the failure of the GCI Liberty Split-Off to qualify as a tax-free transaction; however, we are required to indemnify Qurate Retail, its subsidiaries and certain related persons for any taxes and losses which (i) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by us (applicable to actions or failures to act by our Company and our subsidiaries following the completion of the GCI Liberty Split-Off), or (ii) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the GCI Liberty Split-Off as a result of the treatment of the GCI Liberty Split-Off as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50% or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in the stock of our Company (or any successor corporation). Our indemnification obligations to Qurate Retail, its subsidiaries, and certain related persons are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. If we are required to indemnify Qurate Retail, its subsidiaries, or such related persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the GCI Liberty Split-Off, we may determine to forego certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to our Company, including certain asset dispositions or other strategic transactions for some period of time following the GCI Liberty Split-Off. In addition, our indemnity obligation related to the GCI Liberty Split-Off under the tax sharing agreement might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control transaction for some period of time following the GCI Liberty Split-Off.\nOur Company has overlapping directors and management with Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband Corporation, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. and Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc., which may lead to conflicting interests.\nAs a result of the Transactions and other transactions between 2011 and 2016 that resulted in the separate corporate existence of Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (\u201cLiberty TripAdvisor\u201d) and Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. (\u201cLiberty Expedia\u201d), most of the executive officers of GCI Liberty also serve as executive officers of Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty TripAdvisor, Liberty Broadband and Liberty Expedia, and there are overlapping directors. With the exception of our Company\u2019s ownership of shares of Liberty Broadband's non-voting Series C common stock, none of these companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. Our executive officers and members of our Company\u2019s board of directors have fiduciary duties to our shareholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband, Liberty TripAdvisor or Liberty Expedia have fiduciary duties to that company's stockholders. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband, Liberty TripAdvisor, Liberty Expedia or GCI Liberty looks at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest in the event there are matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Moreover, most of our Company\u2019s directors and officers own GCI Liberty stock and equity awards and own Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband, Liberty TripAdvisor and Liberty Expedia stock and equity awards. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Any potential conflict that qualifies as a \u201crelated party transaction\u201d (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer's board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Each of Liberty\nI-14\nBroadband, Liberty TripAdvisor, Liberty Expedia and GCI Liberty has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities, and their respective certificate of incorporation provides that no director or officer of the respective company will breach their fiduciary duty and therefore be liable to the respective company or its stockholders by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband, Liberty TripAdvisor and Liberty Expedia and GCI Liberty, as the case may be) instead of the respective company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to the respective company, unless (x) such opportunity was expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the respective company or as a director or officer of any of the respective company\u2019s subsidiaries, and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of business in which the respective company or any of its subsidiaries is then directly engaged. Any other potential conflicts that may arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, GCI Liberty may enter into transactions with Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband, Liberty TripAdvisor and Liberty Expedia and/or their respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transaction will be as favorable to GCI Liberty, Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband, Liberty TripAdvisor and Liberty Expedia or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nThe market value of GCI Liberty's interests in publicly-traded securities may be affected by market conditions beyond its control that could cause it to record losses for declines in such market value.\nSubstantially all of the contributed HoldCo assets consist of equity interests in publicly-traded companies. The contributed HoldCo assets included shares of Charter valued at approximately $1.5 billion, as of December 31, 2018, and shares of Liberty Broadband, which is Charter's largest shareholder with a 25.01% voting interest in Charter, valued at approximately $3.1 billion, as of December 31, 2018. Our Company has no ability to exercise control over either Charter or Liberty Broadband, and therefore we cannot cause either investee to take actions which may be in the best interest of our Company and our investment in these companies. Although many of the risks described below relating to our operating business similarly affect Charter and Liberty Broadband, for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties specific to Charter and Liberty Broadband, holders of GCI Liberty securities should please see \u201cPart I-Item 1A. Risk Factors-Factors Relating to Our Corporate History and Structure\u201d and \u201cPart I-Item 1A. Risk Factors-Factors Relating to Charter\u201d of Liberty Broadband's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 8, 2019. In addition, as of the completion of the Transactions, the contributed HoldCo assets included an interest in the publicly traded equity of LendingTree with a market value of approximately $756.2 million, as of December 31, 2018. The value of these interests may be affected by economic and market conditions that are beyond our control, and our ability to liquidate or otherwise monetize these interests without adversely affecting their value may be limited.\nFactors Relating to Our GCI Holdings' Business and Future Results\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect the business operations of GCI Holdings, which we refer to as \"GCI\" in the following risk factors relating to the business of GCI Holdings. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nGCI faces competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\nThere is substantial competition in the telecommunications and entertainment industries. Through mergers, various service integration strategies, and business alliances, major providers are striving to strengthen their competitive positions. GCI faces increased wireless services competition from national carriers in the Alaska market and increasing video services competition from DBS providers and over-the-top content providers who are often able to offer more flexible subscription packages and exclusive content.\nWe expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products. We cannot predict which of many possible future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain GCI\u2019s competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services. GCI\u2019s ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on its ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors. To the extent GCI does not keep pace with technological advances or fails to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in its industry and in its markets, GCI could lose market share or experience a decline in its revenue and net income. Competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services. Competitive pressures also create challenges for its ability to grow\nI-15\nnew businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute its business plan. GCI also faces the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect its market share and gross margins.\nGCI\u2019s wholesale customers including its major roaming customers may construct facilities in locations where they contract with GCI to use its network to provide service on their behalf. We would experience a decline in revenue and net income if any of GCI\u2019s wholesale customers constructed or expanded their existing networks in places where service is provided on GCI\u2019s network. Some of GCI\u2019s wholesale customers have greater access to financial, technical, and other resources than it does. GCI expects to continue to offer competitive alternatives to such customers in order to retain significant traffic on its network. We cannot predict whether such negotiations will be successful. GCI\u2019s inability to negotiate such contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf GCI experiences low or negative rates of subscriber acquisition or high rates of turnover, our financial performance will be impaired.\nGCI is in the business of selling communications and entertainment services to subscribers, and its economic success is based on its ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers. If GCI is unable to retain and attract subscribers, its and our financial performance will be impaired. GCI\u2019s rates of subscriber acquisition and turnover are affected by a number of competitive factors including the size of its service areas, network performance and reliability issues, its device and service offerings, subscribers\u2019 perceptions of its services, and customer care quality. Managing these factors and subscribers\u2019 expectations is essential in attracting and retaining subscribers. Although GCI has implemented programs to attract new subscribers and address subscriber turnover, we cannot assure you that these programs or GCI\u2019s strategies to address subscriber acquisition and turnover will be successful. A high rate of turnover or low or negative rate of new subscriber acquisition would reduce revenue and increase the total marketing expenditures required to attract the minimum number of subscribers required to sustain GCI\u2019s business plan which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGCI may be unable to obtain or maintain the roaming services it needs from other carriers to remain competitive.\nSome of GCI\u2019s competitors have national networks that enable them to offer nationwide coverage to their subscribers at a lower cost than GCI can offer. The networks GCI operates do not, by themselves, provide national coverage and GCI must pay fees to other carriers who provide roaming services to it. GCI currently relies on roaming agreements with several carriers for the majority of its roaming services.\nThe FCC requires commercial mobile radio service providers to provide roaming, upon request, for voice and SMS text messaging services on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The FCC also requires carriers to offer data roaming services. The rules do not provide or mandate any specific mechanism for determining the reasonableness of roaming rates for voice, SMS text messaging or data services and require that roaming complaints be resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on a non-exclusive list of factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of particular conduct or rates. If GCI were to lose the benefit of one or more key roaming or wholesale agreements unexpectedly, it may be unable to obtain similar replacement agreements and as a result may be unable to continue providing nationwide voice and data roaming services for its customers or may be unable to provide such services on a cost-effective basis. GCI\u2019s inability to obtain new or replacement roaming services on a cost-effective basis may limit its ability to compete effectively for wireless customers, which may increase its turnover and decrease its revenue, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGCI\u2019s business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation. Applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nWireless Services. The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to:\n\u2022\nHow radio spectrum is used by licensees;\n\u2022\nThe nature of the services that licensees may offer and how such services may be offered; and\n\u2022\nResolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.\nAlthough the Communications Act preempts state and local regulation of market entry and the rates charged by commercial mobile radio service providers, states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and\nI-16\nconsumer-related issues. These regulations could increase the costs of GCI\u2019s wireless operations. The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation. FCC rules require all wireless licensees to meet certain build-out requirements and substantially comply with applicable FCC rules and policies and the Communications Act in order to retain their licenses. Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area. There is no guarantee that GCI\u2019s licenses will be renewed.\nCommercial mobile radio service providers must implement E911 capabilities in accordance with FCC rules. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with such FCC rules, the failure to deploy E911 service consistent with FCC requirements could subject us to significant fines.\nGCI uses tower facilities for the provision of its wireless services. The FCC, together with the FAA, also regulates tower marking and lighting. In addition, tower construction is affected by federal, state and local statutes addressing zoning, environmental protection and historic preservation. The FCC requires local notice in any community in which an applicant is seeking FCC antenna structure registration to build a tower. Local notice provides members of the community with an opportunity to comment on or challenge the tower construction for environmental reasons. This rule could cause delay for certain tower construction projects.\nInternet Services. In 2015, the FCC adopted an order reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. The order prohibited broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic, and from unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging end users' and edge providers' ability to send traffic to, from, and among each other. The order also strengthened the FCC's transparency rules, which require accurate and truthful service disclosures, sufficient for consumers to make informed choices, for example, about speed, price and fees, latency, and network management practices. The order allowed broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management, including using techniques to address traffic congestion. The new rules applied equally to wired and wireless broadband services. The order refrained from imposing rate regulation or tariff requirements on broadband services.\nOn January 4, 2018, the FCC released an order that returned to a Title I classification of Internet service and eliminated many of the requirements described above. There are various efforts in Congress, through the federal courts of appeal, and through state legislation to re-impose net neutrality requirements or some variation thereof. For example, on September 30, 2018, California enacted the California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018, which establishes many of the requirements adopted by the FCC in 2015. California has agreed not to enforce the new law pending the resolution of a petition for review of the FCC\u2019s January 4, 2018 order in the D.C. Circuit, and any subsequent proceedings before the U.S. Supreme Court. We cannot predict whether the FCC or Congress will re-impose the 2015 rules or some variation thereof. It is possible that the FCC could interpret or apply any re-imposed rules in a way that has a material adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\nVideo Services. The cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels, and various aspects of such regulation often are the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals. It is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of GCI in the future.\nOther existing federal regulations, currently the subject of judicial, legislative, and administrative review, could change, in varying degrees, the manner in which video systems operate. Neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact on the cable television industry in general, or on GCI\u2019s activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular, can be predicted at this time. There can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by Congress, the FCC or other federal, state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nLocal Access Services. GCI\u2019s success in the local telephone market depends on its continued ability to obtain interconnection, access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services. GCI\u2019s ability to provide service in the local telephone market depends on its negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier\u2019s existing local telephone network (in some Alaska markets at cost-based rates), to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way, to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier, and in some cases, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to unbundled network elements. Future negotiations or arbitration proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in GCI\u2019s cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers or via wholesale offerings. GCI\u2019s local telephone services business faces the risk of unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations.\nI-17\nLoss of GCI\u2019s ETC status would disqualify it for USF support.\nThe USF pays support to ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline and wireless telephone service in high cost areas. If GCI were to lose its ETC status in any of the study areas where it is currently an authorized ETC whether due to legislative or regulatory reform or its failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, GCI would be ineligible to receive USF support for providing service in that area. Loss of ETC status could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nRevenue and accounts receivable from USF support may be reduced or lost.\nGCI receives support from each of the various USF programs: high cost, low income, rural health care, and schools and libraries. This support was 23% of the Company's revenue for the period following the date of the Transactions through December 31, 2018. The support received by pre-Transaction GCI during prior years was comparable. GCI had USF net receivables of $91 million at December 31, 2018. The USF programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC, interpretations of or compliance with USF program rules, or legislative actions. Changes to any of the USF programs that GCI participates in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could have an adverse effect on GCI's business and the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nIn November 2017, USAC requested further information in support of the rural rates charged to a number of our RHC customers in connection with the funding requests for the year that runs July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018. On October 10, 2018, GCI received a letter from the Bureau notifying it of the Bureau\u2019s decision to reduce the rural rates charged to RHC customers for the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018 by approximately 26% resulting in a reduction of total support payments of $27.8 million. The FCC also informed GCI that the same cost methodology used for the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018 would be applied to rates charged to RHC customers in subsequent funding years. In response to the letter from the Bureau, GCI filed an Application for Review of the Bureau\u2019s decision with the FCC. In the third quarter of 2018, GCI recorded a $19.1 million reduction in its receivables balance as part of its acquisition accounting and recorded a reduction in revenue in the current period for the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018 of approximately $8.6 million. GCI expects to reduce future RHC program revenue by a similar rate as to the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018, which based on a current run rate would approximate $7 million per quarter until it can reach a final resolution with the FCC regarding the funding amounts.\nOn March 15, 2018, USAC announced that the funding requests for the year that runs July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 exceeded the funding available for the RHC Program. Since that time, on June 25, 2018, the FCC issued an order resulting in an increase of the annual RHC Program funding cap from $400 million to $571 million and applied it to the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018. The FCC also determined that it would annually adjust the RHC Program funding cap for inflation, beginning with the funding year ending on June 30, 2019 and carry-forward unused funds from past funding years for use in future funding years. As a result, aggregate funding was available to pay in full the approved funding under the RHC program for the funding year ended on June 30, 2018.\nIn addition, on March 23, 2018, GCI received a separate letter of inquiry and request for information from the Enforcement Bureau of the FCC, to which it is in the process of responding. This inquiry into the rates charged by GCI is still pending, and presently it is unable to assess the ultimate resolution of this matter. The ongoing uncertainty in program funding could have an adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nOn November 30, 2018, GCI received multiple funding denial notices from USAC, denying requested funding from the RHC Program operated by a rural health customer (the \u201cCustomer\u201d) for the funding year that ended on June 30, 2018. At the rates approved by the Bureau in a letter received on October 10, 2018, the funding at issue under the denials is approximately $13 million. In November 2017, USAC requested information from the Customer related to bidding process documentation for two separate service contracts GCI has with the Customer. Although the Customer timely responded, USAC found that bids previously received were not submitted with the original funding request and/or that bidding information submitted was related to the wrong bidding year. The Customer filed an appeal with USAC on January 29, 2019. At this time, GCI has no reason to believe that there was any violation of the FCC\u2019s competitive bidding rules, but without further information from the Customer and/or USAC, it cannot assess whether the USAC denials will be overturned. If the denial notices are upheld for reasons relating to the Customer\u2019s competitive bidding process, funding issued under one or both contracts for prior years could be subject to further review, as well as funding for services already being delivered or to be delivered for the period from July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019. GCI has accounts receivable of approximately $18 million outstanding as of December 31, 2018 associated with these two service contracts. The outstanding accounts receivable includes\nI-18\nthe approximate $13 million of funding at issue as discussed above and additional amounts for services provided for the period from July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. Given the uncertainty of whether the USAC denials will be overturned, it is reasonably possible that GCI may incur a loss. The amount of a potential loss could range from zero to the full amount of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2018. No amount within this range of a potential loss is a better estimate than any other amount. Accordingly, no loss was recorded as of December 31, 2018 given the minimum amount in the range is zero.\nIn addition, on December 4, 2018, the FCC issued a public notice seeking further comment on an earlier proposal to determine the rural rates for services supported by the RHC Program in a different manner than it does today. GCI and others submitted comments on January 30, 2019, but GCI cannot assess at this time the substance, impact on funding, or timing of any future rule changes that may be adopted by the FCC.\nGCI may not meet its performance plan milestones under the Alaska High Cost Order.\nAs an ETC, GCI receives support from the USF to support the provision of wireline local access and wireless service in high cost areas. On August 31, 2016, the FCC published the Alaska High Cost Order which requires GCI to submit to the FCC a performance plan with five-year and ten-year commitments. If GCI is unable to meet the final performance plan milestones approved by the FCC it will be required to repay 1.89 times the average amount of support per location received over the ten-year term for the relevant number of locations that GCI failed to deploy to, plus ten percent of its total Alaska High Cost Order support received over the ten-year term. Inability to meet GCI\u2019s performance plan milestones could have an adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nGCI may lose USF high cost support if another carrier adds 4G LTE service in an area where it currently provides 4G LTE service.\nUnder the Alaska High Cost Order, the FCC adopted a process for revisiting after five years whether and to what extent there is duplicative support for 4G LTE service in rural Alaska and to take steps to eliminate such duplicative support levels in the second half of the ten-year term. As a result, if another carrier builds 4G LTE service in an area where GCI is the sole provider and the FCC decides to redistribute the support then GCI\u2019s high cost support may be reduced, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nProgramming expenses for GCI\u2019s video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe expect programming expenses for GCI\u2019s video services to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming and costs to retransmit local broadcast stations. As GCI\u2019s contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case GCI may be unable to provide such content as part of its video services and our business could be adversely affected. If GCI adds programming to its video services or if GCI chooses to distribute existing programming to its customers through additional delivery platforms, GCI may incur increased programming expenses. If GCI is unable to raise its customers\u2019 rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe decline in GCI\u2019s voice services\u2019 results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, may accelerate.\nWe expect GCI\u2019s voice services\u2019 results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, will continue to decline. As competition from wireless carriers, such as GCI, increases we expect GCI\u2019s long-distance and local access services' subscribers and revenue will continue to decline and the rate of decline may accelerate.\nGCI may not be able to satisfy the requirements of its participation in a New Markets Tax Credit (\u201cNMTC\u201d) program for funding its TERRA project.\nGCI has entered into several arrangements under the NMTC program with US Bancorp to help fund various phases of its TERRA project. In connection with the NMTC transactions GCI received proceeds which were restricted for use on TERRA. The NMTCs are subject to 100% recapture of the tax credit for a period of seven years as provided in the Code. We are required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangements. We have agreed to indemnify US Bancorp for any loss or recapture of its $35.1 million in NMTCs plus interest and penalties until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved. Our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved in various stages\nI-19\nfrom October 2019 through December 2024. Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized by US Bancorp and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nFailure to stay abreast of new technology could affect GCI\u2019s ability to compete in the industry.\nGCI tests and deploys various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance its competitiveness and increase the utility of its services. As GCI\u2019s operations grow in size and scope, it must continuously improve and upgrade its systems and infrastructure while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of its systems and infrastructure. The emergence of alternative platforms such as mobile or tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology. GCI may not successfully complete the rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner, and they may not be widely accepted by GCI\u2019s customers or may not be profitable, in which case GCI could not recover its investment in the technology. There can be no assurance that GCI will be able to compete with advancing technology or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as it would like or in a cost effective manner. Deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of its networks with respect to both the new and existing services. Any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect GCI\u2019s ability to retain customers and may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, GCI must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If GCI is unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, GCI could experience reduced profits.\nGCI\u2019s operations are geographically concentrated in Alaska and are impacted by the economic conditions in Alaska.\nGCI offers products and services to customers primarily throughout Alaska. Because of this geographic concentration, growth of GCI\u2019s business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska. The economy of Alaska is dependent upon the oil industry, state government spending, United States military spending, investment earnings and tourism. Prolonged periods of low oil prices adversely impacts the Alaska economy, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the demand for GCI\u2019s products and services and on our results of operations and financial condition. Low oil prices have put significant pressure on the Alaska state government budget since the majority of its revenue come from the oil industry. While the Alaska state government has significant reserves that we believe could help fund the state government, budgetary reforms will need to be implemented in order to offset the impact of lower oil prices.\nThe Alaska economy is in a recession that started in late 2015. While it is difficult for us to predict the future impact of the continuing recession on GCI\u2019s business, these conditions have had an adverse impact on GCI\u2019s business and could continue to adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of its products and services and cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of its products and services. Additionally, its customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to GCI. If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase. If the recession continues, it could continue to negatively affect GCI\u2019s business including our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as our ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns.\nThe customer base in Alaska is limited and GCI has already achieved significant market penetration with respect to its service offerings in Anchorage and other locations in Alaska. GCI may not be able to continue to increase its share of the existing markets for its services, and no assurance can be given that the Alaskan economy will grow and increase the size of the markets GCI serves or increase the demand for the services it offers. The markets in Alaska for wireless and wireline telecommunications and video services are unique and distinct within the United States due to Alaska\u2019s large geographical size, its sparse population located in a limited number of clusters, and its distance from the rest of the United States. The expertise GCI has developed in operating its businesses in Alaska may not provide GCI with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets.\nNatural or man-made disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business.\nGCI\u2019s technical infrastructure (including our communications network infrastructure and ancillary functions supporting its network such as service activation, billing and customer care) is vulnerable to damage or interruption from technology failures, power surges or outages, natural disasters, fires, human error, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing or similar events. As a communications provider, there is an increased risk that GCI\u2019s technological infrastructure may be targeted in connection with terrorism or cyberattacks, either as a primary target, or as a means of facilitating additional attacks on other\nI-20\ntargets.\nIn addition, earthquakes, floods, fires and other unforeseen natural disasters or events could materially disrupt GCI\u2019s business operations or its provision of service in one or more markets. Specifically, the majority of GCI\u2019s facilities are located in areas with known significant seismic activity. Costs GCI incurs to restore, repair or replace its network or technical infrastructure, as well as costs associated with detecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use, may be substantial and increase GCI\u2019s cost of providing service. Many of the areas in which GCI operates have limited emergency response services and may be difficult to reach in an emergency situation. Should a natural disaster or other event occur, it could be weeks or longer before remediation efforts could be implemented, if they could be implemented at all. Further, any failure in or interruption of systems that GCI or third parties maintain to support ancillary functions, such as billing, point of sale, inventory management, customer care and financial reporting, could materially impact GCI\u2019s ability to timely and accurately record, process and report information important to our business. If any of the above events were to occur, GCI could experience higher churn, reduced revenue and increased costs, any of which could harm its reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, our insurance may not be adequate to cover the costs associated with a natural disaster or terrorist attack.\nCyberattacks or other network disruptions could have an adverse effect on GCI\u2019s business.\nCyberattacks against GCI\u2019s technological infrastructure or breaches of network information technology may cause equipment failures, disruption of its operations, and potentially unauthorized access to confidential customer data. Cyberattacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for service disruption or unauthorized access to confidential customer data, have increased in frequency, scope, and potential harm for businesses in recent years. It is possible for such cyberattacks to go undetected for an extended period of time, increasing the potential harm to GCI\u2019s customers, assets, and reputation.\nTo date, GCI has not been subject to cyberattacks or network disruptions that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to GCI\u2019s operations or financial condition. Nevertheless, GCI engages in a variety of preventive measures at an increased cost to GCI, in order to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and safeguard its infrastructure and confidential customer information. Such measures include, but are not limited to the following industry best practices: application whitelisting, anti-malware, message and spam filtering, encryption, advanced firewalls, threat detection, and URL filtering. Despite these preventive and detective actions, GCI\u2019s efforts may be insufficient to repel a major cyberattack or network disruption in the future.\nSome of the most significant risks to GCI\u2019s information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure include:\n\u2022\nCyberattacks that disrupt, damage, and gain unauthorized access to GCI\u2019s network and computer systems including data breaches caused by criminal or terrorist activities;\n\u2022\nUndesired human actions including intentional or accidental errors;\n\u2022\nMalware (including viruses, worms, cryptoware, and Trojan horses), software defects, unsolicited mass advertising, denial of service, ransomware, and other malicious or abusive attacks by third parties; and\n\u2022\nUnauthorized access to GCI\u2019s information technology, billing, customer care, and provisioning systems and networks and those of its vendors and other providers.\nIf hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to GCI\u2019s technology systems, networks, or infrastructure, they may be able to access, steal, publish, delete, misappropriate, modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential customer data. Moreover, additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential customer data. A network disruption (including one resulting from a cyberattack) could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access, theft, publishing, deletion, misappropriation, or modification to or of confidential customer data. Due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks, GCI may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access.\nThe costs imposed on us as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant. Among others, such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures, litigation, fines, and sanctions, lost revenue from business interruption, and damage to the public\u2019s perception regarding our ability to provide a secure service. As a result, a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nI-21\nIncreases in data usage on GCI\u2019s wired and wireless networks may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for GCI\u2019s customers.\nVideo streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional Internet activity such as web browsing and email. As use of these services continues to grow, GCI\u2019s customers will likely use more bandwidth than in the past. Additionally, new wireless handsets and devices may place a higher demand for data on GCI\u2019s wireless network. If this occurs, GCI could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions, service degradation or slower transmission speeds for its customers. Alternatively, GCI could choose to implement network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, which could negatively affect its ability to retain and attract customers in affected areas. While we believe demand for these services may drive customers to pay for faster speeds, competitive or regulatory constraints may preclude GCI from recovering the costs of the necessary network investments which could result in an adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nProlonged service interruptions or system failures could affect GCI\u2019s business.\nGCI relies heavily on its network equipment, communications providers, data and software to support all of its functions. GCI relies on its networks and the networks of others for substantially all of its revenue. GCI is able to deliver services and serve its customers only to the extent that it can protect its network systems against damage from power or communication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other disruptions. While GCI endeavors to provide for failures in the network by providing back-up systems and procedures, GCI cannot guarantee that these back-up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency. Disruption to its billing systems due to a failure of existing hardware and backup protocols could have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow. Should GCI experience a prolonged failure, it could seriously jeopardize its ability to continue operations. In particular, should a significant service interruption occur, GCI\u2019s ongoing customers may choose a different provider, and its reputation may be damaged, reducing its attractiveness to new customers.\nIf failures occur in GCI\u2019s undersea fiber optic cable systems or GCI\u2019s TERRA facilities and its extensions, GCI\u2019s ability to immediately restore the entirety of GCI\u2019s service may be limited and we could incur significant costs.\nGCI\u2019s communications facilities include undersea fiber optic cable systems that carry a large portion of its traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states, one of which provides an alternative geographically diverse backup communication facility to the other. GCI\u2019s facilities also include TERRA and its extensions some of which are unringed, operating in a remote environment and are at times difficult to access for repairs. Damage to an undersea fiber optic cable system or TERRA and its extensions could result in significant unplanned expense. If a failure of both sides of the ring of GCI\u2019s undersea fiber optic facilities or GCI\u2019s ringed TERRA facility and its unringed extensions occurs and GCI is not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services GCI offers to its customers could be interrupted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nIf a failure occurs in GCI\u2019s satellite communications systems, GCI\u2019s ability to immediately restore the entirety of its service may be limited.\nGCI\u2019s communications facilities include satellite transponders that GCI uses to serve many rural and remote Alaska locations. Each of GCI\u2019s C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders are backed up using on-board transponder redundancy. In the event of a complete spacecraft failure the services are restored using capacity on other spacecraft that are held in reserve. If a failure of GCI\u2019s satellite transponders occurs and GCI is not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services GCI offers to its customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nGCI depends on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply communications equipment. If GCI does not obtain the necessary communications equipment, GCI will not be able to meet the needs of its customers.\nGCI depends on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply wireless, Internet, video and other telephony-related equipment. If GCI\u2019s providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet GCI\u2019s needs or provide them at an acceptable cost, GCI may not be able to satisfy demand for its services and competitors may fulfill this demand. Due to the unique characteristics of the Alaska communications markets (i.e., remote locations, rural, satellite-served, low density populations, and our leading edge services and products), in many situations GCI deploys and utilizes specialized, advanced technology and equipment that may not have a large market or demand. GCI\u2019s vendors may not succeed in\nI-22\ndeveloping sufficient market penetration to sustain continuing production and may fail. Vendor bankruptcy, or acquisition without continuing product support by the acquiring company, may require GCI to replace technology before its otherwise useful end of life due to lack of on-going vendor support and product development.\nThe suppliers and vendors on which GCI relies may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which GCI depends, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether GCI\u2019s business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect GCI\u2019s dependence on key suppliers to continue as they develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. The failure of GCI\u2019s key suppliers to provide products or product support could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nGCI does not have insurance to cover certain risks to which it is subject, which could lead to the occurrence of uninsured liabilities.\nAs is typical in the communications industry, GCI is self-insured for damage or loss to certain of its transmission facilities, including its buried, undersea and above-ground fiber optic cable systems. If GCI becomes subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities, our financial position, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.\nGCI recently completed the process of transferring its customer billing systems to a new third-party vendor. Any unanticipated difficulties, disruption or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial and reputational effects on our business.\nGCI recently implemented a new customer billing system, which involved moving to a new third-party billing services vendor and platform in 2018. Because the implementation was effected recently, the implementation may cause unforeseen major system or business disruptions. In addition, the third-party billing services vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact GCI and over which GCI may have limited control. Interruptions and/or failure of this new billing services system could disrupt GCI\u2019s operations and impact its ability to provide or bill for its services, retain customers, or attract new customers, and negatively impact overall customer experience. Any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage.\nConcerns about health/safety risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for GCI\u2019s wireless services.\nGCI does not manufacture devices or other equipment it sells, and GCI depends on its suppliers to provide defect-free and safe equipment. Suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria. However, even if the devices GCI sells meet the regulatory safety criteria, GCI could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products GCI sells if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects. We cannot guarantee that GCI will be fully protected against all losses associated with a product that is found to be defective.\nPortable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks, including cancer, due to radio frequency emissions from these devices. Purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed from time to time against other wireless companies seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase the cost of doing business. GCI cannot be sure of the outcome of any such cases or that the industry will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks. The actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect GCI through a reduction in subscribers. Further research and studies are ongoing, with no linkage between health risks and mobile phone use established to date by a credible public source. However, we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns.\nAdditionally, there are safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment. Concerns over any of these risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit GCI\u2019s ability to sell its wireless services.\nI-23\nRisk Related to Our Company as a Whole\nWe are a holding company with a substantial portion of our consolidated debt and other obligations held outside of our operating subsidiaries, and our ability to service that debt and such other obligations will require access to funds of our operating subsidiaries, which may be restricted.\nIn connection with the Transactions, our Company incurred substantial indebtedness, in addition to the indebtedness that GCI Liberty had outstanding prior to the completion of the Transactions, of $1.0 billion in term loan borrowings pursuant to the margin loan facility entered into by Broadband Holdco LLC (\u201cBroadband HoldCo\u201d), which margin loan facility includes the ability to request additional term loan facilities or increase the amount of the initial loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $300 million (the \u201cMargin Loan\u201d). Subsequently, in October 2018, Broadband Holdco entered into Amendment No. 1 (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to the Margin Loan (the \u201cMargin Loan Agreement\u201d). The Amendment established a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $200 million (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) and reduced the existing term loan credit facility under the Margin Loan Agreement to $800 million (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d and, together with Revolving Credit Facility, the \u201cMargin Loan Facility\u201d). The Margin Loan Facility is secured by a pledge of approximately 42.7 million shares of Series C common stock of Liberty Broadband, which constitutes all of the assets of Broadband Holdco. Following the Transactions, our indebtedness as it existed prior to the Transactions is held through GCI, LLC, an intermediate holding company of GCI Liberty that holds, in turn, all of the capital stock of GCI Liberty's legacy operating subsidiaries, as well as all of the contributed HoldCo assets, including Broadband Holdco. We expect that the GCI Holdings operating subsidiaries will generate substantially all of the cash flow of our consolidated company. As of December 31, 2018, the indebtedness of GCI, LLC consists of $900.0 million in borrowings under the Margin Loan Facility, $775.0 million in outstanding 6.75% senior notes due 2021 and the 6.875% senior notes due 2025 (together, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) and $715.1 million in outstanding term and revolving loans under a senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the \u201cSenior Credit Facility\u201d). In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the indebtedness of GCI Liberty includes $477.3 million of its outstanding 1.75% exchangeable senior debentures due 2046.\nQurate Retail, Liberty LLC, and GCI Liberty have entered into an indemnification agreement with the other parties thereto pursuant to which, among other things, (1) GCI Liberty will indemnify Liberty LLC with respect to any of Liberty LLCs 1.75% Exchangeable Debentures due 2046 (the \u201cLiberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures\u201d) surrendered for exchange to Liberty LLC on or before October 5, 2023 for the amount by which (i) the exchange value exceeds (ii) the sum of the adjusted principal amount of such Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures plus the amount of certain tax benefits attributable to such Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures so exchanged, and (2) Qurate Retail and GCI Liberty will indemnify each other with respect to certain potential losses in respect of the HoldCo Split-Off.\nThe ability of GCI Liberty, GCI, LLC, and Broadband Holdco to service their respective financial obligations will depend on their ability to access cash. The ability of GCI Liberty or GCI, LLC to access the cash of GCI Liberty's legacy operating subsidiaries will depend on those subsidiaries individual operating results and any statutory or regulatory restrictions. In addition, covenants included in GCI, LLC's Senior Notes and Senior Credit Facility will limit the ability of GCI, LLC to upstream cash to GCI Liberty or downstream cash to Broadband Holdco for this purpose. For example, as of December 31, 2018, GCI, LLC exceeded the maximum leverage threshold, as measured by the terms of the Senior Notes, and therefore does not have access to any additional funding under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility. GCI Liberty's other potential sources of cash include its available cash balances, dividends and interest from its investments, monetization of the public investment portfolio contributed to GCI Liberty in the Transactions, and proceeds from asset sales. There can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain the amounts of cash or marketable securities that we have.\nOur significant debt and lease obligations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and lease obligations including capital, operating, and the tower obligations (see note 15 of the Company's consolidated financial statements found in Part II of this report for additional information). Our high level of debt and lease obligations could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nIncreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nRequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nExposing us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent of any future borrowings at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nMaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\nI-24\n\u2022\nRestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nLimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product and service development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nLimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage may prevent us from exploiting.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and to meet other obligations. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. If we are unable to meet our future capital needs it may be necessary for us to curtail, delay or abandon our business growth plans. If we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans, it could cause a decline in our credit rating and could increase our borrowing costs or limit our ability to raise additional capital.\nWe will continue to require a significant amount of cash to satisfy our debt service requirements and to meet other obligations. As of December 31, 2018, we have outstanding approximately $2.9 billion of indebtedness on a consolidated basis. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash and to arrange additional financing in the future. These abilities are subject to, among other factors, our credit rating, our financial performance, general economic conditions, prevailing market conditions, the state of competition in our market, the outcome of certain legislative and regulatory issues and other factors that may be beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe terms of our debt obligations impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on the debt obligations.\nThe indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facility and other loans contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest. For example, as of December 31, 2018, GCI, LLC exceeded the maximum leverage threshold, as measured by the terms of the Senior Notes, and therefore does not have access to any additional funding under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility.\nThis restriction, along with these other covenants, may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply. A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures and/or the credit agreements. If there were an event of default under the indentures and/or the credit agreements, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately. Additionally, if we fail to repay the debt under the Senior Credit Facility when it becomes due, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility could proceed against certain of our assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries that we have pledged to them as security. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.\nWhen our Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, we may not be able to refinance or replace one or both.\nWhen our Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, we will likely need to refinance them and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. In addition, if the 6.75% senior notes due 2021 are not refinanced prior to December 3, 2020, the full principal revolving credit facility included in the Senior Credit Facility will mature on that date. If we are able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict our financial and operating flexibility.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flow could decrease.\nI-25\nIn order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, in the future, we may enter into derivative financial instruments, typically interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments. If we are unable to enter into interest rate swaps, it may adversely affect our cash flow and may impact our ability to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nAny significant impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would lead to a reduction in our net operating performance and a decrease in our assets.\nWe had $1.4 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2018, consisting of goodwill of $855.8 million, cable certificates of $305.0 million, wireless licenses of $190.0 million and other intangibles of $16.5 million. However, these valuations are not final and the acquisition price allocation is preliminary and subject to revision. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition. Our cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business. Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area.\nIf we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect our operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the goodwill and/or the indefinite-lived intangible assets, as appropriate, in the period in which the determination is made. The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies. Any changes to key assumptions, or actual performance compared with those assumptions, about our business and its future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value, resulting in an impairment charge.\nDue to certain market factors impacting GCI Holdings' operating results, impairment losses of $136 million and $65 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to goodwill and cable certificates, respectively, related to the GCI Holdings reporting unit. The fair value of the cable certificates and the GCI Holdings reporting unit was determined using an income approach (Level 3). As of December 31, 2018, accumulated goodwill impairment losses for GCI Holdings totaled $136 million.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had federal and state net operating losses and interest expense carryforwards of $153.9 million (on a tax effected basis) and, under the Code, we may carry forward these net operating losses in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code and related Treasury regulations at a time when our market capitalization is below a certain level, our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited. This limit could impact the timing of the usage of the net operating loss carryforwards, thus accelerating cash tax payments or causing net operating loss carryforwards to expire prior to their use, which could affect the ultimate realization of that deferred tax asset.\nWe have identified two material weaknesses in GCI Holdings\u2019 internal control over financial reporting, that, if not properly remediated, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As described in \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2018 due to the two material weaknesses at our wholly-owned subsidiary, GCI Holdings. The material weaknesses, at December 31, 2018, were identified at GCI Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary, as discussed below.\nI-26\n\u2022\nInformation technology general controls (\u201cITGCs\u201d) around financially significant information technology systems were not effective. Specifically, the ITGCs around system access were not operating consistently to ensure that access to applications and data was adequately restricted to appropriate personnel. Because of the deficiency in ITGCs for these systems, the business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on these systems were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. We believe that these control deficiencies were a result of an inadequate assessment of IT risks, which in turn contributed to inappropriate reliance on manual business process controls rather than ITGCs.\n\u2022\nInternal controls around the payroll processes were ineffective due to an aggregation of deficiencies relating to the IT deficiencies described above, ineffectively designed controls over payroll changes, and ineffective review and monitoring controls. We believe that these control deficiencies were a result of an inadequate assessment of risk related to outsourcing payroll processing to a third-party provider, which contributed to the ineffective design of controls intended to validate that manual changes to payroll inputs were appropriate.\nThe control deficiencies did not result in any identified misstatements.\nAs further described in \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d we and GCI Holdings have taken the necessary steps to remediate the material weakness, subsequent to the assessment date. However, as the reliability of the internal control process requires repeatable execution, the successful on-going remediation of these material weaknesses will require on-going training, monitoring and evidence of effectiveness prior to concluding that the controls are effective. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the remediation efforts will remain effective in the future or that additional or similar material weaknesses will not develop or be identified.\nImplementing any further changes to GCI Holdings\u2019 internal controls may distract its officers and employees and entail material costs to implement new processes and/or modify its existing processes. Moreover, these changes do not guarantee that we will be effective in maintaining the adequacy of GCI Holdings\u2019 internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could harm our business. In addition, investors\u2019 perceptions that GCI Holdings\u2019 internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm the price of our common stock.\nFactors Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; and\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign economic conditions.\nAlthough our Series B common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets, there is no meaningful trading market for the stock.\nOur Series B common stock is not widely held, with approximately 90% of the outstanding shares as of January 31, 2019 beneficially owned by John C. Malone, the Chairman of the board and a director of our Company. Although it is quoted on the OTC Markets, it is sparsely traded and does not have an active trading market. The OTC Markets tend to be highly illiquid, in part, because there is no national quotation system by which potential investors can track the market price of shares except through information received or generated by a limited number of broker-dealers that make markets in particular stocks. There is also a greater chance of market volatility for securities that trade on the OTC Markets as opposed to a national exchange or quotation system. This volatility is due to a variety of factors, including a lack of readily available price quotations, lower trading volume, absence of consistent administrative supervision of \u201cbid\u201d and \u201cask\u201d quotations, and market conditions. Each share of the Series B common stock is convertible, at any time at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock, which is listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cGLIBA.\u201d\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire our Company, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders.\nCertain provisions of our Company\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation (\u201crestated charter\u201d) and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions\nI-27\ninclude the following:\n\u2022\nauthorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;\n\u2022\nlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe existence of authorized and unissued stock, including \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of our Company;\n\u2022\nclassifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequiring shareholder approval by holders of at least 662/3% of our voting power or, in certain circumstances, the approval by at least 75% of the Board of Directors of GCI Liberty with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of GCI Liberty, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to the Company\u2019s restated charter.\nIn addition, John C. Malone currently beneficially owns shares representing the power to direct approximately 27.6% of the aggregate voting power in our Company, due to his beneficial ownership of approximately 90% of the outstanding shares of our Series B common stock as of January 31, 2019.", "PERMNO": 17334, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "GLIBA"}
