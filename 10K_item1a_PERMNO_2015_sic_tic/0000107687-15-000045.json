{"cik": "107687", "company": "WINNEBAGO INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-10-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face, but represent the most significant risk factors that we believe may adversely affect the RV industry and our business, operations or financial position. The risks and uncertainties discussed in this report are not exclusive and other risk factors that we may consider immaterial or do not anticipate may emerge as significant risks and uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCompetition\nThe market for RVs is very competitive. Competition in this industry is based upon price, design, value, quality and service. There can be no assurance that existing or new competitors will not develop products that are superior to our RVs or that achieve better consumer acceptance, thereby adversely affecting our market share, sales volume and profit margins. Some of our competitors are much larger than us, most notably in the towable RV market, which may provide them additional purchasing power. These competitive pressures may continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nHiring Constraints\nOur operations are dependent upon attracting and retaining skilled employees. Our motorhome operation is located in northern Iowa, a largely rural area. If we are unable to hire enough skilled employees to meet production demands or are unable to hire, motivate, retain and promote skilled personnel in all levels of our organization, we may be unable to develop and distribute products as effectively as might otherwise be achieved.\nGeneral Economic Conditions and Certain Other External Factors\nCompanies within the RV industry are subject to volatility in operating results due primarily to general economic conditions because the purchase of an RV is often viewed as a consumer luxury purchase. Specific factors affecting the RV industry include:\n\u2022\noverall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending;\n\u2022\nemployment trends;\n\u2022\nthe adverse impact of global tensions on consumer spending and travel-related activities; and\n\u2022\nadverse impact on margins of increases in raw material costs which we are unable to pass on to customers without negatively affecting sales.\nDependence on Credit Availability and Interest Rates to Dealers and Retail Purchasers\nOur business is affected by the availability and terms of the financing to dealers. Generally, RV dealers finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions. Three financial flooring institutions held 67% of our total financed dealer inventory dollars that were outstanding at August 29, 2015. In the event that any of these lending institutions limit or discontinue dealer financing, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In April 2015, General Electric (\u201cGE\u201d), announced its intention to sell the majority of GE Capital, including GE Commercial Distribution Finance, a major provider of floorplan financing for RV dealers. The ultimate outcome and impact of a sale or divestiture of GE Capital by GE is currently unknown.\nOur business is also affected by the availability and terms of financing to retail purchasers. Retail buyers purchasing a motorhome or towable may elect to finance their purchase through the dealership or a financial institution of their choice. Substantial increases in interest rates or decreases in the general availability of credit for our dealers or for the retail purchaser may have an adverse impact upon our business and results of operations.\nCyclicality and Seasonality\nThe RV industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand, reflecting prevailing economic and demographic conditions, which affect disposable income for leisure-time activities. Consequently, the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period.\nSeasonal factors, over which we have no control, also have an effect on the demand for our products. Demand in the RV industry generally declines over the winter season, while sales are generally highest during the spring and summer months. Also, unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand. Our business also does well when the US housing market is strong and our business weakens when the US housing market weakens.\nPotential Loss of a Large Dealer Organization\nOne of our dealer organizations accounted for 17.9% of our net revenue for Fiscal 2015, as they sold our products in 75 of their dealership locations across 28 US states. A second dealer organization accounted for 15.0% of our net revenue for Fiscal 2015, as they sold products in 11 of their dealership locations across 4 US states. The loss of either or both of these dealer organizations could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, deterioration in the liquidity or creditworthiness of either or both of these dealers could negatively impact our sales and could trigger repurchase obligations under our repurchase agreements.\nPotential Repurchase Liabilities\nIn accordance with customary practice in the RV industry, upon request we enter into formal repurchase agreements with lending institutions financing a dealer's purchase of our products. In these repurchase agreements we agree, in the event of a default by an independent dealer in its obligation to a lender and repossession of the unit(s) by the lending institution, to repurchase units at declining prices over the term of the agreements, which can last up to 18 months. The difference between the gross repurchase price and the price at which the repurchased product can then be resold, which is typically at a discount to the gross repurchase price, represents a potential expense to us. In certain instances, we also repurchase inventory from our dealers due to state law or regulatory requirements that govern voluntary or involuntary terminations. We also have agreed to repurchase certain units that we sell to a rental company. If we are obligated to repurchase a substantially larger number of RVs in the future, this would increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nFuel Availability and Price Volatility\nGasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of motorized RVs. There can be no assurance that the supply of these petroleum products will continue uninterrupted or that the price or tax on these petroleum products will not significantly increase in the future. RVs, however, are not generally purchased for fuel efficiency. Fuel shortages and substantial increases in fuel prices have had a material adverse effect on the RV industry as a whole in the past and could have a material adverse effect on us in the future.\nDependence on Suppliers\nMost of our RV components are readily available from numerous sources. However, a few of our components are produced by a small group of suppliers. In the case of motorhome chassis, Ford Motor Company, Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation, Mercedes-Benz (USA and Canada) and FCA (US and Canada) are our major suppliers. Our relationship with our chassis suppliers is similar to our other supplier relationships in that no special contractual commitments are engaged in by either party. This means that we do not have minimum purchase requirements and our chassis suppliers do not have minimum supply requirements. Our chassis suppliers also supply to our competitors. Historically, chassis suppliers resort to an industry-wide allocation system during periods when supply is restricted. These allocations have been based on the volume of chassis previously purchased. Sales of motorhomes rely on chassis supply and are affected by shortages from time to time. Decisions by our suppliers to decrease production, production delays, or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers, or price increases could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce motorhomes and ultimately, on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWarranty Claims\nWe receive warranty claims from our dealers in the ordinary course of our business. Although we maintain reserves for such claims, which to date have been adequate, there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate. A significant increase in warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition to the costs associated with the contractual warranty coverage provided on our products, we also occasionally incur costs as a result of additional service actions not covered by our warranties, including product recalls and customer satisfaction actions. Although we estimate and reserve for the cost of these service actions, there can be no assurance that expense levels will remain at current levels or such reserves will continue to be adequate.\nProtection of our Brand\nWe believe that one of the strengths of our business is our brand which is widely known around the world. We vigorously defend our brand and our other intellectual property rights against third parties on a global basis. We have, from time to time, had to bring claims against third parties to protect or prevent unauthorized use of our brand. If we are unable to protect and defend our brand or other intellectual property, it could have a material adverse affect on our results or financial condition.\nProduct Liability\nWe are subject, in the ordinary course of business, to litigation including a variety of warranty, \"Lemon Law\" and product liability claims typical in the RV industry. Although we have an insurance policy with a $35 million limit covering product liability, we are self-insured for the first $2.5 million of product liability claims on a per occurrence basis, with a $6.0 million aggregate. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any increase in the frequency and size of these claims, as compared to our experience in prior years, may cause the premium that we are required to pay for insurance to rise significantly. Product liability claims may also cause us to pay punitive damages, not all of which are covered by our insurance. In addition, if product liability claims rise to a level of frequency or size that are significantly higher than similar claims made against our competitors, our reputation and business may be harmed.\nInformation Systems and Web Applications\nWe rely on our information systems and web applications to support our business operations, including but not limited to procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, warranty administration, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems to report and audit our operational results. Additionally, we rely upon information systems in our sales, marketing, human resources and communication efforts. Due to our reliance on our information systems, our business processes may be negatively impacted in the event of substantial disruption of service. Further, misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of privacy laws and damage our reputation which could, in turn, have a negative impact on our results.\nData Security\nWe have security systems in place with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our customers', clients' and suppliers' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection, theft or loss of physical media. These include, for example, the appropriate encryption of information. Despite such efforts, we are subject to breach of security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities or the information we are trying to protect. Because the technologies used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly changing and becoming increasingly more sophisticated and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures. If unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations. Some regulations govern the manufacture and sale of our products, including the provisions of the MVA, and the safety standards for RVs and components which have been established under the Motor Vehicle Act by the Department of Transportation. The MVA authorizes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles which contain certain hazards or defects. Any major recalls of our vehicles, voluntary or involuntary, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While we believe we are substantially in compliance with the foregoing laws and regulations as they currently exist, amendments to any of these regulations or the implementation of new regulations could significantly increase the cost of manufacturing, purchasing, operating or selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of sales or production or cessation of operations.\nWe are also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation and marketing of motor vehicles, including so-called \"Lemon Laws.\" Federal and state laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight, length and width of motor vehicles, including motorhomes that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions.\nFailure to comply with NYSE and SEC laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, amendments to these regulations and the implementation of new regulations could increase the cost of manufacturing, purchasing, operating or selling our products and therefore could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe SEC adopted rules pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act setting forth new disclosure requirements concerning the use or potential use of certain minerals, deemed conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements necessitate due diligence efforts on our part to assess whether such minerals are used in our products in order to make the relevant required disclosures that began in May 2014. We incurred costs and diverted internal resource to comply with these new disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of those minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products. Compliance costs may increase in future periods. We may face reputational challenges that could impact future sales if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products.\nFinally, federal and state authorities also have various environmental control standards relating to air, water, noise pollution and hazardous waste generation and disposal which affect us and our operations. Failure by us to comply with present or future laws and regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of production or operations, alterations to the manufacturing process, or costly cleanup or capital expenditures, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nAnti-takeover Effect\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation, by-laws, the Iowa Business Corporation Act and provisions in our credit facilities and certain of our compensation programs that we may enter into from time to time could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial by our shareholders. The combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 51086, "SIC": 3790, "TIC": "WGO"}
