{"cik": "914475", "company": "NEUROCRINE BIOSCIENCES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following information sets forth risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those we may make from time to time. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be harmed. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also affect our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nWe have never obtained regulatory approval for a drug and we may be unable to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approval for INGREZZA or any of our other product candidates.\nWe have never obtained regulatory approval for a drug. Securing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. It is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may refuse to accept our New Drug Application (NDA) (or corresponding application) for substantive review or may conclude after review of our data that our application is insufficient to obtain regulatory approval of INGREZZA or any of our other product candidates. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with federal and state statutes and regulations require spending substantial time and financial resources.\nThe FDA may choose not to approve our NDA for INGREZZA and instead issue a Complete Response Letter for any of a variety of reasons, including a decision related to the safety or efficacy data for INGREZZA or for any other issues that they may identify related to our development of INGREZZA for the treatment of TD.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for INGREZZA or any of our other product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022\nfines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u2022\nproduct injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of INGREZZA or any of our other product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any of our potential products, we must subject these product candidates to extensive preclinical and clinical testing to demonstrate their safety and efficacy for humans. Clinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and may take years to complete.\nIn connection with the clinical trials of our product candidates, we face the risks that:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or similar foreign regulatory authority may not approve an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application or foreign equivalent filings required to initiate human clinical studies for our drug candidates or the FDA may require additional preclinical or clinical studies as a condition of the initiation of Phase I clinical studies, progression from Phase I to Phase II, or Phase II to Phase III, or for NDA approval;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate may not prove to be effective or as effective as other competing product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may discover that a product candidate may cause harmful side effects or results of required toxicology studies may not be acceptable to the FDA;\n\u2022\nthe results may not replicate the results of earlier, smaller trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may require use of new or experimental endpoints that may prove insensitive to treatment effects;\n\u2022\nwe or the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may suspend the trials;\n\u2022\nthe results may not be statistically significant;\n\u2022\npatient recruitment may be slower than expected;\n\u2022\npatients may drop out of the trials; and\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements may change.\nThese risks and uncertainties impact all of our clinical programs. Specifically, our VMAT2 inhibitor program will be impacted if any of the events above lead to delayed timelines for the enrollment in, or completion of, clinical trials of INGREZZA for tardive dyskinesia or Tourette syndrome. Similarly, with respect to our gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) program with AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie), any of the clinical, regulatory or operational events described above could delay timelines for the completion of the Phase III endometriosis program or the Phase III uterine fibroids program. Additionally, any of these events described above could result in suspension of a program and/or obviate any filings for necessary regulatory approvals.\nIn addition, late stage clinical trials are often conducted with patients having the most advanced stages of disease. During the course of treatment, these patients can die or suffer other adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agent being tested but which can nevertheless adversely affect clinical trial results. Any failure or substantial delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates may severely harm our business.\nEven if the clinical trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our\nproduct candidates for approval. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, approval of our product candidates may be significantly delayed, or we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates.\nIf we receive regulatory approval from the FDA for INGREZZA, we will depend on a single source supplier for each of the production of INGREZZA and its active pharmaceutical ingredients. The loss of either of these suppliers, or delays or problems in the supply of INGREZZA, could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize INGREZZA.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of process controls required to consistently produce the active pharmaceutical ingredients and the finished product in sufficient quantities while meeting detailed product specifications on a repeated basis. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products may encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, process controls, quality control and quality assurance, including testing of stability, impurities and impurity levels and other product specifications by validated test methods, and compliance with strictly enforced U.S., state and non-U.S. regulations. If we receive regulatory approval from the FDA for INGREZZA, and our third party suppliers for INGREZZA encounter these or any other manufacturing, quality or compliance difficulties, we may be unable to meet commercial demand for INGREZZA, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize INGREZZA.\nIn addition, if we receive regulatory approval from the FDA for INGREZZA and our suppliers fail or refuse to supply us with INGREZZA or its active pharmaceutical ingredient for any reason; it would take a significant amount of time and expense to qualify a new supplier. The FDA and similar international regulatory bodies must approve manufacturers of the active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials used in pharmaceutical products. The loss of a supplier could require us to obtain regulatory clearance and to incur validation and other costs associated with the transfer of the active pharmaceutical ingredients or product manufacturing processes. If there are delays in qualifying new suppliers or facilities or a new supplier is unable to meet FDA or similar international regulatory body\u2019s requirements for approval, there could be a shortage of INGREZZA.\nWe have limited marketing experience and no sales force, and have only recently begun establishing our distribution and reimbursement capabilities, and if our products are approved, we may not be able to commercialize them successfully.\nAlthough we do not currently have any marketable products, our ability to produce revenues ultimately depends on our ability to sell our products and secure adequate third-party reimbursement if and when they are approved by the FDA. We currently have limited experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products, have no sales force established to sell pharmaceutical products and have only recently begun establishing our distribution and reimbursement capabilities, all of which will be necessary to successfully commercialize any product candidate approved by the FDA. While we have recently hired personnel and engaged consultants with experience marketing and selling pharmaceutical products, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to establish the personnel, systems, arrangements and capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize any product candidate approved by the FDA. If we fail to establish successful marketing, sales and reimbursement capabilities or fail to enter into successful marketing arrangements with third parties, our product revenues may suffer.\nWe have no manufacturing capabilities. If third-party manufacturers of our product candidates fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our concerns, or if their performance is substandard, our clinical trials and product introductions may be delayed and our costs may rise.\nWe have in the past utilized, and intend to continue to utilize, third-party manufacturers to produce the drug compounds we use in our clinical trials and for the potential commercialization of our future products, including\nINGREZZA. We have limited experience in manufacturing products for commercial purposes and do not currently have any manufacturing facilities. Consequently, we depend on, and will continue to depend on, several contract manufacturers for all production of products for development and commercial purposes. If we are unable to obtain or retain third-party manufacturers, we will not be able to develop or commercialize our products. The manufacture of our products for clinical trials and commercial purposes is subject to specific FDA regulations, including current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. Our third-party manufacturers might not comply with FDA regulations relating to manufacturing our products for clinical trials and commercial purposes or other regulatory requirements now or in the future. Our reliance on contract manufacturers also exposes us to the following risks:\n\u2022\ncontract manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving volume production, quality control and quality assurance, and also may experience shortages in qualified personnel. As a result, our contract manufacturers might not be able to meet our clinical schedules or adequately manufacture our products in commercial quantities when required;\n\u2022\nswitching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nour contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to successfully produce, store or distribute our products; and\n\u2022\ndrug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and other agencies to ensure strict compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards.\nOur current dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our products may reduce our profit margin, if any, on the sale of our future products and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe depend on our current collaborators for the development and commercialization of our product candidates that we out-license and in-license, and may need to enter into future collaborations to develop and commercialize certain of our product candidates.\nOur strategy for fully developing and commercializing elagolix is dependent upon maintaining our current collaboration agreement with AbbVie. This collaboration agreement provides for significant future payments should certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones be achieved, and royalties on future sales of elagolix. Under this agreement, AbbVie is responsible for, among other things, conducting clinical trials and obtaining required regulatory approvals for elagolix; as well as manufacturing and commercialization of elagolix in the event it receives regulatory approval.\nBecause of our reliance on AbbVie, the development and commercialization of elagolix could be substantially delayed, and our ability to receive future funding could be substantially impaired, if AbbVie:\n\u2022\nfailed to gain the requisite regulatory approval of elagolix;\n\u2022\ndid not successfully launch and commercialize elagolix;\n\u2022\ndid not conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ndid not devote sufficient time and resources to our partnered program;\n\u2022\nterminated its agreement with us;\n\u2022\ndeveloped, either alone or with others, products that may compete with elagolix;\n\u2022\ndisputed our respective allocations of rights to any products or technology developed during our collaboration; or\n\u2022\nmerged with a third party that wants to terminate our agreement.\nIn March 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe to develop and commercialize INGREZZA in Japan and other select Asian markets. We will rely on Mitsubishi Tanabe to achieve certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones which, if achieved, could generate significant future revenue for us. Our collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe is subject to risks and uncertainties similar to those described above. In addition, we may need to enter into other out-licensing collaborations to assist in the development and commercialization of other product candidates we are developing now or may develop in the future, and any such future collaborations would be subject to similar risks and uncertainties.\nIn February 2017, we entered into a license agreement with BIAL for the development and commercialization of opicapone for the treatment of human diseases and conditions, including Parkinson\u2019s disease, in the United States and Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, we are responsible for the management of all opicapone development and commercialization activities; however, we will depend on BIAL to supply all drug product and investigation medicinal product for our development and commercialization activities. In addition, pursuant to the license agreement, the parties have established a joint steering committee with overall coordination and strategic oversight over activities under the agreement and to provide a forum for regular exchange of information, and BIAL has the right to co-promote licensed products during certain periods of time and to engage in certain marketing-related activities in cooperation with us. Accordingly, our strategy for developing and commercializing opicapone is dependent upon maintaining our current collaboration with BIAL. Because of our reliance on BIAL for certain aspects related to the development and commercialization of opicapone, any disagreement with BIAL, or BIAL\u2019s decision to not devote sufficient time and resources to our collaboration or to not conduct activities in a timely manner, could substantially delay and/or prohibit our ability to develop and commercialize opicapone.\nThese issues and possible disagreements with AbbVie, Mitsubishi Tanabe, BIAL or any future corporate collaborators could lead to delays in the collaborative research, development or commercialization of our product candidates. Furthermore, disagreements with these parties could require or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time-consuming and expensive. If any of these issues arise, it may delay the development and commercialization of drug candidates and, ultimately, our generation of product revenues.\nBecause the development of our product candidates is subject to a substantial degree of technological uncertainty, we may not succeed in developing any of our product candidates.\nAll of our product candidates are currently in research or clinical development with the exception of INGREZZA which is also in registration for TD. Only a small number of research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. Potential products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons. These reasons include the possibilities that the potential products may:\n\u2022\nbe found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfail to receive necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all;\n\u2022\nbe precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties;\n\u2022\nbe difficult to manufacture on a large scale; or\n\u2022\nbe uneconomical to commercialize or fail to achieve market acceptance.\nIf any of our products encounters any of these potential problems, we may never successfully market that product.\nWe do not and will not have access to all information regarding the product candidates we licensed to AbbVie.\nWe do not and will not have access to all information regarding the products being developed and potentially commercialized by AbbVie, including potentially material information about clinical trial design and execution, safety reports from clinical trials, spontaneous safety reports if a product candidate is later approved and marketed, regulatory affairs, process development, manufacturing, marketing and other areas known by AbbVie. In addition, we have confidentiality obligations under our agreement with AbbVie. Thus, our ability to keep our shareholders informed about the status of product candidates under our collaboration with AbbVie will be limited by the degree to which AbbVie keeps us informed and allows us to disclose such information to the public. If AbbVie fails to keep us informed about the clinical development and regulatory approval of our collaboration and product candidates licensed to it, we may make operational and investment decisions that we would not have made had we been fully informed, which may materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe have a history of losses and expect to incur negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve sustained profitability.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flow from operations. As a result of historical operating losses, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2016. We do not expect to be profitable, or generate positive cash flows from operations, for the year ending December 31, 2017.\nWe have not yet obtained regulatory approvals of any products and, consequently, have not generated revenues from the sale of products. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our drugs, we may not be profitable. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures as we:\n\u2022\nseek regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndevelop, formulate, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\nin-license or acquire new product development opportunities;\n\u2022\nimplement additional internal systems and infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nhire additional clinical, scientific, sales and marketing personnel.\nWe expect to experience negative cash flow in the coming years as we fund our operations, in-licensing or acquisition opportunities, and capital expenditures. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis. We may not be able to generate these revenues, and we may never achieve profitability on an annual basis in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability on an annual basis could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Even if we become profitable on an annual basis, we cannot assure you that we would be able to sustain or increase profitability on an annual basis.\nThe price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies historically have been highly volatile, and the market for these securities has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Over the course of the last 12 months, the price of our common stock has ranged from approximately $31.00 per share to approximately $56.00 per share. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe results of the FDA\u2019s review of our INGREZZA NDA for tardive dyskinesia;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning new and existing collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us or others;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions, including economic and market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ndevelopments related to the FDA;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\ncomments by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\ndevelopments related to on-going litigation;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation;\n\u2022\nhealth care reimbursement;\n\u2022\nfailure of any of our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success; and\n\u2022\npublic concern as to the safety of our drugs.\nBecause our operating results may vary significantly in future periods, our stock price may decline.\nOur quarterly revenues, expenses and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future. Our revenues are unpredictable and may fluctuate, among other reasons, due to our achievement of product development objectives and milestones, clinical trial enrollment and expenses, research and development expenses and the timing and nature of contract manufacturing and contract research payments. In addition, if we receive regulatory approval from the FDA for INGREZZA or any of our other product candidates, our revenues will fluctuate depending on our ability to sell our products and secure adequate third-party reimbursement. A high portion of our costs are predetermined on an annual basis, due in part to our significant research and development costs. Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter. Because of these factors, our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe license some of our core technologies and drug candidates from third parties. If we default on any of our obligations under those licenses, or violate the terms of these licenses, we could lose our rights to those technologies and drug candidates or be forced to pay damages.\nWe are dependent on licenses from third parties for some of our key technologies. These licenses typically subject us to various commercialization, reporting and other obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights. If we were to default on our obligations under any of our licenses, we could lose some or all of our rights to develop, market and sell products covered by these licenses. For example, BIAL may terminate our license agreement, pursuant to which we have rights to develop and commercialize opicapone, if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts, fail to file an NDA for a licensed product by a specified date, or otherwise breach the license agreement. In addition, if we were to violate any of the terms of our licenses, we could become subject to damages. For example, on December 1, 2015, The Mount Sinai School of Medicine of the City University of New York (Mount Sinai) filed a complaint against us, seeking unspecified monetary damages, future sublicensing fees and attorney\u2019s fees, alleging that we violated the terms of our license with Mount Sinai by inappropriately sublicensing Mount Sinai technology to AbbVie. While we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such claims, we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this action. Likewise, if we were to lose our rights under a license to use proprietary research tools, it could adversely affect our existing collaborations or adversely\naffect our ability to form new collaborations. We also face the risk that our licensors could, for a number of reasons, lose patent protection or lose their rights to the technologies we have licensed, thereby impairing or extinguishing our rights under our licenses with them.\nThe independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations that we rely upon to conduct our clinical trials may not be diligent, careful or timely, and may make mistakes, in the conduct of our trials.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations (CROs) to conduct our clinical trials under their agreements with us. The investigators are not our employees, and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. If our independent investigators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs, or if their performance is substandard, or not in compliance with Good Clinical Practices, it may delay or prevent the approval of our FDA applications and our introduction of new drugs. The CROs we contract with for execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of the trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. Failure of the CROs to meet their obligations could adversely affect clinical development of our products. Moreover, these independent investigators and CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If independent investigators and CROs assist our competitors at our expense, it could harm our competitive position.\nIf we cannot raise additional funding, we may be unable to complete development of our product candidates or establish commercial capabilities in the future.\nWe may require additional funding to continue our research and product development programs, to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials, for operating expenses and to pursue regulatory approvals for product candidates, for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims, if any, product in-licensing and any possible acquisitions, and we may require additional funding to establish manufacturing, marketing and commercialization capabilities in the future. We believe that our existing capital resources, together with investment income, and future payments due under our strategic alliances, will be sufficient to satisfy our current and projected funding requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, these resources might be insufficient to conduct research and development programs to the full extent currently planned. If we cannot obtain adequate funds, we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our research and development programs or obtain funds through additional arrangements with corporate collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\ncontinued scientific progress in our research and development programs;\n\u2022\nthe magnitude and complexity of our research and development programs;\n\u2022\nprogress with preclinical testing and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in filing and pursuing patent applications, enforcing patent claims, or engaging in interference proceedings or other patent litigation;\n\u2022\ncompeting technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of additional strategic alliances;\n\u2022\ndevelopments related to on-going litigation;\n\u2022\nthe cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, including manufacturing of our product candidates; and\n\u2022\nthe cost of product in-licensing and any possible acquisitions.\nWe intend to seek additional funding through strategic alliances, and may seek additional funding through public or private sales of our securities, including equity securities. For example, for so long as we continue to satisfy the requirements to be deemed a well-known seasoned issuer, we can file a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which will become automatically effective and will allow us to issue an unlimited number of shares of our common stock from time to time. In addition, we have previously financed capital purchases and may continue to pursue opportunities to obtain additional debt financing in the future. Additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. Any additional equity financings will be dilutive to our stockholders and any additional debt financings may involve operating covenants that restrict our business.\nIf we are unable to retain and recruit qualified scientists or if any of our key senior executives discontinues his or her employment with us, it may delay our development efforts or our preparations for the commercialization of INGREZZA or any other product candidate approved by the FDA.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. The loss of any of these people could impede the achievement of our objectives, including the successful commercialization of INGREZZA or any other product candidate approved by the FDA. Furthermore, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work in the future, along with personnel with experience marketing and selling pharmaceutical products, is critical to our success. We may be unable to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and health care companies, universities and non-profit research institutions for experienced scientists and individuals with experience marketing and selling pharmaceutical products. In addition, we rely on a significant number of consultants to assist us in formulating our research and development strategy and our commercialization strategy. Our consultants may have commitments to, or advisory or consulting agreements with, other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is commonplace in the biotechnology industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nGovernmental and third-party payors may impose sales and pharmaceutical pricing controls on our products or limit coverage and/or reimbursement for our products that could limit our product revenues and delay sustained profitability.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully, including INGREZZA, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available. The continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means may reduce our potential revenues. These payors\u2019 efforts could decrease the price that we receive for any products we may develop and sell in the future.\nAssuming we obtain coverage for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of our products. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new\ndrug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available regardless of whether they are approved by the FDA for that particular use.\nGovernment authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, such as by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. In addition, communications from government officials regarding health care costs and pharmaceutical pricing could have a negative impact on our stock price, even if such communications do not ultimately impact coverage or reimbursement decisions for our products.\nThere may also be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nIf physicians and patients do not accept INGREZZA or any of our other products, we may not recover our investment.\nThe commercial success of INGREZZA or any of our other products, if they are approved for marketing, will depend upon the acceptance of those products as safe and effective by the medical community and patients.\nThe market acceptance of INGREZZA or any of our other products could be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing of receipt of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nthe safety and efficacy of the products;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for the products;\n\u2022\nthe success of existing products addressing our target markets or the emergence of equivalent or superior products; and\n\u2022\nthe cost-effectiveness of the products.\nIn addition, market acceptance depends on the effectiveness of our marketing strategy, and, to date, we have very limited sales and marketing experience or capabilities. If the medical community and patients do not ultimately accept our products as being safe, effective, superior and/or cost-effective, we may not recover our investment.\nIf we receive regulatory approval from the FDA for INGREZZA or any of our other product candidates, we could face liability if a regulatory authority determines that we are promoting any such product for \u201coff-label\u201d uses.\nA company may not promote \u201coff-label\u201d uses for its drug products. An off-label use is the use of a product for an indication that is not described in the product\u2019s FDA-approved label in the United States or for uses in\nother jurisdictions that differ from those approved by the applicable regulatory agencies. Physicians, on the other hand, may prescribe products for off-label uses. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of drug treatment made in the physician\u2019s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. A company that is found to have promoted off-label use of its product, including INGREZZA, may be subject to significant liability, including civil and criminal sanctions. If we begin marketing any of our product candidates, we intend to comply with the requirements and restrictions of the FDA and other regulatory agencies with respect to our promotion of our products, but we cannot be sure that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will agree that we have not violated their restrictions. As a result, we may be subject to criminal and civil liability. In addition, our management\u2019s attention could be diverted to handle any such alleged violations. A significant number of companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various U.S. federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales practices, including the Department of Justice and various U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission and various state Attorneys General offices. These investigations have alleged violations of various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the federal False Claims Act, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. If the FDA or any other governmental agency initiates an enforcement action against us or if we are the subject of a qui tam suit and it is determined that we violated prohibitions relating to the promotion of products for unapproved uses, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal fines or damage awards and other sanctions such as consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements pursuant to which our activities would be subject to ongoing scrutiny and monitoring to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any such fines, awards or other sanctions would have an adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial prospects, and reputation.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, new SEC regulations and NASDAQ rules, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in some cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and management time related to compliance activities. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations and standards, our reputation may be harmed and we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nHealth care reform measures and other recent legislative initiatives could adversely affect our business.\nThe business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are affected by the efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care. In the United States, comprehensive health care reform legislation was enacted by the Federal government and we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government control over the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals. In addition, increasing emphasis on reducing the cost of health care in the\nUnited States will continue to put pressure on the rate of adoption and pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals. Moreover, in some foreign jurisdictions, pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is already subject to government control. Additionally, other recent federal and state legislation imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding distribution of the drug product. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, notification and purchaser license verification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.\nAdditionally, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are:\n\u2022\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u2022\na new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u2022\nextension of a manufacturer\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nSome of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges, which we expect to continue in light of the pending change in administrations following the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate passed legislation, which, if signed into law, would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. Thus, the full impact of the ACA on our business remains unclear.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nAdditional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which will be fully implemented in 2019. At this time it is unclear how the introduction of the Medicare quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement. Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.\nWe are currently unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the health care industry may be enacted in the future or what effect recently enacted Federal legislation or any such additional legislation or regulation would have on our business. The pendency or approval of such proposals or reforms could result in a decrease in our stock price or limit our ability to raise capital or to enter into collaboration agreements for the further development and commercialization of our programs and products.\nWe face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for our products, if any, may be reduced.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of our product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.\nCompetition may also arise from, among other things:\n\u2022\nother drug development technologies;\n\u2022\nmethods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease, including vaccines; and\n\u2022\nnew small molecule or other classes of therapeutic agents.\nDevelopments by others may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nWe are performing research on or developing products for the treatment of several disorders including endometriosis, tardive dyskinesia, uterine fibroids, Tourette syndrome, essential tremor, classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pain, and other neurological and endocrine-related diseases and disorders, and there are a number of competitors to products in our research pipeline. If one or more of our competitors\u2019 products or programs are successful, the market for our products may be reduced or eliminated.\nCompared to us, many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater:\n\u2022\ncapital resources;\n\u2022\nresearch and development resources, including personnel and technology;\n\u2022\nregulatory experience;\n\u2022\npreclinical study and clinical testing experience;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing, marketing and distribution experience; and\n\u2022\nproduction facilities.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products based on our discoveries, which may reduce demand for our products.\nOur success will depend on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nobtain patent protection for our products;\n\u2022\npreserve our trade secrets;\n\u2022\nprevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights; and\n\u2022\noperate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, both in the United States and internationally.\nBecause of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development and regulatory approval processes in order to reach the marketplace, the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Accordingly, we intend to seek patent protection for our proprietary technology and compounds. However, we face the risk that we may not obtain any of these patents and that the breadth of claims we obtain, if any, may not provide adequate protection of our proprietary technology or compounds.\nWe also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our commercial collaborators, employees and consultants. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and some, but not all, of our commercial collaborators and consultants. However, if our employees, commercial collaborators or consultants breach these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently discovered by our competitors.\nIn addition, although we own a number of patents, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability, and third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents. We cannot assure you how much protection, if any, will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court or in other proceedings. It is possible that a competitor may successfully challenge our patents or that challenges will result in limitations of their coverage. Moreover, competitors may infringe our patents or successfully avoid them through design innovation. To prevent infringement or unauthorized use, we may need to file infringement claims, which are expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology. Interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our licensors. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. We cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States.\nThe technologies we use in our research as well as the drug targets we select may infringe the patents or violate the proprietary rights of third parties.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against us or our collaborators with respect to technologies used in potential products. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or our collaborators could be forced to stop or delay developing, manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property unless that party grants us or our collaborators rights to use its intellectual property. In such cases, we could be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if our collaborators or we were able to obtain rights to the third party\u2019s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees and independent contractors, such as principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners and vendors, or by employees of our commercial partners could include failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, to report financial information or data accurately, to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or the trade secrets of our commercial partners, or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. Employee and independent contractor misconduct could also involve the improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation.\nAny relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers (actual and potential) and third-party payors in connection with our current and future business activities are and will continue to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nOur business operations and activities may be directly, or indirectly, subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including without limitation, fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including, but not limited to, research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. These laws may impact, among other things, our current activities with principal investigators and research subjects, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing and education programs.\nSuch laws include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal civil and criminal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If our operations or activities are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nIn addition, any sales of our product candidates once commercialized outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nWe face potential product liability exposure far in excess of our limited insurance coverage.\nThe use of any of our potential products in clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products, may expose us to liability claims. These claims might be made directly by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials in the amount of $10 million per occurrence and $10 million in the aggregate. However, our insurance may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may\nsuffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On occasion, juries have awarded large judgments in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would decrease our cash reserves and could cause our stock price to fall.\nOur activities involve hazardous materials, and we may be liable for any resulting contamination or injuries.\nOur research activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. If an accident occurs, a court may hold us liable for any resulting damages, which may harm our results of operations and cause us to use a substantial portion of our cash reserves, which would force us to seek additional financing.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store confidential and sensitive information on our networks and in our data centers. This information includes, among other things, our intellectual property and proprietary information, the confidential information of our collaborators and licensees, and the personally identifiable information of our employees. It is important to our operations and business strategy that this information remains secure and is perceived to be secure. Despite security measures, however, our information technology and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and data centers and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, delays and impediments to our discovery and development efforts, and damage to our reputation.", "PERMNO": 83534, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "NBIX"}
