RISK FACTORS\nSemiconductor Industry and Macroeconomic Risks\nOur operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted by volatile worldwide economic conditions and unpredictable spending by our customers due to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment.\nThough the semiconductor industry\u2019s cycle can be independent of the general economy, global economic conditions may have a direct impact on demand for semiconductor units and ultimately demand for semiconductor capital equipment and tools. Accordingly, our business and financial performance is impacted, both positively and negatively, by fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment. Expenditures by our customers depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products that use semiconductors, LEDs and batteries, including mobile devices, personal computers, consumer electronics, telecommunications equipment, automotive components, electric vehicles and other industrial products. Reductions or other fluctuations in our customers' spending as a result of uncertain conditions and volatility in the macroeconomic environment, including from government, economic or fiscal instability, economic recession, actual or potential inflation, rising interest rates, slower growth in certain geographic regions, global health crises and pandemics, restricted global credit conditions, reduced demand, excess inventory, higher energy prices, or other conditions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Further, our profitability can be affected by volatility because we incur a certain amount of fixed costs that we cannot modulate up and down to meet increases or decreases in demand. The impact of broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment could make our customers cautious and delay orders until the economic outlook becomes clearer. Significant downturns in the market for semiconductor devices or in general economic conditions reduce demand for our products and can materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our visibility into future demand is generally limited and forecasting is difficult, and we believe historic, industry-wide volatility will persist.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business, and may in the future materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting containment measures have significantly impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, and affected unemployment levels. The global responses to the COVID-19 pandemic remain dynamic. Some countries continue to impose quarantines, containment measures or travel restrictions, and certain countries, such as China, continue to impose periodic lockdowns in response to rising case numbers. In certain jurisdictions, there has been a resurgence of illnesses or threat of emerging new variants of the virus, potentially leading to more severe restrictions in the future.\nWhile we continue our normal operations in all of our manufacturing locations, work-from-home practices have been instituted or permitted from time-to-time across our offices worldwide, which have in some cases impacted our non-manufacturing productivity. We could experience further productivity disruptions in the event of an outage to systems and technologies critical to effect remote work, or from the increased data security and technology risks arising therefrom.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt our supply chain, including materials, equipment, engineering support and services, especially to, from and within China. In addition, the costs of logistics have increased as a result of general inflationary pressures, and labor shortages have further contributed to rising costs across the supply chain, further exacerbating the impact the pandemic has had on the supply chain.\nOther effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, but may include the following:\n\u2022a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand for our products resulting from widespread business shutdowns and slowdowns, quarantines, travel and logistics restrictions and other actions taken by governments, businesses, and the general public in an effort to limit exposure to and spread of COVID-19;\n\u2022negative impacts to our operations, technology development, new product introduction and customer qualifications resulting from our efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 through execution of our BCP;\n\u2022increased volatility in the semiconductor and electric vehicle industries due to heightened uncertainty, including our inability to keep pace relative to our competitors during a post-COVID-19 market recovery should that occur; and\n\u2022reduced sales volume to or loss of customers, or cancellation, delay or reduction of backlogged customer orders.\nThe ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022the extent and duration of the pandemic, the severity of the disease;\n\u2022the emergence of new variants of the virus;\n\u2022the distribution and effectiveness of available vaccines and boosters and the rates at which they are administered;\n\u2022the effects on the economy of the pandemic and of the measures taken by governmental authorities and other third parties restricting day-to-day life,\n\u2022international travel and border crossings, and the length of time that such measures remain in place; and\n\u2022governmental programs implemented to assist businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial conditions, it may also exacerbate the other risks discussed in this section on \u201cRisk Factors\u201d.\nWe depend on our suppliers, including sole source suppliers, for raw materials, components and subassemblies. If our suppliers do not deliver their products to us, or deliver non-compliant or defective products, we would be unable to deliver our products to our customers.\nOur products are complex and require raw materials, components and subassemblies having a high degree of reliability, accuracy and performance. We rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of these components and subassemblies and we rely on sole source suppliers for certain key technology parts and raw materials. As a result, we are exposed to a number of significant risks, including:\n\u2022decreased control over the manufacturing process for components and subassemblies;\n\u2022changes in our manufacturing processes in response to changes in the market, which may delay our shipments;\n\u2022our inadvertent use of defective or contaminated raw materials;\n\u2022the relatively small operations and limited manufacturing resources of some of our suppliers, which may limit their ability to manufacture and sell subassemblies, components or parts in the volumes we require and at acceptable quality levels and prices;\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to rely on suppliers due to changes in trade regulation as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns related to climate change, conflict minerals, or responsible sourcing practices;\n\u2022the inability of suppliers to meet our or other customer demand requirements;\n\u2022reliability or quality issues with certain key subassemblies provided by single source suppliers as to which we may not have any short-term alternative;\n\u2022shortages caused by disruptions at our suppliers and subcontractors for a variety of reasons, including public health emergencies and associated containment measures (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), geopolitical tensions (such as the Ukraine/Russia conflict), significant natural disasters (including as a result of climate change) or significant price changes (including as a result of inflationary pressures);\n\u2022delays in the delivery of raw materials or subassemblies, which, in turn, may delay shipments to our customers;\n\u2022loss of suppliers as a result of consolidation of suppliers in the industry; and\n\u2022loss of suppliers because of their bankruptcy or insolvency.\nIf any of these risks were to materialize, we might be unable to deliver our products to our customers on time and at expected cost, or at all. While we observed some easing of the industry-wide supply constraints towards the end of fiscal 2022, we expect constraints to continue and the duration of such constraints or their long-term impact on our business cannot be predicted at this time.\nAs part of our supply chain management, we have increased our inventory levels in an effort to mitigate component shortages. These increases in our inventory levels may lead to an excess of materials in the future in the event that the demand for our products is lower than our expectations or if we otherwise fail to anticipate future customer demand properly. Excess inventory levels could result in inventory write-downs at discounted prices, which could adversely affect our cash flows or gross margins. As a result, our business, financial condition and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe semiconductor industry is volatile with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns. Cyclical industry downturns are made worse by volatile global economic conditions.\nThe semiconductor industry is volatile, with periods of rapid growth followed by industry-wide retrenchment. These periodic downturns and slowdowns have in the past adversely affected our business, financial condition and operating results. Downturns have been characterized by, among other things, diminished product demand, excess production capacity, and accelerated erosion of selling prices. Historically these downturns have severely and negatively affected the industry\u2019s demand for capital equipment, including assembly equipment and, to a lesser extent, tools. In any case, we believe the historical volatility of our business, both upward and downward, will persist. Consequently, our revenues may decline, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nDifficulties in forecasting demand for our product lines may lead to periodic inventory shortages or excesses.\nWe typically operate our business with limited visibility of future demand. We do not have long-term contracts with many of our customers. As a result, demand for our products in future periods is difficult to predict and we sometimes experience inventory shortages or excesses. We generally order supplies and otherwise plan our production based on internal forecasts for demand. We have in the past failed, and may again in the future fail, to accurately forecast demand for our products. This has led to, and may in the future lead to, delays in product shipments or, alternatively, an increased risk of inventory obsolescence. As part of our supply chain management, we have increased our inventory levels in an effort to mitigate component shortages, which may increase the risk of inventory obsolescence. If we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and may continue to do so in the future.\nIn the past, our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly. We expect that our quarterly results will continue to fluctuate. Although these fluctuations are partly due to the cyclical and volatile nature of the semiconductor industry, they also reflect other factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nSome of the factors that may cause our net revenue and operating margins to fluctuate significantly from period to period are:\n\u2022market downturns;\n\u2022industry inventory levels;\n\u2022the mix of products we sell because, for example:\n\u25e6certain lines of equipment or certain aftermarket tools within our business segments are more profitable than others; and\n\u25e6some sales arrangements have higher gross margins than others;\n\u2022canceled or deferred orders;\n\u2022variations in sales channel or mix of direct sales and indirect sales;\n\u2022seasonality;\n\u2022competitive pricing pressures may force us to reduce prices;\n\u2022higher than anticipated costs of development, achieving customer acceptance or production of new products;\n\u2022the availability and cost of the components for our products;\n\u2022delays in the development and manufacture of our new products and upgraded versions of our products and market acceptance of these products when introduced;\n\u2022customers\u2019 delay in purchasing our products due to anticipation that we or our competitors may introduce new or upgraded products; and\n\u2022our competitors\u2019 introduction of new products.\nMany of our expenses, such as research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses, and interest expense, do not vary directly with our net revenue. Our research and development efforts include long-term projects lasting a year or more, which require significant investments. In order to realize the benefits of these projects, we believe that we must continue to fund them even during periods when our revenue has declined. As a result, a decline in our net revenue would adversely affect our operating results as we continue to make these expenditures. In addition, if we were to incur additional expenses in a quarter in which we did not experience comparable increased net revenue, our operating results would decline. In a downturn, we may have excess inventory, which could be written off. Some of the other factors that may cause our expenses to fluctuate from period-to-period include:\n\u2022timing and extent of our research and development efforts;\n\u2022severance, restructuring, and other costs of relocating facilities;\n\u2022inventory write-offs due to obsolescence or other causes; and\n\u2022an increase in the cost of labor or materials.\nBecause our net revenue and operating results are volatile and difficult to predict, we believe consecutive period-to-period or year-over-year comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.\nCompetitive Risks\nOur average selling prices usually decline over time and may continue to do so.\nTypically, our average selling prices have declined over time due to continuous price pressure from our customers and competitive cost reductions in our industry\u2019s supply chains. We seek to offset this decline by continually reducing our cost structure by consolidating operations in lower cost areas, reducing other operating costs, by pursuing product strategies focused on product performance and customer service, and developing new products for which we are able to charge higher prices. These efforts may not enable us to fully offset price declines, and if they do not, our financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to rapidly develop, manufacture and gain market acceptance of new and enhanced products required to maintain or expand our business.\nWe believe our continued success depends on our ability to continuously develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We must introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in a timely manner in response to customers\u2019 demands for higher performance assembly equipment and leading-edge materials customized to address rapid technological advances in integrated circuits, and capital equipment designs. Our competitors may develop new products or enhancements to their products that offer improved performance and features, or lower prices which may render our products less competitive. The development and commercialization of new products require significant capital expenditures over an extended period of time, and some products we seek to develop may never become profitable. In addition, we may not be able to develop and introduce products incorporating new technologies in a timely manner that will satisfy our customers\u2019 future needs or achieve market acceptance. If we are not able to develop and sell our products that meet the demands of our customers, it would result in lower net revenues and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor equipment and packaging materials industries.\nThe semiconductor equipment and packaging materials industries are very competitive. In the semiconductor equipment industry, significant competitive factors include price, speed/throughput, production yield, process control, delivery time, innovation, quality and customer support. In the semiconductor packaging materials industry, significant competitive factors include price, delivery and quality.\nIn each of our markets, we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants. In addition, established competitors may combine to form larger, better-capitalized companies. Some of our competitors have or may have significantly greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Some of these competitors are Asian and European companies that have had, and may continue to have, an advantage over us in supplying products to local customers who appear to prefer to purchase from local suppliers. Some of these competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area, sometimes with government assistance or through the support of strategic alliances, all of which could result in lowering the barriers to entry.\nWe expect our competitors to improve their current products\u2019 performance, and to introduce new products and materials with improved price and performance characteristics. Our competitors may independently develop technology similar to or better than ours. They may also appropriate our technology and our intellectual property to compete against us and we may not have adequate legal recourse. New product and material introductions by existing competitors or by new market entrants could hurt our sales. If a semiconductor manufacturer or subcontract assembler selects a competitor\u2019s product or materials for a particular assembly operation, we may not be able to sell products or materials to that manufacturer or assembler for a significant period of time. Manufacturers and assemblers sometimes develop lasting relationships with suppliers and assembly equipment providers in our industry and often go years without requiring replacement. In addition, we may have to lower our prices in response to price cuts by our competitors, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. If we cannot compete successfully, we could lose customers and experience reduced margins and profitability.\nGeographic, Trade and Customer Risks\nSubstantially all of our sales, distribution channels and manufacturing operations are located outside of the U.S., which subjects us to risks, including risks from changes in trade regulations, currency fluctuations, political instability and conflicts.\nOver 90% of our net revenue is derived from shipments to customers located outside of the U.S., primarily in the Asia/Pacific region. In the Asia/Pacific region, our customer base remains more geographically concentrated in China as a result of economic and industry conditions. Approximately 56.9%, 55.6% and 51.6% of our net revenue for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, was derived from shipments to customers located in China.\nWe expect our future performance to depend on our ability to continue to compete in foreign markets, particularly in the Asia/Pacific region. Some of these economies have been highly volatile, resulting in significant fluctuation in local currencies, and political and economic instability. Some of these economies may also increase trade protectionism, thereby increasing barriers to entry, amplifying supply chain risks and adversely affecting the demand for our products. These conditions may continue or worsen, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe also rely on non-U.S. suppliers for materials and components used in our products, and substantially all of our manufacturing operations are located in countries other than the U.S. We manufacture our ball, wedge and APAMA bonders in Singapore, our Hybrid and Electronic Assembly solutions in the Netherlands, our dicing blades, capillaries and bonding wedges in China, and our capillary blanks in Israel and China. We also rely on independent foreign distribution channels for certain of our product lines. As a result, a major portion of our business is subject to the risks associated with international, and particularly Asia/Pacific, commerce, such as:\n\u2022stringent and frequently changing trade compliance regulations;\n\u2022less protective foreign intellectual property laws, and the enforcement of patent and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022longer payment cycles in foreign markets;\n\u2022foreign exchange restrictions and capital controls, monetary policies and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022restrictions or significant taxes on the repatriation of our assets, including cash;\n\u2022tariff and currency fluctuations;\n\u2022difficulties of staffing and managing dispersed international operations, including labor work stoppages and strikes in our factories or the factories of our suppliers;\n\u2022changes in our structure or tax incentive arrangements;\n\u2022possible disagreements with tax authorities;\n\u2022episodic events outside our control such as, for example, outbreaks of coronaviruses, influenza or other illnesses;\n\u2022natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires or floods, including as a result of climate change;\n\u2022risks of war and civil disturbances, including the Ukraine/Russia conflict, or other events that may limit or disrupt manufacturing, markets and international trade;\n\u2022act of terrorism that impact our operations, customers or supply chain or that target U.S. interests or U.S. companies;\n\u2022seizure of our foreign assets, including cash;\n\u2022the imposition of sanctions of countries in which we do business;\n\u2022changing political conditions and rising geopolitical tensions; and\n\u2022legal systems which are less developed and may be less predictable than those in the U.S.\nIn addition, there is a potential risk of conflict and instability in the relationship between Taiwan and China which could disrupt the operations of our customers and/or suppliers in both Taiwan and China, our manufacturing operations in China, and our future plans in the region.\nOur international operations also depend on favorable trade relations between the U.S. and those foreign countries in which our customers, subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations. A protectionist trade environment in either the U.S. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets.\nCatastrophic events, such as pandemics and extreme weather events as a result of climate change, can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nOur operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic), cybersecurity incidents, interruptions of service from utilities, or other catastrophic events including as a result of climate change. For example, we have at times experienced temporary disruptions in our manufacturing processes as a result of power outages. In addition, global climate change can result in natural disasters occurring more frequently, with greater intensity and with less predictability. For example, in August 2022, China\u2019s Sichuan province ordered all factories to shut down for an extended period to ease a power shortage in the region resulting from an unprecedented heat wave crossing 104-degree Fahrenheit in dozens of Chinese cities. As Sichuan is a key manufacturing location for the semiconductor and solar panel industries, such power rationing measures impacted factories and suppliers who operate there. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the semiconductor industry in particular are unclear but could be severe, and could exacerbate the other risk factors described herein. Catastrophic events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, whether on a timely basis or at all, which could adversely affect our revenue and operations. Some of the systems we maintain as part of our business recovery plans cannot guarantee us protection from such disruptions. Furthermore, even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers or suppliers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, we may be unable to fulfil our customers\u2019 orders, and may experience reduced or cancelled orders or other disruptions to our supply chain that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to export restrictions that may limit our ability to sell to certain customers, and trade wars, in particular the U.S.-China trade war, could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. and several other countries levy tariffs on certain goods and impose other trade restrictions that may impact our customers\u2019 investment in manufacturing equipment, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies. In particular, trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been escalating since 2018, with U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods. We cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in response. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, additional taxes, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThough nearly all of our manufacturing activities take place outside of the U.S., certain of our advanced packaging products are subject to the EAR because they are based on U.S. technology or contain more than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content. The EAR require licenses for, and sometimes prohibit, the export of certain products. The CCL sets forth the types of goods and services controlled by the EAR, including civilian science, technology, and engineering dual-use items. For products listed on the CCL, a license may be required as a condition to export depending on the end destination, end use or end user and any applicable license exceptions.\nIn 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d) amended the EAR to expand controls on certain foreign products based on U.S. technology and sold to Huawei and certain other companies. In October 2022, the BIS amended the EAR again to extend those foreign controls to numerous companies on BIS\u2019 so-called Entity List. The 2020 and 2022 amendments impact some of our advanced packaging products, which are based on U.S. technology and are within the scope of the expanded EAR controls on Huawei and other Entity List companies. Therefore, these products cannot be sold to Huawei and other Entity List companies, and are subject to certain end-use restrictions. To date, these amendments to the EAR have not had a material direct impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations and we do not expect that they will, although they could have indirect impacts, including increasing tensions in U.S. and Chinese trade relations, potentially leading to negative sentiments towards U.S.-based companies among Chinese consumers. Additionally, some end users may prefer to avoid the U.S. supply chain to avoid the application of these regulations.\nFuture changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policy could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to decline, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause a small number of customers account for most of our sales, our net revenue could decline if we lose a significant customer.\nThe semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated, with a relatively small number of large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems purchasing a substantial portion of our semiconductor assembly equipment and packaging materials. Sales to a relatively small number of customers have historically accounted for a significant percentage of our net revenue. There was no customer with sales representing more than 10% of net revenue in fiscal 2022. Sales to our ten largest customers comprised 49.1% and 62.0% of our net revenue for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nWe expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net revenue for the foreseeable future. Thus, our business success depends on our ability to maintain strong relationships with our customers. Any one of a number of factors could adversely affect these relationships. If, for example, during periods of escalating demand for our equipment, we were unable to add inventory and production capacity quickly enough to meet the needs of our customers, or if because of supply chain constraints we are not able to fulfil our customers' orders, they may turn to other suppliers making it more difficult for us to retain their business. We may also make commitments from time-to-time to our customers regarding minimum volumes and performance standards, and if we are unable to meet those commitments, we may incur liabilities to our customers. If we lose orders from a significant customer that we are not able to replace, if a significant customer reduces its orders substantially, or if we incur liabilities for not meeting customer commitments, these losses, reductions or liabilities may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe maintain a backlog of customer orders that is subject to cancellation, reduction or delay in delivery schedules, which may result in lower than expected revenues.\nWe manufacture products primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts. As a result, we must commit resources to the manufacture of products without binding purchase commitments from customers. The semiconductor industry is occasionally subject to double-booking and rapid changes in customer outlooks or unexpected build ups of inventory in the supply channel as a result of shifts in end market demand and macro-economic conditions. Accordingly, many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty. Even in cases where our standard terms and conditions of sale or other contractual arrangements do not permit a customer to cancel an order without penalty, we may from time to time accept cancellations to maintain customer relationships or because of industry practice, custom or other factors. The broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment may result in lower than expected demand for our products, and our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could have a material adverse effect on our levels of inventory, revenues and profitability.\nHuman Capital Risks\nIncreased labor costs and competition for qualified personnel may reduce the efficiency of our flexible manufacturing model and adversely impact our operating results.\nThe labor costs in the various countries in which we operate are rising. There is substantial competition in China and Singapore for qualified and capable manufacturing personnel, which may make it difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified employees. In addition, current or future immigration laws, policies or regulations may limit our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified employees in Singapore. If we are unable to staff sufficient personnel at our China, Singapore, Israel and the Netherlands facilities or if there are increases in labor costs that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers, we may experience increased manufacturing costs, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business depends on attracting and retaining management, sales and technical employees as well as on the succession of senior management.\nOur future success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified management, sales, finance, accounting and technical employees, including senior management. Experienced personnel with the relevant and necessary skill sets in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Asia, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain the managerial, marketing, finance, accounting and technical personnel we require, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nEffective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution. From time to time, senior management or other key employees may leave our company, and the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and the results of our operations. Changes in immigration policies may also impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. In addition, hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement critical personnel could be time consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future revenues.\nProduct Risks\nAlternative packaging technologies may render some of our products obsolete and materially and adversely affect our overall business and financial results.\nAlternative packaging technologies have emerged that may improve device performance or reduce the size of an integrated circuit package, as compared to traditional wire bonding. These technologies include flip chip and wafer-level packaging. Some of these alternative technologies eliminate the need for wires to establish the electrical connection between a die and its package. The semiconductor industry may, in the future, shift a significant part of its volume into alternative packaging technologies which do not employ our products. If a significant shift to alternative packaging technologies or to another technology not offered by us were to occur, demand for our equipment and related packaging materials may be materially and adversely affected. Given that a majority of our revenue comes from wire bonding, a reduced demand for our wire bonding equipment could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may send products and equipment to customers or potential customers for trial, evaluation or other purposes which may result in retrofit charges, impairments or write-down of inventory value if the products and equipment are not subsequently purchased by the customers.\nFrom time to time we send certain products and equipment to customers or potential customers for testing, evaluation or other purposes in advance of receiving any confirmation of purchase or purchase orders. Such equipment may be at the customer location for an extended period of time per the agreements with these customers and potential customers. The customer or potential customer may refuse to buy all or partial quantities of such product or equipment and return this back to us. As a result, we may incur charges to retrofit the machines or sell the machines as second hand at a lower price, and accordingly may have to record impairments on the returned inventory, all of which would adversely affect our operating results.\nUndetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results.\nIf errata (deviations from product specifications) or flaws in design, production, assembly or testing of our products (by us or our suppliers) were to occur, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in materially adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022incurring warranty expenses;\n\u2022writing off the value of inventory;\n\u2022disposing of products that cannot be fixed;\n\u2022retrofitting products that have been shipped;\n\u2022providing product replacements or modifications; and\n\u2022defending against litigation.\nContinued improvement in manufacturing capabilities, control of material and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing are critical factors in our future growth. Our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate tests and manufacturing processes for our products may not be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment, significant repair or replacement costs, potential damage to our reputation or general customer dissatisfaction with our products. We may also not be able to obtain product liability or other insurance to fully cover such risks. Any of the foregoing risks, if they were to materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOperations and Supply Chain Risks\nWe may not be able to continue to consolidate manufacturing and other facilities or entities without incurring unanticipated costs and disruptions to our business.\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to drive further efficiency, we may consolidate our manufacturing and other facilities or entities. Should we consolidate, we may experience unanticipated events, including the actions of governments, suppliers, employees or customers, which may result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our business. We may also incur restructuring charges, severance costs, asset impairments, loss of accumulated knowledge, inefficiency during transitional periods, employee attrition and other effects that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by environmental and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations implemented in response to climate change.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use, emission, discharge, transportation and disposal of hazardous material, investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and the health and safety of our employees. Public attention continues to focus on the environmental impact of manufacturing operations and the risk to neighbors of waste and chemical releases from such operations.\nProper waste disposal plays an important role in the operation of our manufacturing plants. In many of our facilities we maintain wastewater treatment systems that remove metals and other contaminants from process wastewater. These facilities operate under permits that must be renewed periodically. A violation of those permits may lead to revocation of the permits, fines, penalties or the incurrence of capital or other costs to comply with the permits, including the potential shutdown of operations.\nCompliance with existing or future land use, environmental, climate-related and health and safety laws and regulations may: (1) result in significant costs to us for additional capital equipment or other process requirements; (2) restrict our ability to expand our operations, and/or (3) cause us to curtail our operations. We also could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines or other sanctions and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations.\nIncreasingly, various agencies and governmental bodies have expressed interest in promulgating rules relating to climate change. For example, in March 2022, the SEC published a proposed rule that would require companies to provide significantly expanded climate-related disclosures in their Form 10-K, which may require us to incur significant additional costs to comply and impose increased oversight obligations on our management and Board of Directors. The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to conduct our business.\nTo the extent that higher costs result in higher prices for our products, we may experience a reduction in the demand for those products, which could negatively affect our results of operations. Conversely, we may not be able to pass these increased costs onto our customers in the form of higher prices, as a result of which our results of operations may also be adversely affected.\nWe may acquire or divest businesses or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances, which may materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses and may decide to buy or sell businesses or enter into joint ventures or other strategic alliances. We may not find suitable acquisition candidates, we may not be able to close such acquisitions, and the acquisitions we complete may not be successful. We may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses with our existing businesses and successfully implement, improve and expand our systems, procedures and controls to accommodate these acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully integrate any acquired businesses with ours, the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully or may take longer than expected to be realized. We may also incur higher than expected costs as a result of any acquisitions or experience an overall post-completion process that takes longer than originally anticipated.\nThese transactions place additional demands on our management, our various functional teams and our current labor force. The combination of businesses may result in the loss of key personnel or an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our existing businesses and/or the acquired business. In addition, we may need to divest existing businesses, which would cause a decline in revenue or profitability and may make our financial results more volatile. If we fail to integrate and manage acquired businesses successfully or to mitigate the risks associated with divestitures, joint ventures or other alliances, or if the time and costs associated with integration exceeds our expectations, or if our acquired business were to perform poorly, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nIncreasing attention to ESG matters, including any targets or other ESG initiatives, could result in additional costs or risks or adversely impact our business\nCertain investors, shareholder advocacy groups, other market participants, customers and other stakeholder groups have focused increasingly on companies' environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) initiatives, including those concerning climate change, human rights, diversity and inclusion, and shareholder proxy access. This may result in increased costs, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations and costs, or other adverse impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters. Our sustainability report, currently in its sixth edition, continues to outline our Company\u2019s strategies, initiatives and performance of ESG topics identified through a materiality assessment to be most relevant to the operations and stakeholders of our Company. The identification, assessment, and disclosure of such matters is complex. Many of the statements in such voluntary disclosures are based on our expectations and assumptions, which may require substantial discretion and forecasts about costs and future circumstances.\nAdditionally, ESG matters continue to evolve rapidly. Organizations that provide information to investors on ESG matters may develop more discrete rating matrices, benchmarks and processes on evaluating companies on their ESG approach. This may create opportunities for misalignment or perceived failure resulting in unfavorable ESG ratings. This could foster negative investor sentiment toward us, our customers, or our industry, which could negatively impact our business and operations. To the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, it may also impede our ability to compete as effectively to recruit or retain employees, which may adversely affect our operations.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nOur success depends in part on our intellectual property, which we may be unable to protect.\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology. To protect this technology, we rely principally on contractual restrictions (such as nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions) in our agreements with employees, subcontractors, vendors, consultants and customers and on the common law of trade secrets and proprietary \u201cknow-how\u201d. We also rely, in some cases, on patent and copyright protection, although this protection may in some cases be insufficient due to the rapid development of technology in our industry. We may not be successful in protecting our technology for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022employees, subcontractors, vendors, consultants and customers may violate their contractual agreements, and the cost of enforcing those agreements may be prohibitive, or those agreements may be unenforceable or more limited than we anticipate;\n\u2022foreign intellectual property laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022our patent and copyright claims may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our technology; our patents or copyrights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented; or we may otherwise be unable to obtain adequate protection for our technology.\nAlso, competitors may copy or misappropriate our trade secrets, products or designs either through lawful means of reverse engineering or through unlawful means that we are unable to prove, in either case eroding our market share. In addition, our partners and alliances may have rights to technology developed by us. We may incur significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may be weakened.\nThird parties may claim we are infringing on their intellectual property, which could cause us to incur significant litigation costs or other expenses, or prevent us from selling some of our products.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, with frequent introductions of new products and technologies. Industry participants often develop products and features similar to those introduced by others, creating a risk that their products and processes may give rise to claims they infringe on the intellectual property of others. We may unknowingly infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and incur significant liability for that infringement. If we are found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, we could be enjoined from continuing to manufacture, market or use the affected product, or be required to obtain a license to continue manufacturing or using the affected product. A license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing or re-engineering our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly, impractical or time consuming.\nOccasionally, third parties assert that we are, or may be, infringing on or misappropriating their intellectual property rights. In these cases, we defend, and will continue to defend, against claims or negotiate licenses where we consider these actions appropriate. Intellectual property cases are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. If we become involved in this type of litigation, it could consume significant resources and divert our attention from our business.\nInformation Technology and Enterprise System Risks\nWe may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business. We also hold large amounts of data in data center facilities around the world, primarily in Singapore and the U.S., on which our business depends. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business. Our security procedures, such as virus protection software, data loss protection and our business continuity planning, such as our disaster recovery policies and back-up systems, may not be adequate or implemented properly to fully address the adverse effect of such events, which could adversely impact our operations. In addition, our business could be adversely affected to the extent we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems as our technology systems become out-of-date or obsolete and are not able to deliver the type of data integrity and reporting we need to run our business. Furthermore, when we implement new systems and/or upgrade existing systems, we could be faced with temporary or prolonged disruptions that could adversely affect our business.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. We devote significant resources to network security and other measures to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on the nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (of the Company or that belonging to third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.\nWe are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system. Our failure to implement it successfully, on time and on budget could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn 2020 we began implementing a new enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system, and will continue to implement the new system in phases across our various entities over the next two years. ERP implementations are complex, time-consuming, labor intensive, and involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities. The ERP system is critical to our ability to provide important information to our management, obtain and deliver products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, accurately maintain books and records, provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results, and otherwise operate our business. ERP implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system. Any such implementation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system, including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations. The implementation and maintenance of the new ERP system has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant financial and human resources and the implementation may be subject to delays and cost overruns. In addition, we may not be able to successfully complete the implementation of the new ERP system without experiencing difficulties.\nAny disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation or the ongoing maintenance of the new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, accurately maintain books and records, provide accurate, timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results, including reports required by the SEC such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and otherwise operate our business. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be delayed.\nCurrency and Tax Risks\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\nBecause most of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollar, an increase in value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies will make our products more expensive than those offered by some of our foreign competitors. In addition, a weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies could make our costs in non-U.S. locations more expensive to fund. Our ability to compete overseas may therefore be materially and adversely affected by the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.\nBecause nearly all of our business is conducted outside the U.S., we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Historically, our primary exposures have related to net working capital exposures denominated in currencies other than the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 functional currency, and remeasurement of our foreign subsidiaries\u2019 net monetary assets from the subsidiaries\u2019 local currency into the subsidiaries\u2019 functional currency. In general, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar could require certain of our foreign subsidiaries to record translation and remeasurement gains. Conversely, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar could require certain of our foreign subsidiaries to record losses on translation and remeasurement. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in U.S. dollars, and a weakened U.S. dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials, both of which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows. Our primary exposures include the Singapore Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, Philippine Peso, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollar, South Korean Won, Israeli Shekel, Malaysian Ringgit and Euro. Although we from time to time have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposure of our operating expenses, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful and may result in a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.\nChanges to our existing tax incentive in Singapore may materially reduce our reported results of operations in future periods.\nOur existing tax incentive, scheduled to expire in our fiscal 2025, allows certain classes of income to be subject to reduced income tax rates in Singapore provided we meet certain employment and investment conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with these conditions, we could be required to refund material tax benefits previously realized with respect to this tax incentive. Subsequent renewals are at the discretion of the Singapore government and we may not be able to extend the tax incentive arrangement beyond its expiration date or we may also elect not to renew this tax incentive arrangement. In the absence of the tax incentive, the income tax rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply is 17%, which would result in a significant increase in our provision for (benefit from) income taxes in future periods.\nChanges in tax legislation could adversely impact our future profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws and regulations are continuously evolving with corporate tax reform, base-erosion efforts, global minimum tax, and increased transparency continuing to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Although the timing and methods of implementation may vary, many countries, including those in the Asia/Pacific region in which we have significant operations, have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, legislation or practices inspired by the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d). Unless repealed or otherwise modified, beginning in our fiscal 2023, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTCJA\u201d) enactment of IRC Section 174 will require the capitalization and amortization of R&D expenditures which will increase our effective tax rate and reduce our operating cash flows. Further, the increased scrutiny on international tax and continuous changes to countries\u2019 tax legislation may also affect the policies and decisions of tax authorities with respect to certain income tax and transfer pricing positions taken by the Company in prior or future periods. We continue to monitor new tax legislation or other developments since significant changes in tax legislation, or in the interpretation of existing legislation, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOther changes in taxation could materially impact our future effective tax rate.\nAdditionally, our future effective tax rate could be affected by numerous other factors including higher or lower than anticipated foreign earnings in various jurisdictions where we are subjected to tax rates that differ from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, by changes in the valuation allowances recorded against certain deferred tax balances, or by changes in accounting principles and reporting requirements, or interpretations and application thereof. Changes in our assertion for foreign earnings permanently or non-permanently reinvested as a result of changes in facts and circumstances and challenges by tax authorities to our historic or future tax positions and transfer pricing policies could also significantly adversely impact our future effective tax rate.\nRisks Related to Our Shares and Corporate Law\nWe have the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common shares.\nWe may from time to time issue additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, which would result in dilution of our existing shareholders\u2019 equity interests in us. Our board of directors has the authority to issue, without vote or action of shareholders, preferred shares in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred shares could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common shares. In addition, we are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, up to an aggregate of 200 million common shares, of which approximately 57.1 million shares were outstanding as of October 1, 2022. We are also authorized to issue, without shareholder approval (except as required by the rules of the Nasdaq stock market), securities convertible into either common shares or preferred shares. We may issue such shares in connection with financing transactions, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions or other purposes. In addition, our shareholders will experience additional dilution when performance or restricted share units vest and settle, when we issue equity awards to our employees under our equity incentive plans, or when we otherwise issue additional equity.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and under Pennsylvania law may discourage other companies from attempting to acquire us.\nSome provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws as well as Pennsylvania law may discourage some transactions where we would otherwise experience a fundamental change. For example, our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that:\n\u2022classify our board of directors into four classes, with one class being elected each year;\n\u2022permit our board to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares without shareholder approval; and\n\u2022prohibit us from engaging in some types of business combinations with a holder of 20% or more of our voting securities without super-majority board or shareholder approval.\nFurther, under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, because our shareholders approved bylaw provisions that provide for a classified board of directors, shareholders may remove directors only for cause. These provisions and some other provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law could delay, defer or prevent us from experiencing a fundamental change and may adversely affect our common shareholders' voting and other rights.", "PERMNO": 48144, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "KLIC"}
