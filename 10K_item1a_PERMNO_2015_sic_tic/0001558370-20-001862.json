{"cik": "1192448", "company": "GLAUKOS Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nThe risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but do represent those risks that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business. Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements under the heading \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and our business requires substantial capital and operating expenditures to operate and grow. There can be no guarantee that we reach sustained profitability.\nSince the Company\u2019s inception in July 1998, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $189.7 million, principally from costs incurred in our clinical trial, research and development programs and from our general and administrative expenses. We have funded our operations to date from the sale of equity securities, including our June 2015 initial public offering (IPO), the issuance of notes payable, cash exercises of stock options and warrants to purchase equity securities and cash generated from commercial operations. To implement our global business strategies we need to, among other things, fund ongoing research and development activities, expand our manufacturing capabilities, grow our sales and marketing organization, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, acquire companies or in-license products or intellectual property, and obtain regulatory clearance or approval to commercialize our existing products in international markets or to commercialize those currently under development in the U.S. and internationally. As a result, we expect our expenses to continue to increase as we pursue these objectives. While we believe we have sufficient cash to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the date our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 are made publicly available, our ability to fund our operations are uncertain and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, any financing that we are able to obtain may negatively impact current stockholders or our ability to operate the business. Our ability to reach sustained profitability is highly uncertain, especially given our limited commercial history selling our products globally and an increasingly competitive landscape, which makes forecasting our sales more difficult.\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to generate sales of our commercialized products and develop and commercialize additional products, which we may not be able to accomplish.\nOur primary sales-generating commercial products have been the iStent, which we began selling in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2012, the iStent inject, which we began selling in the U.S. in the second half of 2018, and our Photrexa therapies, which we acquired in connection our acquisition of Avedro, Inc. (Avedro) in November 2019. We expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net sales from the iStent, the iStent inject and the Photrexa therapies.\nAs a result, it is important that we continue to build a more complete product offering. Developing additional products is expensive and time-consuming. Even if we are successful in developing our additional pipeline products, including those currently in development, the success of our new product offerings is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that our products will produce net sales in excess of the costs of development. Any current or new products could also quickly be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying superior technologies or features. Additionally, our research programs, which are expensive and time-intensive, may initially show promise in identifying potential products, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development. If we are unable to successfully commercialize additional products, our business prospects would be materially affected.\nIf we are not able to obtain market acceptance of our products globally or effectively grow our global sales and marketing organization, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our global commercialization efforts, our products may not obtain wide-spread market acceptance outside of the United States, which would adversely impact the overall utilization of our products. International markets differ significantly from the U.S. market, including as a result of differences in payor systems, reimbursement, competitive dynamics, market size, regulations and patient treatment regimens. Additionally, our future success will depend largely on our ability to train, retain and motivate skilled regional sales managers and direct sales representatives and distributors around the world with significant technical knowledge of our products. Because of the competition for their services, we may not be able to retain such representatives on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to grow our global sales and marketing organization, we may not be able to effectively commercialize our products globally, which would adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the supply and/or manufacture of our principal revenue-producing products, the iStent, the iStent inject and our Photrexa therapies, is materially disrupted, it may adversely affect our ability to manufacture products and could reduce our gross margins and negatively affect our operating results. Disruptions to our other commercialized products could also materially impact our business.\nOur corporate headquarters and the manufacturing operations for our iStent products are currently located in an approximately 98,000 square foot campus located in San Clemente, California. This location serves as our sole manufacturing location where we manufacture, inspect, package, release and ship nearly all of our iStent and iStent inject products. This is also the location where we currently conduct substantially all of our research and development (R&D) activities, customer and technical support, and management and administrative functions. We intend to relocate our corporate administrative headquarters, along with certain laboratory, R&D and warehouse space, to a new facility located in Aliso Viejo, California. If our San Clemente facility or our future facility in Aliso Viejo suffers a crippling event, or a force majeure event such as an earthquake, fire or flood, this could materially impact our ability to operate.\nAdditionally, we rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers, in some cases sole suppliers, to supply components for the iStent, the iStent inject and our other pipeline products. If any one or more of our suppliers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of components or drugs in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, we would have to seek alternative sources of supply. Because of factors such as the proprietary nature of our products, our quality control standards and regulatory requirements, we may have difficulty quickly engaging additional or replacement suppliers for some of our critical components. Despite our efforts to maintain an adequate supply of inventory, the loss of these suppliers, or their inability to provide us with an adequate supply of components or products, could cause delay in the manufacture of our products, thereby impairing our ability to meet the demand of our customers and causing significant harm to our business. Even if we are able to identify and qualify a suitable second source to replace one of our key suppliers, if necessary, that replacement supplier would not have access to our previous supplier\u2019s proprietary processes and would therefore be required to develop its own, which could result in further delay. Any disruption of this nature or increased expense could harm our commercialization efforts and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur corneal health Photrexa therapies are produced by a small number of contract manufacturing organizations. The systems that bio-activate our Photrexa therapies are primarily manufactured in Burlington, Massachusetts. Any material disruption to the manufacture of our corneal health products, either our pharmaceuticals or their bio-activation systems, could also adversely affect our operating results.\nWe and some of our component manufacturers and contract facilities are required to comply with regulatory requirements known as the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (QSR), which covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, inspection, complaint handling, recordkeeping, management review, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our device products. The FDA\u2019s Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) regulations also apply to the manufacture of our products. The FDA audits compliance with these regulatory requirements through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. If our manufacturing facilities or those of any of our component suppliers or contract facilities are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, the FDA could take enforcement action. Additionally, in the event we must obtain a replacement manufacturer, it may be difficult for us to identify and qualify a manufacturer that complies with QSR and cGMPs, which would adversely impact our operations.\nIf the quality or delivery of our products does not meet our customers\u2019 expectations, our reputation could suffer and ultimately our sales and operating earnings could be negatively impacted.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we have had to and must continue to adequately address quality issues associated with our products, including in our engineering, design, manufacturing and delivery processes, as well as issues in third-party components included in our products. Because our products are highly complex, the occurrence of performance issues may increase as we continue to introduce new products and as we rapidly scale up manufacturing to meet increased demand for our products. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. In addition, identifying the root cause of performance or quality issues, particularly those affecting third-party components, may be difficult, which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with, for example, shipment holds, product recalls and warranty or other service obligations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEpidemic diseases, such as the coronavirus, could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nAn epidemic of the coronavirus (COVID-19) is ongoing in China and other parts of the world. We cannot at this time accurately predict what effects these conditions will have on our operations and sales, including due to uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and the length of the travel restrictions and business closures imposed by governments of impacted countries. The contamination of the epidemic in China and the spread of this and other contagious diseases into areas such as Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, Europe and the United States and other key markets could affect demand for our products and impact our operating results materially.\nFailure to secure adequate coverage or reimbursement by government or other third-party payors for procedures using our products, or changes in current coverage or reimbursement, could materially impact our net sales and future growth.\nAmbulatory surgery centers, hospitals and physician private practices that purchase our products typically bill various third-party payors, such as government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs, to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the therapeutics or procedures in which our products are used and bill patients for any applicable deductibles or co-payments. Access to adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors for the procedures using our products is essential to the acceptance of our products by our customers, who may not adopt products for which there is limited or no third-party reimbursement. The requirements and processes for obtaining approval for such reimbursement may vary significantly from country to country, entail prolonged delay, or be more difficult for foreign manufacturers with new, unfamiliar products and treatments. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products or any of our product candidates may not be available or adequate in either the U.S. or international markets.\nPhysicians are typically paid separately from the facility for surgical procedures involving our products; however, there is no published Medicare payment schedule at the national level for physician payment amounts. The physician payment rate is left to the discretion of the regional Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), with each\nMAC separately determining coverage and no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained from, or maintained by, the MACs. In order to adopt a new procedure, one of the factors that the surgeon evaluates is whether or not payment for the procedure adequately covers the surgeon\u2019s time. As with the facility payment, the incremental payment the physician receives could play a role in a surgeon\u2019s decision to adopt our products. Accordingly, changes in the payment the physician receives could affect the extent to which physicians recommend procedures using our products to patients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement exists among third-party payors; coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. In addition, payors continually review new products for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny coverage. As a result, the coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly; requiring us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained, or maintained if obtained. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Any decline in the amount payors are willing to reimburse our customers for procedures using our products, including the amount payors are willing to pay the physicians performing the procedures, which is separately evaluated, could make it difficult for existing customers to continue using, or new customers to adopt, any of our products and could create additional pricing pressure for us. If we were forced to lower the price we charge for our products, our gross margins would decrease, which would adversely affect our ability to invest and grow our business. Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the U.S. and in international markets.\nOne key aspect of reimbursement in the U.S. is the use of coding. Coding refers to distinct numeric and alphanumeric billing codes that are used by healthcare providers to report the provision of medical procedures and the use of supplies for specific patients to payors. There are different categories of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (Category I, II and III) based on the procedure or supply. Although we have received a permanent healthcare common procedure coding system J code for our Photrexa pharmaceutical therapies, we have only obtained temporary Category III CPT codes for the professional fees associated with CXL and iStent-related procedures. There is no guarantee that these billing codes or the payment amounts associated with such codes will not change in the future. Prior to expiration, there are two options: submit an application to convert a temporary code to a permanent code or submit an application for a five-year extension of the temporary code. Further, even when a permanent billing code has been assigned to a product, there is no guarantee that coverage will be provided. MACs have in the past, and may in the future, change coverage terms, which could result in inadequate reimbursement and impact the use of our products. If we are unable to maintain our existing codes or obtain new permanent codes for procedures using our products, or obtain new reimbursement codes for our other products in development, we may be subject to significant pricing pressure, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf our competitors are able to develop and market products that are safer, more effective, less costly or otherwise more attractive than our products, our commercial opportunity may be reduced or eliminated.\nOur industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and profound technological, market and product-related changes. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development of new products for the treatment of chronic eye diseases. Our competitors, medical companies, academic and research institutions or others could develop new drugs, therapies, medical devices or surgical procedures that could render our products obsolete. If such other products demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, ease of use or lower costs than our products, it may reduce demand for our products, and our business may be harmed.\nMany of our current and potential competitors are large publicly traded companies or divisions of publicly traded companies and have more resources, greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established relationships with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors, broader products lines that provide rebate and bundling opportunities, more established sales and marketing programs and distribution networks, and greater experience in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval. If we are unable to effectively compete, it could adversely affect our business.\nOphthalmic surgeons may not use our products if they do not believe they are safe, efficient, effective and preferable alternatives to other treatment solutions in the market or may use our products without being adequately trained, which could result in inferior clinical outcomes.\nWe believe that ophthalmic surgeons will not use our products unless they conclude that our products provide a safe, efficient, effective and preferable alternative to currently available treatment options. If ophthalmic surgeons determine that any of our products are not sufficiently effective, efficient or safe, whether based on longer-term patient studies or clinical experience or unsatisfactory patient outcomes or patient injury, our sales would be harmed. It is also possible that as our products become more widely used, latent defects could be identified, creating negative publicity and liability problems for us and adversely affecting demand for our products. If an increasing number of ophthalmic surgeons do not continue to adopt the use of our products, our operating and financial results will be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, inferior patient outcomes, or patient injury, may result if untrained or unqualified ophthalmic surgeons elect to perform procedures using our products. After an ophthalmic surgeon is trained by our sales representatives, the surgeon and/or surgical facility that the surgeon utilizes are cleared to purchase, and administer procedures using, our products. There is a risk that untrained or unqualified ophthalmic surgeons could gain access to our products from a facility\u2019s inventory and conduct procedures without having received qualified status from us. If performing procedures by unqualified ophthalmic surgeons were to become pervasive, this could raise the risk of complications and inferior clinical outcomes, which could result in negative patient experiences or experiences being published and damaging our reputation and that of our products. This could result in lower penetration and utilization by ophthalmic surgeons and could have a material adverse effect on our net sales growth, expected operating results and financial condition.\nProduct liability suits brought against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities, limit sales of our existing products and interfere with commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nIf our product offerings are defectively designed or manufactured, contain defective materials, or are used or deployed improperly, or if someone claims any of the foregoing, whether or not such claims are meritorious, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could divert management\u2019s attention from our business, be expensive to defend, result in sizable damage awards against us, damage our reputation, increase our product liability insurance rates, prevent us from securing continuing coverage, or prevent or interfere with commercialization of our products. In addition, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all future claims. Product liability claims brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage would likely be paid out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and results of operations.\nOperating results could be unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur net sales may experience volatility due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf our ability to drive increased sales of our products;\n\u25cf our ability to establish and maintain an effective and dedicated sales organization;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the demand for our products;\n\u25cf pricing pressure applicable to our products, including adverse third-party coverage and reimbursement outcomes and competitor pricing;\n\u25cf results of clinical research and trials on our products or competitive products;\n\u25cf timing of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf decisions by customers to defer orders in anticipation of the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf sampling by and additional training requirements for physicians upon the commercialization of a new product by us or one of our competitors;\n\u25cf our ability to manage the risks associated with introducing new products, including inventory management;\n\u25cf regulatory approvals and legislative changes affecting the products we may offer or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf interruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products;\n\u25cf the ability of our suppliers to timely provide us with an adequate supply of product components;\n\u25cf the effect of competing technological, industry and market developments;\n\u25cf changes in our ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our products;\n\u25cf variances in the sales terms, timing or volume of customer orders from period to period;\n\u25cf the length of our sales cycle, which varies and may be unpredictable; and\n\u25cf our ability to expand the geographic reach of our sales and marketing efforts.\nAs a result, you should not rely on our results in any past period as an indication of future results and you should anticipate that fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results may continue and could generate volatility in the price of our common stock. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nIf we fail to manage our anticipated growth effectively, or are unable to increase or maintain our manufacturing capacity, we may not be able to meet customer demand for our products and our business could suffer.\nSince the commercial launch of the iStent in July 2012, we have seen significant period-to-period growth in our business, both organically and through transactions, and we must continue to grow in order to meet our business and financial objectives. However, continued growth may create numerous challenges, including:\n\u25cf new and increased responsibilities for our management team;\n\u25cf increased pressure on our operating, financial and reporting systems;\n\u25cf increased competition;\n\u25cf increased pressure to anticipate and satisfy market demand;\n\u25cf additional manufacturing capacity requirements;\n\u25cf strain on our ability to source a larger supply of components that meet our required specifications on a timely basis;\n\u25cf management of an increasing number of relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties;\n\u25cf entry into new international territories with unfamiliar regulations and business approaches; and\n\u25cf the need to hire, train and manage additional qualified personnel.\nAlthough we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our current business plans, there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities, and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner. For example, manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facility or launch new products. Also, we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand as we introduce new products. As a result, we may experience difficulties in meeting customer demand, in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions, and demand for our products could decline. If we fail to manage any of the above challenges effectively, our business may be harmed.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to retain members of our senior management and other key employees. If we are unable to retain or recruit qualified personnel for growth, our business results could suffer.\nWe have benefited substantially from the leadership and performance of our senior management as well as certain key employees. For example, our chief executive officer, as well as other key members of our senior management, has experience successfully developing novel technologies and scaling early-stage medical device and pharmaceutical companies to achieve profitability. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our current management and key employees, and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management and key employees in our industry is intense and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our personnel or attract new, qualified personnel. The loss of services of certain members of our senior management or key employees could prevent or delay the implementation and completion of our strategic objectives, or divert management\u2019s attention to seeking qualified replacements. Each member of senior management as well as our key employees may terminate employment without notice and without cause or good reason. The members of our senior management are not subject to non-competition agreements. Accordingly, the adverse effect resulting from the loss of certain members of senior management could be compounded by our inability to prevent them from competing with us.\nIn addition to competing for market share for our products, we also compete against our competitors for personnel, including qualified sales representatives that are necessary to grow our business. Universities and research institutions also compete with us for scientific and clinical personnel that are important to our research and development efforts. We also rely on consultants and advisors in our research, operations, clinical and commercial efforts to implement our business strategies. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. Our strategic plan requires us to continue growing our sales, marketing, clinical and operational infrastructure in order to generate, and meet, the demand for our products. If we fail to retain or attract these key personnel, we could fail to take advantage of the market for our products, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs we expand our product offerings, some of our products are, and others will be, regulated as drugs and be subject to different regulatory requirements.\nAs we have expanded our product offerings through organic growth and acquisitions, certain of our products are, and others will be, subject to the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals. This process is often a more lengthy, costly and complex process than obtaining regulatory approval for a medical device. The future success of our pharmaceutical and hybrid device and pharmaceutical products depends on our ability to complete clinical trials, and will require significant development activities, regulatory approvals, and substantial additional investment.\nWe have and may continue to enter into acquisitions, collaborations, in-licensing agreements, joint ventures, alliances or partnerships with third parties that could fail.\nWe have and may continue to enter into acquisitions, collaborations, in-licensing agreements, joint ventures, alliances, partnerships or undertake one or more of these transactions in order to retain our competitive position within the marketplace or to expand into new markets. Examples include our acquisitions of DOSE and Avedro, as well as our licensing of Santen\u2019s Preserflo MicroShunt and the Intratus drug delivery platform. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete any future acquisition we choose to pursue, or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner. Our future successes will depend, in part, on our ability to manage an expanded business, which may pose substantial\nchallenges for our management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in managing such expanded business or that we will realize the expected economies of scale, synergies and other benefits currently anticipated from recent or future acquisitions or strategic transactions. In addition, if we are unable to integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies effectively, our business will likely suffer. Additionally, some of these collaborations, joint ventures, alliances and partnerships require us to invest a substantial amount of resources. These arrangements may be terminated before we are able to realize net sales to sufficiently cover the costs associated therewith, which could materially impact our business. We cannot assure you that any such transaction would result in the benefits expected from the transaction, including revenue growth, increased profitability or an enhancement in our business prospects. Achieving the benefits of any acquisition, including the DOSE and Avedro transactions, will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the business, operations and products of the acquired entities successfully and efficiently with our business, which we may not be able to accomplish. Further, pursuing acquisitions, collaborations, in licensing agreements, joint ventures, alliances or partnerships with third parties, whether or not completed, is costly and time-consuming and could distract Company management from the operation of the business, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions or data corruption could materially disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage sales and marketing data, accounting and financial functions, inventory management, product development tasks, clinical data, customer service and technical support functions. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power losses, computer system or data network failures, security breaches, data corruption and cyber-based attacks, including malicious software programs or other attacks, which have been attempted against us in the past. In addition, a variety of our software systems are cloud-based data management applications, hosted by third-party service providers whose security and information technology systems are subject to similar risks.\nThe failure to protect either our or our service providers\u2019 information technology infrastructure could disrupt our entire operation or result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, product shortages, loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, intellectual property or sensitive or personal information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nFailure to comply with data privacy and security laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to state, federal and foreign laws relating to data privacy and security in the conduct of our business, including state breach notification laws, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), the European Union\u2019s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). These laws affect how we collect and use data of our employees, consultants, customers and other parties. Furthermore, these laws impose substantial requirements that require the expenditure of significant funds and employee time to comply, and additional states and countries are enacting new data privacy and security laws, which will require future expansion of our compliance efforts. We also rely on third parties to host or otherwise process some of this data. In some instances, these third parties have experienced immaterial failures to protect data privacy. Any failure by a third party to prevent security breaches could have adverse consequences for us. We will need to expend additional resources and make significant investments to comply with data privacy and security laws. Our failure to comply with these laws or prevent security breaches of such data could result in significant liability under applicable laws, cause disruption to our business, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot be certain that our net operating loss tax carryforwards will be available to offset future taxable income.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had approximately $356.6 million, $144.0 million and $13.3 million of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for federal, state and foreign purposes, respectively, available to offset future taxable income.\nThe federal NOL carryforwards incurred prior to 2018 begin to expire in 2022. A federal NOL carryforward of $103.1 million will not expire, but can only be used to offset 80 percent of future taxable income. The state NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021. The foreign NOL will begin to expire in 2023. At December 31, 2019, we had federal and state research and development carryforwards of approximately $28.9 million and $12.8 million, respectively. Federal credits begin to expire in 2021, and state credits of $2.9 million begin to expire in 2023. The remaining state credits of $9.8 million carry over indefinitely. We continue to provide a full valuation allowance against these tax attributes because we believe that uncertainty exists with respect to their future realization, as well as with respect to the amount of the tax attributes that will be available in future periods. To the extent available, we intend to use these NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income associated with our operations. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period to utilize any remaining NOL carryforwards before they expire.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment\nOur business, products and processes are subject to extensive regulation and it can be costly to comply with these regulations. Any failure to adhere to applicable regulations could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur products are subject to extensive government regulation in the U.S. by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and state regulatory authorities and by foreign regulatory authorities in the countries in which we conduct business. These regulations relate to, among other things, research and development, design, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, clearance or approval, environmental controls, safety and efficacy, labeling, advertising, promotion, pricing, recordkeeping, reporting, import and export, post-approval studies and the sale and distribution of our products. See Item 1, Business, \u201cGovernment Regulation -- Regulation & Reimbursement in the U.S.\u201d for additional information.\nThe process of obtaining clearance or approvals to market a medical device, drug or other product can be expensive and lengthy, and we cannot guarantee that our current products will receive approval for additional indications or that our future products will receive clearance or approval on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical trials or testing could significantly affect our product development costs. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients in a timely manner or be completed on schedule, if at all. Conducting clinical trials is a complex and expensive process, can take many years, and outcomes are inherently uncertain. We incur substantial expense for, and devote significant time to, clinical trials but cannot be certain that the trials will ever result in commercial sales. We may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials showed promising results, and failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Any of our products may malfunction or may produce undesirable adverse effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials. We, the clinical trial investigators, the independent review board responsible for overseeing the trial, the FDA, or another regulatory authority may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time to avoid exposing trial participants to unacceptable health risks. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIn some instances, we may pursue a regulatory approval pathway that proves unsuccessful. For example, we intend to seek FDA approval of a new drug application (NDA) under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) for our drug delivery implant, iDose. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway for iDose as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval would likely substantially increase. Moreover, the inability to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the market faster than our product candidate, which could materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. We cannot assure you that we will receive the requisite or timely approvals for commercialization of our product candidates.\nEven after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations and applicable foreign laws and regulations. We and our suppliers are subject to\nextensive post-marketing regulatory requirements and failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to enforcement actions. Other post-market requirements that may regulate our products include registration and device listing, quality system requirements, reporting of adverse events and device malfunctions, reporting of corrections and removals, labeling requirements, and promotional restrictions. Our products could experience performance problems that require review and possible corrective action by us or a component supplier. Any recall, whether required by the FDA or another regulatory authority or initiated by us, could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales.\nThe FDA, state and foreign regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, state or foreign regulatory authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u25cf untitled letters or warning letters;\n\u25cf fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u25cf recalls, termination of distribution, administrative detention, or seizure of our products;\n\u25cf customer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds;\n\u25cf operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf delays in or refusal to grant our requests for future 510(k) clearances, NDA or pre-market approvals (PMA) or foreign regulatory approvals of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;\n\u25cf withdrawals or suspensions of current 510(k) clearances, NDAs or PMAs or foreign regulatory approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products;\n\u25cf FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nAlthough we do not currently provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors for our products, we are subject to healthcare fraud, abuse and transparency regulations and enforcement by federal and state governments, including with respect to our marketing, training and other practices, which could significantly impact our business. To ensure compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other regulations, government agencies or their contractors often conduct routine audits and request customer records and other documents to support claims submitted for payment of services rendered. Government agencies or their contractors also periodically open investigations and obtain information from healthcare providers.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of the laws applicable to our business and products is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, any of which could harm our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn the U.S. and in certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the regulatory and healthcare systems in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably, if at all. In the U.S. in recent years, new legislation has been proposed and adopted at the federal and state levels that is\neffecting major changes in the healthcare system. In addition, new regulations and interpretations of existing healthcare statutes and regulations are frequently adopted.\nIn March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (ACA) was signed into law. The ACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, encourages improvements in the quality of healthcare items and services and significantly impacts the medical device industry.\nIn May 2017, the EU adopted Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745 (MDR), which will repeal and replace the Medical Device Directive (MDD). MDR will take effect beginning May 26, 2020. Although MDR does not set out a substantially different regulatory system, it provides for stricter controls of medical devices. Under provisions that govern the transition period until MDR takes effect, medical devices with notified body certificates issued under the MDD prior to May 26, 2020 may continue to be marketed and sold as long as those certificates are valid, until May 27, 2024 at the latest. After the expiration of any applicable transitional period, only devices that have been CE marked under MDR may be placed on the market in the EU.\nIf, as a result of legislative or regulatory healthcare reform, we cannot sell our products profitably, our business would be harmed. In addition, any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.\nAs our growth strategy turns increasingly global, we are, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of risks associated with our international operations, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur existing foreign operations, as well as our planned international growth, expose us to additional uncertainty and risks beyond regulatory authorization and reimbursement levels. Outside the U.S., we sell our products through direct sales organizations in sixteen countries and a network of third-party distribution partners in other markets. These international operations expose us and our subsidiaries and third-party distributors to a variety of risks including, without limitation, the following:\n\u25cf different, and in some cases more exacting and lengthy, regulatory approval processes and pricing and reimbursement systems;\n\u25cf compliance with foreign regulations and laws, as well as U.S. laws that apply to activities in foreign jurisdictions, the adherence to which can be costly. Such regulations and laws expose us to penalties for non-compliance. These laws and regulations include various anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, the French Sunshine Act, as well as privacy regulations such as the GDPR and export control regulations. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities and exclusion or debarment from government contracting;\n\u25cf difficulties enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending against third-party threats and intellectual property enforcement actions against us, our distributors, or any of our third-party suppliers;\n\u25cf reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf pricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf a shortage of high-quality sales people and distributors, and the difficulties of managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf the availability and level of third-party coverage and reimbursement within prevailing foreign healthcare systems that may require some of the patients who would be good candidates for procedures using products\nto directly absorb medical costs, the ability of those patients to elect to privately pay for procedures using products, or the potential necessity to reduce the selling prices of our products;\n\u25cf relative disadvantages compared to competitors with more recognizable names, longer operating histories and better established distribution networks and customer relationships;\n\u25cf political and economic instability;\n\u25cf changes in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u25cf the imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u25cf scrutiny of foreign tax authorities that could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us;\n\u25cf laws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u25cf longer sales and payment cycles;\n\u25cf difficulties in maintaining consistency with our internal guidelines;\n\u25cf difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u25cf the imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements and restrictions, particularly relating to technology;\n\u25cf international terrorism and anti-U.S. sentiment; and\n\u25cf the imposition of U.S. or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity.\nIf we experience any of these risks, our sales in non-U.S. jurisdictions may be harmed, our results of operations would suffer, and our business prospects would be negatively impacted.\nLegislative changes may also impact our operations. The United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which voters approved withdrawal from the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit). On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the EU. The future relationship between the U.K. and the EU remains uncertain as the U.K. and the EU work through the transition period that provides time for them to negotiate the details of their future relationship. The transition period maintains all existing trading arrangements. The transition period is currently expected to end on December 31, 2020, and, if no agreement is reached, the default scenario would be a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the U.K. will leave the EU with no agreements in place beyond any temporary arrangements that have or may be put in place by the EU or individual EU member states, and the U.K. as part of no-deal contingency efforts and those conferred by mutual membership of the World Trade Organization. It is possible that as a result of Brexit there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports into and out of the U.K. and EU countries and regulatory complexities that could adversely impact the Company.\nOur operations involve hazardous materials, and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of, and human exposure to, hazardous and toxic materials. We could incur costs, fines, and civil and criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. Compliance with current or future environmental and safety laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, impair our research, development or production efforts, or require us to incur other significant expenses. There can be no assurance that violations of environmental laws or regulations will not occur in the future as a result of the inability to obtain permits, human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitors and other third parties could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, which would substantially impair our ability to compete.\nOur success and ability to compete depends significantly upon our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our proprietary rights and licensed intellectual property rights to the technologies and inventions used in or embodied by our products. We rely on a combination of patents and trademark rights, and to a lesser extent on trade secrets and copyrights, together with licenses and nondisclosure agreements to protect our technologies. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our business. We also have not pursued or maintained, and may not pursue or maintain in the future, patent protection for our products in every country or territory in which we sell or will in the future sell our products. In addition, we cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications or pending trademark applications will issue or that, if issued, they will issue in a form that will be advantageous to us.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately protect these rights, which could substantially impair our ability to compete. Our patents may be challenged and held invalid or we may be unable to extend the protection on products with expiring patents. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. Further, although it is our policy to require each of our employees, consultants and any other parties who may be involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf to execute proprietary information and inventions agreements, we may be unsuccessful in doing so with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The relevant assignment provisions may not be self-executing or may be breached, resulting in ownership disputes and/or litigation.\nWe have a number of foreign patents and patent applications, and expect to pursue patent protection in the most significant markets in which we do business. The laws of other countries in which our product offerings are or may be sold may not protect our product offerings and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. Many companies have encountered significant difficulties in obtaining, protecting and defending such rights in international markets. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against other parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, and certain countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to other parties. We also may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries. If we encounter such difficulties or we are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in these jurisdictions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed.\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate or control our future operating expenses in relation to obtaining, enforcing and/or defending intellectual property, which could lead to cash shortfalls. Our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation or costs associated with administrative proceedings and the results of such proceedings.\nWe have been and may in the future become involved in patent and other intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights, which could be costly, time consuming and unsuccessful and could interfere with our ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nIntellectual property rights are essential to our business. We have asserted and may in the future need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our rights, or to invalidate or challenge the intellectual property rights of a third party, including those rights owned by our competitors. For example, see Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a description of our legal proceedings. Additionally, third parties could assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to our current or future commercial products and seek to invalidate one or more of our patents or trademarks. Intellectual property disputes often involve complex legal and factual questions, and could result in significant costs, substantial damages and our inability to manufacture, market or sell our existing or future products that are found to infringe. Even if we were to prevail in any such action, the litigation or administrative proceeding could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources that could materially and adversely affect our business. Such claims could arise in situations where certain employees, consultants or contractors were previous, or are currently, employed by other medical device, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the intellectual property, proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, misappropriated the intellectual property or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information, of these former employers or competitors.\nThere is no guarantee that we would be successful enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights in court. A court could hold that some or all of our asserted intellectual property rights are not infringed, or could invalidate our rights, hold our rights unenforceable, or substantially narrow the scope of protection. Further, we could be prohibited from selling our products or a court could order us to pay compensatory damages as well as other penalties and fines. Any such adverse result would undermine our competitive position. Regardless of the final outcome, any litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company and Our Common Stock\nRisks generally associated with a company-wide implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe are in the process of implementing a company-wide ERP system to upgrade certain existing business, operational, and financial processes. Our ERP implementation is a complex and time-consuming project. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience time delays or cost overruns during the ERP implementation process, or if the ERP system or associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect. This project has required and may continue to require investment of capital and human resources, the re-engineering of processes of our business, and the attention of many employees who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business. Any deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new ERP system could result in higher costs than we had anticipated and could adversely affect our ability to develop and launch solutions, provide services, fulfill contractual obligations, file reports with the SEC in a timely manner, operate our business or otherwise affect our controls environment. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, because the ERP is a new system and we have no prior experience with it, there is an increased risk that one or more of our financial controls may fail. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the New York Stock Exchange, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price for our common stock may fluctuate depending upon many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u25cf volume, timing and nature of orders for our products;\n\u25cf developments generally affecting our industry;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated quarterly variation in our results of operations or the results of our competitors;\n\u25cf the announcements by us or our competitors of new products or product enhancements, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf issuance of new or changes in earnings estimates or recommendations or reports by securities analysts;\n\u25cf investor perceptions of us and our business, including changes in market valuations of medical device companies;\n\u25cf actions by institutional or other large stockholders;\n\u25cf commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u25cf failure to achieve significant sales;\n\u25cf manufacturing disruptions that could occur if we were unable to successfully expand our production in our current or an alternative facility;\n\u25cf any future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u25cf any major change to the composition of our board of directors or management;\n\u25cf our results of operations and financial performance, including any failure to achieve publicly disclosed forecasts or guidance; and\n\u25cf general economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, the market price of the stocks of medical device, medical technology, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life science companies have experienced significant volatility that often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u25cf authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 5,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u25cf require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be affected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u25cf specify that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or the president;\n\u25cf establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u25cf establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving staggered three year terms;\n\u25cf provide that our directors may be removed only for cause by a supermajority vote of our stockholders;\n\u25cf provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u25cf specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n\u25cf require a supermajority vote of the stockholders and a majority vote of the board to amend certain of the above-mentioned provisions and our bylaws.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.\nOur charter provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between the Company and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees.\nThe Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Glaukos (the Glaukos Charter) provides that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company or its stockholders, (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Glaukos Charter or our bylaws, or (iv) any action or proceeding asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The exclusive forum provision in the Glaukos Charter will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with the combined company or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and other employees. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to the Company than to our stockholders. However, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies' certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find this type of provision to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in the Glaukos Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 15454, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "GKOS"}
