{"cik": "1355848", "company": "Genius Brands International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on Page of this Form 10-K.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe have incurred net losses since inception.\nWe have a history of operating losses and incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter since our inception. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated net revenues of $866,875 and incurred a net loss of $6,213,135, while for the previous year, we generated net revenue of $907,983 and incurred a net loss of $3,483,122. These losses, among other things, have had an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, stockholders\u2019 equity, net current assets and working capital.\nWe will need to generate additional revenue to achieve profitability. We are beginning to generate revenues derived from our existing properties, properties in production, new brands being introduced into the marketplace, and incremental revenue derived from the licensing business we manage on behalf of our clients. However, the ability to sustain these revenues and generate significant additional revenues or achieve profitability will depend upon numerous factors some of which are outside of our control.\nWe will need additional financing to continue our operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, we will need to curtail or cease our development plans and operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $2,887,921 of available cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Additional funds may be required to fund operations which could be raised through the issuance of equity securities and/or debt financing. There being no assurance that any type of financing on terms acceptable to us will be available or otherwise occur. Debt financing must be repaid regardless of whether we generate revenues or cash flows from operations and may be secured by substantially all of our assets. Any equity financing or debt financing that requires the issuance of warrants or other equity securities to the lender would cause the percentage ownership by our current stockholders to be diluted, which dilution may be substantial. Also, any additional equity securities issued may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. Any equity financing at a price below the then current conversion price of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio, applicable to such securities, resulting in the issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock upon the conversion of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which would further dilute our other stockholders.\nIf we are not able to obtain sufficient capital, we may then be forced to limit the scope of our operations.\nWe expect that as our business continues to grow we will need additional working capital. If adequate additional debt and/or equity financing is not available on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to continue to expand our business, and we will have to modify our business plans accordingly. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and our financial condition.\nIf we reach a point where we are unable to raise needed additional funds to continue as a going concern, we could be forced to cease our activities and dissolve our company. In such an event, we will need to satisfy various creditors and other claimants, severance, lease termination and other dissolution-related obligations.\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period.\nCash flow and projections for any entertainment company producing original content can be expected to fluctuate until the animated content and ancillary consumer products are in the market and could fluctuate thereafter even when the content and products are in the marketplace. There is significant lead time in developing and producing animated content before that content is in the marketplace. Unanticipated delays in entertainment production can delay the release of the content into the marketplace. Structured retail windows that dictate when new products can be introduced at retail are also out of our control. While we believe that we have mitigated this in part by creating a slate of properties at various stages of development or production as well as representing certain established brands which contribute immediately to cash flow, any delays in the production and release of our content and products or any changes in the preferences of our customers could result in lower than anticipated cash flows.\nAs with our cash flows, our revenues and results of operations depend significantly upon the appeal of our content to our customers, the timing of releases of our products and the commercial success of our products, none of which can be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate from period to period. The results of one period may not be indicative of the results of any future period. Any quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. This could cause the price of our Common Stock to fluctuate.\nProduction cost will be amortized according to the individual film forecasting methodology. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue, we would be required to adjust amortization of related production costs. These adjustments would adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the United States, global or regional economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of our business.\nA decrease in economic activity in the United States or in other regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our products, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. A decline in economic conditions could reduce demand for and sales of our products. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the animated content and consumer products we offer, which could also decrease our revenues, increase our costs, or both.\nInaccurately anticipating changes and trends in popular culture, media and movies, fashion, or technology can negatively affect our sales.\nWhile trends in the toddler to tween sector change quickly, we respond to trends and developments by modifying, refreshing, extending, and expanding our product offerings on an on-going basis. However, we operate in extremely competitive industries where the ultimate appeal and popularity of content and products targeted to this sector can be difficult to predict. We believe our focus on \u201ccontent with a purpose\u201d serves an underrepresented area of the toddler to tween market; however, if the interest of our audience trends away from our current properties toward other offerings based on current media, movies, animated content or characters, and if we fail to accurately anticipate trends in popular culture, movies, media, fashion, or technology, our products may not be accepted by children, parents, or families and our revenues, profitability, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe face competition from a variety of retailers that sell similar merchandise and have better resources than we do.\nThe industries in which we operate are competitive, and our results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, competitive pricing, promotional pressures, additional competitor offerings and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Indirectly through our licensing arrangements, we compete for retailers as well as other outlets for the sale and promotion of our licensed merchandise. Our primary competition comes from competitors such as The Walt Disney Company, Nickelodeon Studios, and the Cartoon Network.\nWe have sought a competitive advantage by providing \u201ccontent with a purpose\u201d which are both entertaining and enriching for children and offer differentiated value that parents seek in making purchasing decisions for their children. While we do not believe that this value proposition is specifically offered by our competitors, our competitors have greater financial resources and more developed marketing channels than we do which could impact our ability, through our licensees, to secure shelf space thereby decreasing our revenues or affecting our profitability and results of operations.\nThe production of our animated content is accomplished through third-party production and animation studios around the world, and any failure of these third-parties could negatively impact our business.\nAs part of our business model to manage cash flows, we have partnered with a number of third-party production and animation studios around the world for the production of our new content in which these partners fund the production of the content in exchange for a portion of revenues generated in certain territories. We are reliant on our partners to produce and deliver the content on a timely basis meeting the predetermined specifications for that product. The delivery of inferior content could result in additional expenditures by us to correct any problems to ensure marketability. Further, delays in the delivery of the finished content to us could result in our failure to deliver the product to broadcasters to which it has been pre-licensed. While we believe we have mitigated this risk by aligning the economic interests of our partners with ours and managing the production process remotely on a daily basis, any failures or delays from our production partners could negatively affect our profitability.\nIf we fail to honor our obligations under the terms of our third party supplier or loan agreements, our business may be adversely affected.\nIn early 2014, we entered into an exclusive 3-year arrangement with DADC which gave DADC the right to fulfill our DVD and CD duplication requirements for our product. In consideration for these exclusive rights, we received an initial marketing support payment of $750,000 with an additional $750,000 paid in February 2015. DADC was to recoup the marketing support payment through a premium on the physical media unit costs. We were obligated to repay a pro-rata portion of the marketing support payment if we do not order a minimum number of DVD/CD units during the term and to do so may require us to divert funds from operations which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOn February 18, 2016, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with Sony pursuant to which we agreed to grant Sony certain rights for the marketing and distribution of our animated feature-length motion pictures and animated television series in the United States and Canada, and potentially additional countries. In consideration for such rights, and subject to certain conditions, Sony paid us an advance in the amount of $2.0 million, against future royalties.\nOn January 10, 2017, we entered into an amendment of our home entertainment Distribution Agreement with Sony pursuant to which, among other things, Sony agreed to pay $1,489,583 which was owed and payable by us to DADC for certain disk manufacturing and replication services, thereby terminating the agreement with DADC.\nIn connection with such transaction, we issued Sony 301,231 shares of our Common Stock at $4.945 per share, Sony\u2019s exclusive territory for exercising its home entertainment distribution rights under the distribution agreement was extended from the United States and Canada to worldwide, and the amount of advances subject to recoupment by Sony out of royalty payments that would otherwise be due to us under the Distribution Agreement was increased by the amount of the payment to DADC. Future cash flow from the distributed products under the distribution agreement, if any, will be impacted by the additional recoupment obligation. In connection with the above issuance of our shares, we entered into a subscription agreement with Sony, effective as of January 17, 2017.\nOn August 8, 2016, Llama Productions LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, closed a $5,275,000 multiple draw-down, non-recourse, secured, non-revolving credit facility (the \u201cFacility\u201d) with Bank Leumi USA to produce our animated series Llama Llama (the \u201cSeries\u201d). The Series is configured as fifteen half-hour episodes comprised of thirty 11 minute programs to be delivered to Netflix in fall 2017. The Facility is secured by the license fees we will receive from Netflix for the delivery of the Series as well as our copyright in the Series. The Facility has a term of 40 months and has an interest rate of one, three, or six month LIBOR plus 3.25%. We are obligated to repay the Facility and intend to do so from the receipt of the license fees to be received from Netflix commencing on the final delivery and acceptance of Series by Netflix. We have secured a completion bond through Film Finances Inc. to insure our obligations under the terms of the License Agreement with Netflix. A material default in the terms of the License Agreement with Netflix or a failure to deliver the Series in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement could result in a default in the terms of the Facility and liability, among other remedies, for the repayment of the Facility and/or the completion bond. As a condition of the loan agreement with Bank Leumi, we deposited $1,000,000 into a cash account to be used solely for the production of the Series. If we fail to comply with our obligations under the foregoing loan agreement, our business may be adversely affected.\nFailure to successfully market or advertise our products could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs. Our ability to sell products is dependent in part upon the success of these programs. If we or our licensees do not successfully market our products or if media or other advertising or promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe failure of others to promote our products may adversely affect our business.\nThe availability of retailer programs relating to product placement, co-op advertising and market development funds, and our ability and willingness to pay for such programs, are important with respect to promoting our properties. In addition, although we may have agreements for the advertising and promotion of our products through our licensees, we will not be in direct control of those marketing efforts and those efforts may not be done in a manner that will maximize sales of our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological advances.\nThe entertainment industry in general, and the music and motion picture industries in particular, continue to undergo significant changes, primarily due to technological developments. Because of the rapid growth of technology, shifting consumer tastes and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment, it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on potential revenue from, and profitability of, distributing entertainment programming. As it is also impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on our ability to compete effectively in a changing market, if we are not able to keep pace with these technological advances, our revenues, profitability and results from operations may be materially adversely affected.\nFailure in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt the operation of our business.\nOur ability to execute our business plan and maintain operations depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. IT systems are vulnerable to risks and damages from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our and our vendors\u2019 servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, including cyber-attacks, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. These events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If our computer systems are compromised, we could be subject to fines, damages, litigation and enforcement actions, and we could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm our business. Despite precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nLoss of key personnel may adversely affect our business.\nOur success greatly depends on the performance of our executive management team, including Andy Heyward, our Chief Executive Officer and Stone Newman, our President of Global Consumer Products, Worldwide Content Sales & Marketing. The loss of the services of any member of our core executive management team or other key persons could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur management team currently owns a substantial interest in our voting stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our management team and Board of Directors beneficially own or control (including conversions, options or warrants exercisable or convertible within 60 days) a combined 1,819,825, or 39.8%, of our shares currently outstanding (including conversions, options or warrants exercisable or convertible within 60 days). Sales of significant amounts of shares held by our directors and executive officers, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. Additionally, management has the ability to control any proposals submitted to shareholders, including corporate actions and board changes which may not be in accordance with the votes of other shareholders.\nLitigation may harm our business or otherwise distract management.\nSubstantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and could distract management. For example, lawsuits by licensors, consumers, employees or stockholders could be very costly and disrupt business. While disputes from time to time are not uncommon, we may not be able to resolve such disputes on terms favorable to us.\nOur vendors and licensees may be subject to various laws and government regulations, violation of which could subject these parties to sanctions which could lead to increased costs or the interruption of normal business operations that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur vendors and licensees may operate in a highly regulated environment in the US and international markets. Federal, state and local governmental entities and foreign governments may regulate aspects of their businesses, including the production or distribution of our content or products. These regulations may include accounting standards, taxation requirements (including changes in applicable income tax rates, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations), product safety and other safety standards, trade restrictions, regulations regarding financial matters, environmental regulations, advertising directed toward children, product content, and other administrative and regulatory restrictions. While we believe our vendors and licensees take all the steps necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that they are compliant or will be in compliance in the future. Failure to comply could result in monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could increase our costs or decrease our revenue resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProtecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete in the animated content and entertainment industry depends, in part, upon successful protection of our proprietary and intellectual property. We protect our property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable companies in specific territories and media for limited durations. Despite these precautions, existing copyright and trademark laws afford only limited, or no, practical protection in some jurisdictions. It may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy and distribute our productions or portions of our productions. In addition, although we own most of the music and intellectual property included in our products, there are some titles which the music or other elements are in the public domain and for which it is difficult or even impossible to determine whether anyone has obtained ownership or royalty rights. It is an inherent risk in our industry that people may make such claims with respect to any title already included in our products, whether or not such claims can be substantiated. If litigation is necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and the resulting diversion of resources could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price may be subject to substantial volatility, and stockholders may lose all or a substantial part of their investment.\nOur Common Stock currently trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market. There is limited public float, and trading volume historically has been low and sporadic. As a result, the market price for our Common Stock may not necessarily be a reliable indicator of our fair market value. The price at which our Common Stock trades may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the number of shares available for sale in the market, quarterly variations in our operating results, actual or anticipated announcements of new releases by us or competitors, the gain or loss of significant customers, changes in the estimates of our operating performance, market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our Common Stock may be adversely affected.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may have weaknesses and conditions that could require correction or remediation, the disclosure of which may have an adverse impact on the price of our Common Stock. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require an annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, and for certain issuers an attestation of this assessment by the issuer\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal controls over financial reporting as effective are evolving and complex, and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We expect to incur significant expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. It is difficult for us to predict how long it will take or costly it will be to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to complete the assessment and remediation process on a timely basis. In addition, management\u2019s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our Common Stock.\nWe are authorized to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could adversely impact the rights of holders of our Common Stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock. Any additional preferred stock that we issue in the future may rank ahead of our Common Stock in terms of dividend priority or liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than our Common Stock. In addition, such preferred stock may contain provisions allowing those shares to be converted into shares of Common Stock, which could dilute the value of Common Stock to current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price, if any, of our Common Stock. In addition, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of authorized preferred stock, there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our Common Stock.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our Common Stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting it at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. Our current intention is to apply net earnings, if any, in the foreseeable future to increasing our capital base and development and marketing efforts. There can be no assurance that we will ever have sufficient earnings to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our Common Stock, and in any event, a decision to declare and pay dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. If we do not pay dividends, our Common Stock may be less valuable because the return on investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates.\nOur outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock contains anti-dilution provisions that, if triggered, could cause substantial dilution to our then-existing Common Stock holders which could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock contains anti-dilution provisions to benefit the holders thereof. As a result, if we, in the future, issue Common Stock or grant any rights to purchase our Common Stock or other securities convertible into our Common Stock for a per share price less than the then existing conversion price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, an adjustment to the then current conversion price would occur. This reduction in the conversion price could result in substantial dilution to our then-existing common stockholders as well as give rise to a beneficial conversion feature reported on our statement of operations. Either or both of which could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock may cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144, or shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d and, in anticipation of which, the market price of our Common Stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nIn general, under Rule 144, a non-affiliated person who has held restricted shares of our Common Stock for a period of six months may sell into the market all of their shares, subject to us being current in our periodic reports filed with the Commission.\nAs of March 30, 2017, approximately 3,138,171 shares of Common Stock of the 5,652,091 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding are free trading. Additionally, as of March 30, 2017, there are 1,481,667 shares of Common Stock underlying the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that could be sold pursuant to Rule 144. As of the same date, there are 1,553,359 shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding warrants that could be sold pursuant to Rule 144 to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements. Lastly, as of March 30, 2017, there are 1,373,554 shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding options granted and 69,780 shares reserved for issuance under our Genius Brands International, Inc. Amended 2015 Incentive Plan, all of which are unregistered but will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements and Rule 144 under the Securities Act.", "PERMNO": 16463, "SIC": 7812, "TIC": "GNUS"}
