Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this annual report, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks and uncertainties described in more detail in this annual report:\n\u2022The global COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on the travel industry generally and, as a result, on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022Global economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the hospitality industry could adversely affect demand for travel and lodging, and, as a result, our revenues, profitability, and future growth.\n\u2022Risks relating to natural or man-made disasters, contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist activity, and war could reduce the demand for lodging, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We operate in a highly competitive industry and our revenues, profits, or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively.\n\u2022New distribution channels, alternatives to traditional hotels, significant increases in the volume of sales made through third-party internet travel intermediaries, and industry consolidation among our competitors could have an adverse impact on consumer loyalty to our brand and may negatively impact our business.\n\u2022If we are unable to establish and maintain key distribution arrangements for our properties, the demand for our rooms and our revenues could decrease.\n\u2022Because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the United States, we are subject to various risks of doing business internationally.\n\u2022If we are unable to successfully operate the World of Hyatt loyalty program or further evolve the development and implementation of our digital platforms, loyalty for our brands, and our revenues, could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022Adverse incidents at, or adverse publicity concerning, our properties or our corporate responsibilities could harm our brands and reputation, as well as adversely affect our market share, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\u2022If we are unable to maintain good relationships with third-party property owners and franchisees and/or if our management or franchise agreements terminate, our revenues could decrease and our costs could increase.\n\u2022Some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels or may not open on the anticipated timeline, which could affect our growth prospects.\n\u2022If we or our third-party owners or franchisees are not able to maintain our brand standards or develop, redevelop, or renovate properties successfully, our business, profitability, and ability to compete effectively could be harmed.\n\u2022We may be unable to sell selected properties at acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or within targeted timeframes, and are exposed to risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate.\n\u2022We may seek to expand our business through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties, or through alliances, and these activities may be unsuccessful or divert our management's attention.\n\u2022If we or our third-party owners, franchisees, or development partners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties, access the capital necessary to fund current operations or implement our plans for growth, our revenues, profits, and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed.\n\u2022If we become liable for losses related to loans we have provided or guaranteed to third parties or contractual arrangements with third-party owners and franchisees, our profits could be reduced.\n\u2022Cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of customer, colleague, or Company data could adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, and/or subject us to costs, fines, penalties, investigations, enforcement actions, or lawsuits.\n\u2022Information technology system failures or delays could reduce our revenues and profits and harm the reputation of our brands and our business.\n\u2022We have a limited ability to manage third-party risks associated with our hospitality venture investments, which could reduce our revenues, increase our costs, lower our profits, and/or increase our liabilities.\n\u2022Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow and reduce our operational flexibility, and we are exposed to counterparty and credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.\n\u2022Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs, reduce our profits, or limit our growth.\n\u2022Adverse judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business.\n\u2022Labor shortages or changes in labor laws could disrupt our operations and increase our labor costs.\n\u2022Any failure to protect our trademarks and intellectual property could reduce the value of our brand names and harm our business.\n\u2022There can be no assurance that we will declare or pay dividends in the future or that we will repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase program consistent with historical amounts or at all.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law, as well as agreements with our major stockholders, may discourage or prevent a change of control transaction or any attempt by stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors or management.\n\u2022Pritzker family business interests have substantial control over us and have the ability to control the election of directors and other matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on the travel industry generally and, as a result, on our business and results of operations, and these impacts may persist for an extended period of time or become more pronounced over time.\nThe global spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is complex, unpredictable, and continuously evolving and has resulted in significant disruption and additional risks to our business; the lodging, hospitality, and travel industries; and the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has led governments and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on large gatherings of people, travel bans, border closings and restrictions, business closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing measures. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have significantly reduced global travel and demand for hotel rooms and have had a material detrimental impact on global commercial activity across the lodging, hospitality, and travel industries, all of which has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, operations, and financial results.\nThe extent, duration, and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic's effects will depend on various factors, all of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity, as well as actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic, any additional resurgence, or COVID-19 variants. These factors include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending; governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and our industry; the demand for travel and transient and group business; levels of consumer confidence; the ability of our third-party owners, franchisees, or hospitality venture partners to successfully navigate the effects of the pandemic; the ability to effectively and widely manufacture and distribute vaccines and broad acceptance of the vaccine by the general population; and the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides. Moreover, even after shelter-in-place orders and travel bans and advisories are lifted and vaccines are more widely distributed and available, demand for hotels, including corporate travel and group meetings, may remain depressed for a significant length of time, and we cannot predict if and when demand will return to pre-COVID-19 levels. In addition, we cannot predict whether business travel for in-person meetings will decrease over the long-\nterm due to technological advancements in, and consumer acceptance and adaptation to, virtual meetings and/or changes in guest and consumer preferences.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, operations, and financial condition to a number of significant risks:\n\u2022Revenues and Expenses: With the global spread of COVID-19 beginning in March 2020, we began to experience significant decreases in demand and system-wide Revenue per Available Room (\"RevPAR\") beyond our Greater China properties where the negative impacts first originated. The effects of the pandemic have materially adversely affected, and we expect will continue to materially adversely affect to an extent we are unable to predict, the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties, and revenues may be insufficient to offset certain fixed costs, such as insurance and property taxes. In addition, uncertain or fluctuating real estate valuations and the inability for third-party purchasers to obtain capital may prevent us from selling properties on acceptable terms or prevent us from selling properties within our previously announced timeframes.\nIn addition, the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties has been materially adversely affected, and we expect will continue to be materially adversely affected, by the COVID-19 pandemic. The economic impact of the pandemic has also made it difficult for certain third-party owners or franchisees to meet working capital needs, and could make it difficult for them to service debt obligations or obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could have a significant impact on the overall level, cost, and pace of our future development and, therefore, our ability to increase revenue. The impact of the pandemic could cause third-party owners or franchisees to declare bankruptcy or cause their lenders to declare a default, accelerate the related debt or foreclose on the property. Such bankruptcies, sales or foreclosures could, in some cases, result in the termination of our management or franchise agreements and impact our anticipated income and cash flows. Additionally, third-party owners or franchisees may be, and in limited cases, have been, unable or unwilling to pay us amounts that we are entitled to receive on a timely basis or at all, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our revenues and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused us, and could continue to cause us, to incur additional expenses. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting deterioration in hotel operating performance, we may be, and in limited cases, have been, required to fund shortfalls in operating profit under performance tests or guarantees we have entered into in favor of some third-party owners and franchisees. Moreover, our third-party owners and franchisees could fail to reimburse us for any payments we may be required to make to third-party lenders to whom we made financial guarantees for the timely repayment of all or a portion of the third-party owners' or franchisees' debt related to hotels that we manage or franchise. We have, in limited cases, found it necessary or in the interest of our business to provide financial or other types of support to certain of these parties, and may continue to do so in the future, which could increase our expenses and affect cash flows. While governments have and may continue to implement various stimulus and relief programs, it is uncertain whether and to what extent we or our third-party owners or franchisees will be eligible to participate in, or successfully access, such programs, whether conditions or restrictions imposed under such programs will be acceptable, and whether such programs will be effective in avoiding or significantly mitigating the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we have incurred additional costs related to severance payments and may incur additional expenses related to restructuring activities in future periods. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we or our third-party hotel owners and franchisees could experience other short or longer-term impacts on our costs, including, for example, the need for enhanced health and hygiene standards or certifications, social distancing requirements or other precautionary measures in response to the health and safety challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects could impact our ability to generate profits even after revenues improve.\n\u2022Operations: In response to the significant decline in demand for hotels across our system, we have taken actions and continue to evaluate spending to manage operating expenses and optimize our financial resources. These actions include a permanent reduction in our workforce across our regions, eliminating non-essential spending and corporate initiatives, and reducing costs related to certain system-wide expenses we incur on behalf of third-party owners and franchisees related to marketing, sales, reservations, and technology. We have received, and may continue to receive, demands or requests from labor unions that represent our colleagues, whether in the course of our periodic renegotiation of our collective bargaining agreements or otherwise, for additional compensation, healthcare benefits, or other terms that could increase costs, and we could experience labor disputes or disruptions as we continue to implement our mitigation plans. Some actions we have taken, or that we may take in the future, to reduce costs for us or our third-party owners or franchisees may cause us to experience operational challenges, and may negatively impact guest loyalty, owner preference, or our ability to attract and retain colleagues, and our reputation and market share may suffer as a result. Further, once the effects of the pandemic subside, the recovery\nperiod could be extended and we expect that certain operational changes, particularly with respect to enhanced health and safety measures and global care and cleanliness certifications, will be necessary over the long-term. The challenges of the current operating environment may also adversely impact our ability to maintain brand standards across our portfolio as third-party owners or franchisees may be unwilling or unable to incur the cost of complying with such standards.\n\u2022Financial Condition and Indebtedness: As we manage through the effects of the pandemic, our level of indebtedness has increased and may continue to increase. To enhance our liquidity profile and cash position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on April 21, 2020, we entered into a Second Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \"Revolver Amendment\") and issued $450 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2025 (the \"2025 Notes\") and $450 million of 5.750% senior notes due 2030 (the \"2030 Notes\"). On August 26, 2020, we issued $750 million of three-month LIBOR plus 3.000% senior notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\"). A default under our revolving credit facility would enable the lenders to terminate their commitments thereunder and could trigger a cross-default, acceleration, or other consequences under our other indebtedness or financial instruments. There is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. We also expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to raise equity financing. Changes in the credit ratings of our debt, including our revolving credit facility and outstanding senior notes, could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. As a result of the general economic uncertainty and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our credit ratings have been downgraded. If our credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our credit rating levels, our industry, or our Company, our access to capital and the cost of debt financing would be negatively impacted.\n\u2022Growth: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and could continue to impact, the pace and timing of our growth. The current environment has resulted in, and could continue to result in, difficulties for certain third-party hotel owners and franchisees to obtain commercially viable financing. The commitments of third-party owners, franchisees, and developers with whom we have agreements are subject to numerous conditions, and the eventual development and completion of construction of our pipeline properties is subject to numerous risks, including, in certain cases, obtaining adequate financing. In addition, we are experiencing construction and opening delays as a result of business activity restrictions and supply chain interruptions. As a result, some portion, or all, of our current development pipeline may not be completed and developed into new hotels and those hotels may not open when anticipated or at all, which would impact our net rooms growth. Further, our development pipeline may not grow at the same rate as in the past, and properties in our existing system-wide inventory may exit as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which would also negatively impact our net rooms growth. Even if we are able to successfully grow our pipeline, consumer demand for our rooms may remain depressed or improve at a slower rate than our pipeline growth, resulting in over-supply. In addition, if we cannot access the capital we need to fund our operations or implement our growth strategy, we may need to postpone or cancel planned renovations or developments, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and harm our business.\n\u2022Capital Markets Impact: The global stock markets have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the price of our common stock has been volatile since the onset of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the significant uncertainties it has caused for the global economy, business activity, and business confidence have had, and are likely to continue to have, a significant effect on the market price of securities generally, including our securities. In addition, certain debt covenants restrict our ability to make dividend payments to shareholders or engage in share repurchase activity.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is continuously evolving, and the continuation of the pandemic, any additional resurgence, or COVID-19 variants could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors included in this annual report, which in turn could further materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and profitability, including in ways that are not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks.\nRisks Related to the Hospitality Industry\nWe are subject to macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control as well as the business, financial, operating, and other risks of the hospitality industry, all of which may adversely affect our financial results and growth.\nMacroeconomic and other factors beyond our control as well as the business, financial, operating, and other risks of the hospitality industry can adversely affect demand for hospitality products and services. This includes demand for rooms and services at our portfolio of properties. These factors include:\n\u2022changes and volatility in general economic conditions, including the severity and duration of any downturn in the U.S., Europe, Asia Pacific, or global economy and financial markets;\n\u2022war, political conditions or uncertainty, civil unrest, protests, terrorist activities or threats, and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events;\n\u2022global outbreaks of pandemics or contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or fear of such outbreaks;\n\u2022climate change and resource scarcity, such as water and energy scarcity;\n\u2022natural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, oil spills, and nuclear incidents;\n\u2022changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers;\n\u2022decreased corporate budgets and spending and cancellations, deferrals, or renegotiations of group business;\n\u2022decreased demand for business-related travel due to innovations in business-related technology, such as virtual meetings and/or conferences;\n\u2022low consumer confidence, high levels of unemployment, and depressed housing prices;\n\u2022the financial condition of the airline, automotive, and other transportation-related industries and its impact on travel;\n\u2022decreased airline capacities and routes;\n\u2022increasing awareness around sustainability, the impact of air travel on climate change and the impact of over-tourism;\n\u2022travel-related accidents;\n\u2022oil prices and travel costs;\n\u2022statements, actions, or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and corporate travel-related activities and the resulting negative public perception of such travel and activities;\n\u2022domestic and international political and geo-political conditions, including changes in trade policy;\n\u2022changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, prices, interest rates, or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;\n\u2022the costs and administrative burdens associated with compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022changes in operating costs, including, but not limited to, labor (including minimum wage increases), energy, food, workers' compensation, benefits, insurance, and unanticipated costs resulting from force majeure events;\n\u2022significant increases in cost for healthcare coverage for employees and potential government regulation with respect to health coverage;\n\u2022the lack of availability, or increase in the cost, of capital for us or our existing and potential property owners;\n\u2022the attractiveness of our properties and services to consumers and potential owners and competition from other hotels and alternative lodging marketplaces, including online accommodation search and/or reservation services, and wellness-related businesses;\n\u2022cyclical over-building in the hotel, all-inclusive, and vacation ownership industries; and\n\u2022organized labor activities, which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of group business for our hotels generally as a result of certain labor tactics.\nThese factors, and the reputational repercussions of these factors, can adversely affect, and from time to time have adversely affected, individual properties, particular regions, or our business as a whole. How we manage any one or more of these factors, or any crisis, could limit or reduce demand for the services we provide or the rates our portfolio of properties are\nable to charge for rooms or services, which could adversely affect our financial results and growth. These factors can also increase our costs or affect our ability to develop new properties or maintain and operate our existing portfolio of properties.\nThe hospitality industry is cyclical and adverse global economic conditions or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as cause a decline in or limitation of our future growth.\nConsumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels, and the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a number of trends that negatively impact consumer demand. Changes in consumer demand and general business cycles can subject, and have subjected, our revenues to significant volatility. Adverse general economic conditions, health and safety concerns, risks or restrictions affecting or reducing travel patterns, lower consumer confidence, high unemployment, or adverse political conditions can result in a decline in consumer demand, which can lower the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties and the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties. In addition, expenses associated with managing, franchising, licensing, owning, or leasing hotels as well as residential, vacation, and condominium ownership units are relatively fixed. These costs include personnel costs, interest, rent, property taxes, insurance, and utilities, all of which may increase at a greater rate than our revenues and/or may not be able to be reduced at the same rate as declining revenues. Where cost-cutting efforts are insufficient to offset declines in revenues, we could experience a material decline in margins and reduced or negative cash flows. If we are unable to decrease costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases, the decline in our revenues could have a particularly adverse impact on our net cash flows and profits. This effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth like the United States and other economies are currently experiencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic downturns generally affect the results derived from owned and leased properties more significantly than those derived from managed and franchised properties due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased property and the greater exposure owners have to the properties' performance. Our proportion of owned and leased properties, compared to the number of properties we manage or franchise for third-party owners and franchisees, is larger than that of many of our competitors and, as a result, an economic downturn, like the current one resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a greater adverse effect on our results of operations. As a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles, like the current downturn, can subject, and have subjected, our revenues, earnings, and results of operations to significant volatility.\nUncertainty regarding the future rate and pace of economic growth in different regions of the world makes it difficult to predict future profitability levels. Additionally, if economic weakness were to affect any particular regions of the world, it could have an adverse impact on our revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nIn addition to general economic conditions, new hotel room supply is an important factor that can affect the hospitality industry's performance. Increased or excessive growth in lodging supply could further exacerbate the negative impact of the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and result in returns that are substantially below expectations or result in losses, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and future growth prospects.\nRisks relating to natural or man-made disasters, contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist activity, and war could reduce the demand for lodging, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nHurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires, and other man-made or natural disasters, as well as the spread or fear of spread of contagious diseases in locations where we own, lease, manage, or franchise significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of guests, could cause a decline in the level of business and leisure travel in certain regions or as a whole and reduce the demand for lodging, which may adversely affect our financial and operating performance, as has been the case with the COVID-19 pandemic. See also \"Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic-The global COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on the travel industry generally and, as a result, on our business and results of operations, and these impacts may persist for an extended period of time or become more pronounced over time.\" Actual or threatened war, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a similar effect on our financial condition or our growth strategy. Any one or more of these events may reduce the overall demand for hotel rooms or limit the prices we can obtain for them, both of which could adversely affect our profits and financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCompetition Risks\nBecause we operate in a highly competitive industry, our revenues, profits, or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively, and new distribution channels, alternatives to traditional hotels, and industry consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business.\nThe segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition. Our principal competitors are other operators of full service, select service, extended stay, all-inclusive, and wellness properties, including other major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. Some of these major hospitality chains are larger than we are based on the number of properties or rooms they manage, franchise, own, or lease or based on the number of geographic locations in which they operate. Some of our competitors also have significantly more members participating in their loyalty programs which may enable them to attract more customers and more effectively retain such guests. Our competitors may also have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could adversely affect our ability to compete for guests effectively. In addition to these competitors, we also compete against smaller hotel chains and independent and local hotel owners and operators.\nIncreasingly, we also face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model, such as Alibaba, search engines such as Google, and peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from their owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms, such as Airbnb and HomeAway.\nThe hospitality industry has experienced significant consolidation, and we expect this trend may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in a highly competitive and evolving industry. Consolidation by our competitors would give them increased scale and may enhance their capacity, abilities, and resources and lower their cost structure, causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage. If we lose market share or are not able to successfully attract third-party hotel owners to our brands as a result of this consolidation, our results of operations, cash flow, business, and overall financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nSignificant increases in the volume of sales made through third-party internet travel intermediaries could have an adverse impact on consumer loyalty to our brand and could negatively affect our revenues and profits.\nWe expect to continue to derive most of our business from traditional channels of distribution and our digital platforms. However, consumers worldwide routinely use internet travel intermediaries to book travel. Some of these intermediaries are attempting to increase the importance of generic quality indicators (such as \"four-star downtown hotel\") at the expense of brand identification. These intermediaries hope that consumers will eventually develop brand loyalties to their reservation systems rather than to our brands. Some of these intermediaries have launched their own loyalty programs to further develop loyalties to their reservation systems. In addition, these intermediaries typically obtain higher commissions or other potentially significant contract concessions, increasing the overall cost of these third-party distribution channels. If the volume of sales made through internet travel intermediaries continues to increase, consumers may develop stronger loyalties to these intermediaries rather than to our brands, our distribution costs could increase significantly, and our business revenues and profits could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain key distribution arrangements for our properties, the demand for our rooms and our revenues could fall.\nIncreasingly, the rooms at hotels and resorts that we manage, franchise, own, or lease are booked through third-party internet travel intermediaries and online travel service providers. We also engage third-party intermediaries, including travel agencies and meeting and event management companies, who collect fees by charging our hotels and resorts a commission on room revenues. A failure by our distributors to attract or retain their customer bases could lower demand for hotel rooms and, in turn, reduce our revenues. In addition, some of our distribution agreements are not exclusive, are short term, are terminable at will, or are subject to early termination provisions. The loss of distributors, increased distribution costs, or the renewal of distribution agreements on less favorable terms could adversely impact our business.\nWe compete for guests, management and franchise agreements, and residential, vacation, and condominium ownership properties based on a variety of factors.\nWe compete for guests at our hotels and our resorts and for customers of our services, based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, location, customer satisfaction, room rates, quality of service, amenities, quality of accommodations, security, our cancellation policy, and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points.\nWe compete for management agreements based primarily on the value and quality of our management services, our brand name recognition and reputation, the level of our management fees, the cost of our system-wide services, the terms of our management agreements (including compared to the terms our competitors offer), and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brand name. We compete for franchise agreements based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, the room rate that can be realized, the cost of our system-wide services, and royalty fees charged. Other competitive factors for management and franchise agreements are relationships with property owners and investors, availability and affordability of financing, marketing support, loyalty programs, reservation and e-commerce system capacity and efficiency, distribution channels, limitations on the expansion of one or more of our brands in certain geographic areas due to restrictions previously agreed to in order to secure management and franchise opportunities, and the ability to provide capital that may be necessary to obtain management and franchise agreements.\nThe residential, vacation, and condominium ownership properties which we manage, own, or to which we provide services or license our trademarks compete with other hotel and resort properties principally on the basis of location, quality of accommodations, price, financing terms, quality of service, terms of property use, opportunity to exchange for time at other vacation properties, as applicable, and brand name recognition and reputation. In addition, our residential and condominium ownership properties compete with peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, such as Airbnb, Vrbo, and Vacasa, and residential projects affiliated with branded hospitality companies. Our vacation ownership business also competes with national and independent vacation ownership club operators and owners reselling their interests in these properties, which could reduce demand or prices for new vacation ownership properties.\nOperational Risks\nBecause we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the United States, the risks of doing business internationally, or in a particular country or region, could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits, or disrupt our business.\nWe currently manage, franchise, own, or lease hotels and resorts in 69 countries around the world. Our operations outside the United States represented approximately 16% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. The hotels and resorts we manage, franchise, own, or lease outside of the United States represent approximately 40% of the rooms in our system-wide inventory at December 31, 2020. Over the long term, we expect our international operations may account for an increasing portion of our total revenues and rooms.\nAs a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the United States, including:\n\u2022the costs of complying with laws, regulations, and policies (including taxation policies) of foreign governments relating to investments and operations, the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs, and the impact of various anti-corruption and other laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations or currency restructurings;\n\u2022evolving local data residency requirements that require data to be stored only in and, in some cases, also to be accessed only from within, a certain jurisdiction;\n\u2022U.S. taxation of income earned abroad;\n\u2022limitations on the redeployment of non-U.S. earnings;\n\u2022import and export licensing requirements and regulations, as well as unforeseen changes in regulatory requirements, including imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export regulations, controls, and other trade restrictions;\n\u2022political and economic instability;\n\u2022health and safety protocols, including global care and cleanliness certifications, at our portfolio of properties;\n\u2022the complexity of managing an organization doing business in many jurisdictions;\n\u2022uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for onerous contract clauses; and\n\u2022rapid changes in government, economic, and political policies; political or civil unrest; acts of terrorism; or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation.\nWhile these factors and the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could lower our revenues, affect our operations, increase our costs, reduce our profits, or disrupt our business. For example, in 2020, our financial results were materially adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, conducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations, or restructurings that could have a negative impact on our financial results. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or currency restructurings is expected to continue to grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the United States increases.\nWe occasionally enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions to reduce certain of our exposures to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. However, these hedging agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise and external costs related to executing hedging agreements.\nThe World of Hyatt loyalty program and our digital platforms build loyalty for our brands and drive hotel revenue which could be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully operate the World of Hyatt loyalty program or further evolve the development and implementation of our digital platforms.\nThe World of Hyatt loyalty program is a platform for engagement with our most loyal guests, providing increased benefits and recognition as they continue to engage with Hyatt. We believe World of Hyatt will continue to develop loyalty by fostering personal relationships and creating emotional connections that inspire brand preference. The success of our business depends in part on attracting new consumers, enhancing digital platforms that are preferred by loyalty members, and on continuing participation in the loyalty program by loyalty members. If guests do not accept the loyalty program or if we are unable to operate the loyalty program successfully, our business could be adversely impacted. Further, our digital platforms are focused on driving outstanding guest experiences that differentiate Hyatt and drive revenue through direct bookings, but may not deliver all or part of the expected benefits. If our digital platforms do not evolve in a way that is able to adapt to future technology or keep pace with changes in consumer preferences, our hotel performance could become increasingly challenged.\nAdverse incidents at, or adverse publicity concerning, our properties or our corporate responsibilities could harm our brands and reputation, as well as adversely affect our market share, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain guests and colleagues depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of Hyatt, the quality of our hotels and services, and our corporate and management integrity. An incident involving the potential safety or security of our guests or colleagues, or adverse publicity regarding safety or security at our competitors' properties, or in respect of our third-party vendors or owners and the industry, and any media coverage resulting therefrom, may harm our brands and reputation, cause a loss of consumer confidence in Hyatt and the industry, and negatively impact our results of operations.\nAdditionally, our reputation could be harmed if we fail to, or are perceived to, not comply with various regulatory requirements or if we fail to act responsibly or are perceived as not acting responsibly in a number of areas such as health, safety and security, data security, diversity and inclusion, sustainability, responsible tourism, environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change, human rights, and philanthropy and support for local communities. We manage a broad range of corporate responsibility matters, taking into consideration their expected impact on the sustainability of our business over time, and the potential impact of our business on society and the environment. Adverse incidents with respect to our corporate responsibility efforts could impact the value of our brands or our reputation, the cost of our operations, and relationships with investors and stakeholders, all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe continued expansion in the use and influence of social media has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated and could increase our costs, lead to litigation or governmental investigations, or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation. Adverse incidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Negative incidents could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business, including lost sales, boycotts, reduced enrollment and/or participation in the loyalty program, disruption of access to our digital platforms, loss of development opportunities, or\ncolleague retention and recruiting difficulties. Any decline in the reputation or perceived quality of our brands or corporate image could adversely affect our market share, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nManagement, Franchising, Ownership, Development, and Financing Risks\nIf we are unable to maintain good relationships with third-party property owners and franchisees and/or if we terminate agreements with defaulting third-party property owners and franchisees, our revenues could decrease and we may be unable to maintain or expand our presence.\nWe earn fees for managing and franchising hotels and other properties and expect franchise ownership to continue to increase over time. The viability of our management and franchising business depends on our ability to establish and maintain good relationships with third-party property owners and franchisees. Third-party developers, property owners, and franchisees are focused on maximizing the value of their investment and working with a management company or franchisor that can help them be successful. The effectiveness of our management, the value of our brands, and the rapport we maintain with our third-party property owners and franchisees impact renewals of existing agreements and are also important factors for existing or new third-party property owners or franchisees considering doing business with us. Our relationships with these third parties generate additional management and franchise agreement expansion opportunities that support our growth. As such, if we are unable to maintain good relationships with these third parties, our revenues could decrease or we may be unable to maintain or expand our presence. In addition, if third-party property owners or franchisees breach the terms of our agreements with them, we may elect to exercise our termination rights, which would eliminate our revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these relationships. These risks become more pronounced during economic downturns, such as the current downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nContractual and other disagreements with third-party property owners or franchisees could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses, which could lower our profits.\nOur management and franchise agreements require us and third-party property owners or franchisees to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements. Additionally, some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of third-party hotel properties like us, which means, among other things, that property owners may assert the right to terminate management agreements even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination. In the event of any such termination, we may need to enforce our right to damages or negotiate damages that may not equal expected profitability over the term of the agreement.\nWe generally seek to resolve any disagreements with our third-party property owners or franchisees amicably. Formal dispute resolution occurs through arbitration, if provided under the applicable management or franchise agreement, or through litigation. We cannot predict the outcome of any such arbitration or litigation, the effect of any adverse judgment of a court or arbitrator against us, or the amount of any settlement we may enter into with any third party.\nIf our management or franchise agreements terminate prematurely or we elect to make cure payments due to failures to meet performance tests or upon the occurrence of other stated events, our revenues could decrease and our costs could increase.\nOur management and franchise agreements may terminate prematurely in certain cases. Some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to owners of the hotels we manage upon the occurrence of a stated event, such as the sale of the hotel or our failure to meet a specified performance test.\nGenerally, termination rights under performance tests are based upon the property's individual performance, its performance when compared to a specified set of competitive hotels branded by other hotel operators, or both. Some agreements require a failure of one test, and other agreements require a failure of more than one test, before termination rights are triggered. These termination rights are usually triggered if we do not meet the performance tests over multiple years. Generally, we have the option to cure performance failures by making an agreed-upon cure payment. However, our cure rights may be limited in some cases, and the failure to meet the performance tests may result in the termination of our management agreement. In the past we have (1) failed performance tests, received notices of termination, and elected to make cure payments, (2) failed performance tests and negotiated an alternative resolution, and (3) failed performance tests and elected not to make a cure payment. When any termination notice is received, we evaluate all relevant facts and circumstances at the time in deciding whether to cure. See Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\" for more information related to performance test payments. In addition, some of our management agreements give third-party property owners the right to terminate upon payment of a termination fee to us after a certain period of time, upon sale of the property, or another stated event. Our franchise agreements typically require franchisees to pay a fee to us before terminating. In addition, if an owner files for bankruptcy, our management and franchise agreements may be terminable under\napplicable law. If a management or franchise agreement terminates, we would lose the revenues we derive from that agreement and could incur costs related to ending our relationship with the third party and exiting the property.\nSome of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels or may not open on the anticipated timeline, which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects.\nAt December 31, 2020, our executed contract base consisted of approximately 500 hotels, or approximately 101,000 rooms. The commitments of owners and developers with whom we have agreements are subject to numerous conditions, and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks, including, in certain cases, obtaining governmental and regulatory approvals and adequate financing. As a result, we cannot assure you that our entire development pipeline will be completed and developed into new hotels or that those hotels will open when anticipated, which may impact our net rooms growth. We also cannot assure you that consumer demand will meet the new supply as hotels open. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and could continue to result in, difficulties for certain hotel owners and franchisees to obtain commercially viable financing, which may negatively impact our future development pipeline. See also \"Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic- The global COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on the travel industry generally and, as a result, on our business and results of operations, and these impacts may persist for an extended period of time or become more pronounced over time.\"\nIf we or our third-party owners or franchisees are not able to maintain our current brand standards or we are not able to develop new initiatives, including new brands, successfully, our business and profitability could be harmed.\nWe manage and franchise properties owned by third parties under the terms of management and franchise agreements and expect franchise ownership to continue to increase significantly over time. These agreements require third-party property owners or franchisees to comply with standards that are essential to maintaining our brand integrity and reputation. We depend on third-party property owners or franchisees to comply with these requirements by maintaining and improving properties through investments, including investments in furniture, fixtures, amenities, and personnel. If our third-party property owners or franchisees fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties we manage or franchise, our brand preference and reputation could suffer. Moreover, third-party owners or franchisees may be unwilling or unable to incur the cost of complying with brand standards for new and existing brands as such brands may evolve from time to time. This could result in poor hotel performance or force us to absorb costs to ensure that brand standards come to market in a timely fashion or exert resources to terminate agreements with such third-party owners or franchisees. Moreover, as we continue to increase our franchised hotel presence, our ability to maintain brand standards may become increasingly challenging. Our ability to implement and maintain brand standards across our portfolio of properties is more challenging in the current operating environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, we are continually evaluating and executing new initiatives, including new brands or marketing programs. We have invested capital and resources in owned and leased real estate, property development, brand development, and brand promotion. If such initiatives are not well received by our colleagues, guests, and owners, they may not have the intended effect. We may not be able to recover the costs incurred in developing and launching new brands or other initiatives or to realize their intended or projected benefits, which could lower our profits.\nCertain of our contractual arrangements with third-party owners require us to guarantee payments to the owners if specified levels of operating profit are not achieved by their hotels.\nThe terms of certain guarantees to hotel owners may require us to fund shortfalls if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit. This guaranteed funding to hotel owners may not be recoverable to us and could lower our profits and reduce our cash flows. For example, we previously were subject to a performance guarantee for a portfolio of four managed hotels in France during the first seven years of the management agreements, pursuant to which we made payments to the owner over the term of the guarantee. See Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\" for more information related to our guarantees.\nWe are exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate, which could increase our costs, reduce our profits, limit our ability to respond to market conditions, or restrict our growth strategy.\nOur proportion of owned and leased properties, compared to the number of properties that we manage or franchise for third-party owners and franchisees, is larger than that of many of our competitors. Real estate ownership and leasing is subject to risks not applicable to managed or franchised properties which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, business, and overall financial condition, including:\n\u2022governmental regulations relating to real estate ownership;\n\u2022real estate, insurance, zoning, tax, environmental, and eminent domain laws;\n\u2022the ongoing need for owner funded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties;\n\u2022risks associated with mortgage debt, including the possibility of default, fluctuating interest rate levels, and the availability of replacement financing;\n\u2022risks associated with the possibility that cost increases will outpace revenue increases and that in the event of an economic slowdown, the high proportion of fixed costs will make it difficult to reduce costs to the extent required to offset declining revenues;\n\u2022fluctuations in real estate values or potential impairments in the value of our assets; and\n\u2022the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets.\nWe plan to sell selected properties; however, we may be unable to sell our selected properties at acceptable terms and conditions, if at all.\nAs part of our capital strategy, including our plan announced in March 2019 to sell $1.5 billion in owned assets by March 31, 2022, we plan, from time to time, to sell certain properties, subject to a management or franchise agreement, with the primary purpose of reinvesting the proceeds to support the growth of our business. As we actively market and look to sell selected properties, general economic conditions, such as the current downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with property-specific issues may negatively affect the value of our properties or prevent us from selling the property on acceptable terms or prevent us from selling properties within our previously announced timeframe. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to consummate any such sales on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from such sales. Real estate investments often cannot be sold quickly. Dispositions of real estate assets can be particularly difficult in a challenging economic environment, as financing alternatives are often limited for potential buyers. As a result, economic conditions may prevent potential purchasers from obtaining financing on acceptable terms, if at all, thereby delaying or preventing our ability to sell the properties selected for disposition. Our inability to sell assets, or to sell such assets at attractive prices, could have an adverse impact on our ability to realize proceeds for reinvestment, return of capital to shareholders, or repayment of debt, and ultimately to execute on our long-term strategy. In addition, even if we are successful in consummating sales of selected properties, such dispositions may result in losses. Further, as we continue to manage through the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our level of indebtedness has increased and may continue to increase, and proceeds from any asset sales may be used to repay certain indebtedness.\nWe may seek to expand our business through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties, or through alliances, and these activities may be unsuccessful or divert our management's attention.\nWe consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other businesses, properties, brands, or other assets as part of our growth strategy. For example, in 2018, we acquired Two Roads Hospitality LLC (\"Two Roads\") and in 2017, we acquired Miraval. We may also pursue opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties. In many cases, we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Acquisitions of or investments in hospitality companies, businesses, properties, brands, or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:\n\u2022spending cash and incurring debt;\n\u2022assuming contingent liabilities;\n\u2022contributing properties or related assets to hospitality ventures that could result in recognition of losses;\n\u2022creating additional transactional and operating expenses; or\n\u2022issuing shares of stock that could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments, or alliances. There may be high barriers to entry in many key markets and scarcity of available development and investment opportunities in desirable locations. Similarly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all, or that the ability to obtain financing will not be restricted by the terms of our revolving credit facility or other indebtedness we may incur.\nThe success of any such acquisitions or investments will also depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations. Inability to integrate completed acquisitions in an efficient and timely manner could result in reputational harm or have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Integration efforts may also take longer than we anticipate and involve unexpected costs. If we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired business, we may not realize the benefits that were expected at the time of acquisition. We may experience difficulty with integrating acquired businesses, properties, or other assets, including difficulties relating to:\n\u2022coordinating sales, distribution, loyalty, and marketing functions;\n\u2022effectively and efficiently integrating information technology and other systems;\n\u2022issues not discovered as part of the transactional due diligence process and/or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies of acquired businesses, including with respect to commercial disputes or cyber incidents and information technology failures or other matters; and\n\u2022preserving the important licensing, distribution, marketing, owner, customer, labor, and other relationships of the acquired assets.\nIn addition, as a result of any acquisition activity, we may assume management and franchise agreements with terms that are not as favorable as other agreements within our portfolio and may result in loss of business over time. Any such acquisitions, investments, or alliances could also demand significant attention from our management team that would otherwise be available for our regular business operations, which could harm our business.\nTiming, budgeting, and other risks could result in delays or cancellations of our efforts to develop, redevelop, or renovate the properties that we own or lease, or make these activities more expensive, which could reduce our profits or impair our ability to compete effectively.\nWe must maintain and renovate the properties that we own and lease in order to remain competitive, maintain the value and brand standards of our properties, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. We also selectively undertake ground-up construction of properties together with hospitality venture partners in an effort to expand our brand presence. These efforts are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022construction delays or cost overruns (including labor and materials) that may increase project costs;\n\u2022obtaining zoning, occupancy, and other required permits or authorizations;\n\u2022changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand or negative project returns;\n\u2022governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development;\n\u2022multi-year urban redevelopment projects, including temporary hotel closures, that may significantly disrupt hotel profits;\n\u2022force majeure events, including earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, tsunamis, or pandemics; and\n\u2022design defects that could increase costs.\nAdditionally, developing new properties typically involves lengthy development periods during which significant amounts of capital must be funded before the properties begin to operate and generate revenue. If the cost of funding new development exceeds budgeted amounts, and/or the time period for development is longer than initially anticipated, our profits could be reduced. Further, due to the lengthy development cycle, intervening adverse economic conditions may alter or impede our development plans, thereby resulting in incremental costs to us or potential impairment charges. Moreover, during the early stages of operations, charges related to interest expense and depreciation may substantially detract from, or even outweigh, the profitability of certain new property investments.\nSimilarly, the cost of funding renovations and capital improvements may exceed budgeted amounts. Additionally, the timing of renovations and capital improvements can affect, and historically has affected, property performance, including occupancy and ADR, particularly if we need to close a significant number of rooms or other facilities, such as ballrooms, meeting spaces, or restaurants. Moreover, the investments that we make may fail to improve the performance of the properties in the manner that we expect.\nEconomic and other conditions may adversely impact the valuation of our assets resulting in impairment charges that could have a material adverse impact on our results from operations.\nWe hold significant amounts of goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment, and investments. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assets for impairment based on various factors, including actual operating results, trends of projected revenues and profitability, and potential or actual terminations of underlying management and franchise agreements. During times of economic distress, declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values. As a result, we have incurred impairment charges, and may incur charges in the future, which could be material and may adversely affect our earnings.\nIf our third-party property owners and franchisees, including our hospitality venture partners, are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties, our revenues, profits, and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed.\nMany of the properties owned by third-parties, franchisees, or our hospitality ventures are pledged as collateral for mortgage loans entered into when such properties were purchased or refinanced. If our third-party property owners, franchisees, or our hospitality venture partners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all, the lenders could declare a default, accelerate the related debt, and repossess the property. Any sales or repossessions could, in certain cases, result in the termination of our management or franchise agreements and eliminate anticipated income and cash flows, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nIf we or our third-party owners, franchisees, or development partners are unable to access the capital necessary to fund current operations or implement our plans for growth, our profits could be reduced and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished.\nThe hospitality industry is a capital-intensive business requiring significant capital expenditures to develop, operate, maintain, and renovate properties. Access to the capital that we or our third-party owners, franchisees, or development partners need to finance the construction of new properties or to maintain and renovate existing properties is critical to the continued growth of our business and our revenues.\nThe availability of capital or the conditions under which we or our third-party owners, franchisees, or development partners can obtain capital can have a significant impact on the overall level, cost, and pace of future development and therefore the ability to grow our revenues. The most recent economic downturn caused credit markets to experience significant disruption severely reducing liquidity and credit availability and the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and could continue to result in, difficulties for certain third-party hotel owners and franchisees to obtain commercially viable financing. Such disruptions may diminish the ability and desire of existing and potential development partners to access capital necessary to develop properties. Our ability to access additional capital could also be limited by the terms of our revolving credit facility, which restricts our ability to incur debt under certain circumstances. Additionally, if one or more of the financial institutions that support our revolving credit facility fail, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would reduce the availability of funds that we can borrow under the facility.\nIf we are forced to spend larger than anticipated amounts of cash from operating activities to operate, maintain, or renovate existing properties, then our ability to use cash for other purposes, including acquisition or development of other businesses, properties, brands, or other assets could be limited and our profits could be reduced. Similarly, if we cannot access the capital we need to fund our operations or implement our growth strategy, we may need to postpone or cancel planned renovations or developments, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and harm our business.\nIf we become liable for losses related to loans we have provided or guaranteed to third parties, our profits could be reduced.\nAt times, we make loans to our third-party hotel owners or franchisees for hotel development expenditures when we enter into management or franchise agreements with third parties, including hospitality ventures. In other circumstances, we may also provide senior secured financing or subordinated forms of financing (also referred to as mezzanine financing) to third-party owners or franchisees. We could suffer losses if third-party property owners or franchisees default on loans that we provide. Additionally, we may provide financial guarantees to third-party lenders related to the timely repayment of all or a portion of the associated debt of certain of our properties. The guarantees may be for the full amount of the debt or may be limited to a portion of the debt. We typically obtain reimbursement agreements from our partner(s) or other third parties with the intent to limit our exposure to our share of the debt. See Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\" for more information related to our loans and other financing arrangements and \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\" for more information related to our guarantees.\nWe are exposed to counterparty and credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.\nCash balances not required to fund our daily operating activities are invested in interest-bearing investments with a greater focus placed on capital preservation than on investment return. The majority of our cash and cash equivalent balances are held on deposit with high quality financial institutions that hold long-term ratings of at least BBB or Baa from S&P or Moody's, respectively, and in AAA-rated money market funds. As such, we are exposed to counterparty risk on our cash and cash equivalent balances. We also have established investment accounts for purposes of investing portions of cash resources for the World of Hyatt loyalty program, certain benefit programs, and our captive insurance company. Although we have not recognized any significant losses to date on these investments, any significant declines in their market values could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results. Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of our investments could decline and result in impairments, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results.\nTechnology and Information Systems Risks\nCyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of customer, colleague, or Company data could adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, and/or subject us to costs, fines, penalties, investigations, enforcement actions, or lawsuits.\nWe collect, use, and retain large volumes of customer data, including payment card numbers and other personal information for business, marketing, and other purposes, and our various information technology systems capture, process, summarize, and report such data. We also maintain personal information and other data about our colleagues. We store and process such customer, colleague, and Company data both at onsite facilities and at third-party owned facilities including, for example, in third-party hosted cloud environments. We also rely on the availability of information technology systems to operate our business, including communications, reservations, digital platforms, including the loyalty program, guest services, payments, and other general operations. The integrity and protection of customer, colleague, and Company data, as well as the continuous operation of our systems, are critical to our business. Our customers and colleagues expect we will adequately protect their personal information and that our services will be continuously available.\nThe regulations and contractual obligations applicable to security and privacy are increasingly demanding, both in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we operate, and cyber threat actors regularly target the hospitality industry. In addition, the scope and complexity of the cyber-threat landscape could affect our ability to adapt to and comply with changing regulatory obligations and expectations. Because of the scope and complexity of our information technology structure, our reliance on third parties to support and protect our structure and data, and the constantly evolving cyber-threat landscape, our systems may be vulnerable to disruptions, failures, unauthorized access, cyber-terrorism, human error, negligence, fraud, or other misuse. Moreover, our systems, colleagues, and customers may be targeted by social engineering attacks or account takeover tactics that may, among other things, aim to obtain funds or information fraudulently. These or similar occurrences, whether accidental or intentional, could result in an interruption in the operation of our systems or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, and fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, colleague, or Company data, all of which could impact our business, result in operational inefficiencies or loss of business, create negative publicity, cause harm to our reputation, or subject us to remedial and other costs, fines, penalties, investigations, enforcement actions, or lawsuits. Additionally, we increasingly rely on franchisees and licensees who operate their own networks and engage with their own service providers, and a security incident involving such networks could affect our reputation and result in operational inefficiencies or loss of business.\nWe have disclosed prior incidents involving cyber threat actors who have attacked our systems, as well as those operated by third-parties, to gain access to devices that process payment card or other data. We expect ongoing attempts to gain access to our systems and those operated by our third-party owners, franchisees, licensees, and vendors. We continue to use an evolving privacy and security risk management framework utilizing risk assessments to identify priorities for enhancements, including enhancement efforts that involve implementing technologies such as payment card tokenization and point-to-point encryption, advanced endpoint detection, network segmentation, and secure web and email gateways. While we implement security measures designed to safeguard our systems and data, and intend to continue implementing additional measures in the future, our implementation efforts may be incomplete or our measures may not be sufficient to maintain the confidentiality, security, or availability of the data we collect, store, and use to operate our business. We work to continuously evaluate our security posture throughout our business and make appropriate changes to our operating processes and improve our defenses. We maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for cyber risks related to the theft, loss, and fraudulent, or unlawful use of customer, colleague, or Company data in our systems, but future occurrences could result in costs and business impacts that may not be covered or may be in excess of any available insurance that we may have arranged. As a result, future incidents could have a material impact on our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation technology system failures, delays in the operation of our information technology systems, or system enhancement failures could reduce our revenues and profits and harm the reputation of our brands and our business.\nOur success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems. For example, we depend on our central reservation system, which allows bookings by hotels directly, via telephone through our global contact centers, by travel agents, through our digital platforms, and through our online reservations partners. In addition, we depend on information technology to run our day-to-day operations, including, among others, hotel services and amenities such as guest check-in and check-out, housekeeping and room service, and systems for tracking and reporting our financial results and the financial results of our hotels.\nOur information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, and similar events. The occurrence of any of these natural or man-made disasters or unanticipated problems at any of our information technology facilities or any of our global contact centers could cause interruptions or delays in our business, loss of data, or render us unable to process reservations.\nIn addition, if our information technology systems are unable to provide the information communications capacity that we need or if our information technology systems suffer problems caused by installing system enhancements, we could experience similar failures or interruptions. If our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures or if our property and business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brands and our business could be harmed.\nIf we fail to stay current with developments in technology necessary for our business, our operations could be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished.\nSophisticated information technology and other systems are instrumental for the hospitality industry, including systems used for our central reservations, revenue management, property management, and global loyalty program, as well as technology systems that we make available to our guests. These information technology and other systems must be refined, updated, or replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis. Developing and maintaining these systems may require significant capital. If we are unable to replace or introduce information technology and other systems as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs or schedules when these systems become outdated or require replacement, or if we are unable to achieve the intended benefits of any new information technology or other systems, our operations could be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished.\nHospitality Venture Risks\nWe have a limited ability to manage third-party risks associated with our hospitality venture investments, which could reduce our revenues, increase our costs, lower our profits, and/or increase our liabilities.\nWe participate in numerous hospitality ventures with third parties. We may also buy and develop properties in hospitality ventures with the sellers of the properties, affiliates of the sellers, developers, or other third parties. Our hospitality venture partners may have shared or majority control over the operations of our hospitality ventures. As a result, our investments in hospitality ventures involve risks that are different from the risks involved in investing in real estate independently. These risks include the possibility that our hospitality ventures or our partners:\n\u2022go bankrupt or otherwise are unable to meet their capital contribution obligations, especially in times of adverse economic conditions;\n\u2022have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our business interests or goals;\n\u2022are in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, our requests, our policies, our objectives, or applicable laws;\n\u2022subject the property to liabilities exceeding those contemplated;\n\u2022take actions that reduce our return on investment; or\n\u2022take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business.\nFor these and other reasons, it could be more difficult for us to sell our interest in any hospitality venture or to pursue the venture's activities, which could reduce our ability to address any problems we may have with those properties or respond to market conditions in the future and could lead to impairments of such investments. As a result, our investments in hospitality\nventures could lead to impasses with our partners or situations that could harm the hospitality venture, which could reduce our revenues, increase our costs, and lower our profits.\nIn addition, in conjunction with financing obtained for our hospitality ventures, we may provide completion guarantees, debt repayment guarantees, or standard indemnifications to lenders for loss, liability, or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the other hospitality venture owners.\nIf our hospitality ventures fail to provide accurate and/or timely information that is required to be included in our financial statements, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results.\nPreparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of our hospitality ventures. Any deficiencies in our hospitality ventures' internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud. Such deficiencies could also result in restatements of, or other adjustments to, our previously reported or announced financial results, which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our shares. Additionally, if our hospitality ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or file our periodic reports in a timely manner.\nCash distributions from our hospitality ventures could be limited by factors outside our control that could reduce our return on investment and our ability to generate liquidity from these hospitality ventures.\nAlthough our hospitality ventures may generate positive cash flow, in some cases, these hospitality ventures may be unable to distribute that cash to the hospitality venture partners. Additionally, in some cases, our hospitality venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the hospitality venture rather than distribute it. Because our ability to generate liquidity from our hospitality ventures depends on the hospitality ventures' ability to distribute capital to us, tax considerations or decisions of our hospitality venture partners could reduce our return on these investments. We include our pro rata share of Adjusted EBITDA attributable to our unconsolidated owned and leased hospitality ventures in our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA regardless of whether the cash flow of those ventures is, or can be, distributed to us.\nIndebtedness Risks\nOur debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow and reduce our operational flexibility and changes affecting the availability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") may have consequences that we cannot yet reasonably predict.\nThe terms of the indenture governing our Senior Notes (as described in Part IV, Item 15, \"Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedule-Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements\") and those of our revolving credit facility subject us to the following:\n\u2022a risk that cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest;\n\u2022restrictive covenants, including covenants related to certain financial ratios. See Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for further information related to restrictions under our financial covenants; and\n\u2022the risk that any increase in the interest rate applicable to any borrowings under our revolving credit facility could reduce our cash flows available for other corporate purposes, including investments in our portfolio, could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures, or could increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced.\nAlthough we anticipate we will be able to repay or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures, there can be no assurance we will be able to do so, or that the terms of such refinancing will be favorable.\nA substantial decrease in operating cash flow, consolidated EBITDA (as defined in our revolving credit facility), or a substantial increase in our expenses may make it difficult for us to meet our existing debt service requirements and restrictive covenants. As a result, we could be forced to sell assets and/or modify our operations. Our existing leverage may also impair our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, or other purposes, if necessary, or require us to accept terms otherwise unfavorable to us.\nAdditionally, a portion of our indebtedness, as well as certain derivative instruments and the terms of our revolving credit facility bear interest at fluctuating interest rates, some of which are tied to LIBOR. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of LIBOR\nafter 2021. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration, the FCA-regulated and authorized administrator of LIBOR, announced its intention to cease publication of 1 week and 2 month LIBOR settings at the end of 2021, with other USD settings to cease on June 30, 2023. As a result, LIBOR may perform differently than in the past and may ultimately cease to be utilized or to exist, either during or after 2021. Alternative benchmark rate(s) may replace LIBOR and could affect our agreements that rely on LIBOR, not all of which contain alternative rate provisions. Certain of our agreements rely on LIBOR and, at this time, it is not possible for us to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, any phase out of LIBOR, or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates. There is uncertainty about how we, the financial markets, applicable law, and the courts will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on contracts that do not include alternative rate provisions. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds, our receipts or payments under agreements that rely on LIBOR, and the valuation of derivative or other contracts to which we are a party, any of which could impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nRating agency downgrades may increase our cost of capital.\nThe interest rate on borrowings and the facility fee under our revolving credit facility are determined by a pricing grid, which is dependent in part on our credit ratings by Standard & Poor's Financial Services, LLC, a subsidiary of McGraw Hill Financial, Inc. (\"S&P\"), and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (\"Moody's\"). Lower ratings result in a higher cost of funds. Therefore, if these independent rating agencies were to downgrade our credit ratings or if we no longer have a credit rating from either agency, the cost of our borrowing and the amount of the facility fee under our revolving credit facility will increase as specified in the pricing grid. In 2020, both rating agencies that cover us downgraded our credit rating as part of a sector downgrade resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a negative impact on our cost of borrowing. Any future downgrade of our credit ratings by the rating agencies could reduce or limit our access to capital and further increase our cost of capital.\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Insurance\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs, reduce our profits, or limit our growth.\nOur business, properties, and colleagues are subject to a variety of laws and regulations around the globe. Generally, these laws and regulations address our sales and marketing and advertising efforts, our handling of privacy issues and customer data, our anti-corruption efforts, our ability to obtain licenses for business operations such as sales of food and liquor, and matters relating to immigration, the environment, health and safety, health care, gaming, competition, and trade, among other things. Our collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations, and privacy law is an area that changes often and varies significantly by jurisdiction. Increasingly, there is potential for increased exposure to fines, penalties, and civil judgments as a result of new privacy regulations. Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our properties and services to our guests.\nOur franchising and licensing businesses and our international operations are also subject to laws and regulations affecting those businesses:\nFranchising\nOur franchising business is subject to various laws, as well as to regulations enacted by the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\"). The FTC also regulates the manner and substance of our disclosures to prospective franchisees. In addition, a number of U.S. states and foreign countries require franchisors to register the franchise offering with the applicable governmental body and/or to make extensive disclosures to potential franchisees in connection with offers and sales of franchises in those states and countries. Further, a number of U.S. states and countries have \"franchise relationship laws\" or \"business opportunity laws\" that, among other restrictions, limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of agreements. Failure to comply with those laws, where applicable, can limit a franchisor's ability to enter into new franchise agreements or enforce the terms of existing franchise agreements and may create liability for fines, penalties, and civil judgments.\nVacation Ownership\nOur licensed vacation ownership properties are subject to extensive state regulation in both the state in which the property is located and the states in which the property is marketed and sold. Marketing for these properties is also subject to federal regulation of certain marketing practices, including federal telemarketing regulations.\nInternational Operations\nOur business operations in countries outside the United States are subject to a number of U.S. federal laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") and the Commerce Department. The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials or parties and requires public companies in the United States to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies' transactions. OFAC and the Commerce Department administer and enforce economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations, and individuals. Some of our business operations are also subject to the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the U.K. Bribery Act and anti-corruption legislation in the countries in which we conduct operations.\nIf we, or our hospitality ventures, fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational harm, incarceration of our colleagues, or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties, including the termination of our management, franchise, and ownership rights. These restrictions could increase our costs of operations, reduce our profits, or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support our growth.\nAdverse judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business.\nIn the normal course of our business, we are often involved in various legal proceedings. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these proceedings were to be determined adversely to us or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we could become the subject of future claims by third parties, including current or former third-party property owners or franchisees, guests who use our properties, our employees, our investors, or regulators. Any significant adverse judgments or settlements would reduce our profits and could limit our ability to operate our business. Further, we may incur costs related to claims for which we have appropriate third-party indemnity if such third parties fail to fulfill their contractual obligations.\nChanges in federal, state, local, or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law, or agreements or disputes with tax authorities could affect our profitability and financial condition by increasing our tax costs.\nOur global operations subject us to income and non-income based taxes such as sales, use, value added, goods and services, payroll, property, and franchise taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Our future tax expenses and liabilities could be affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of the tax laws, as well as changes in our business operations. Our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes to our global transfer pricing methodology, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including net operating losses, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, the U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application thereof, such as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (\"BEPS\") being undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Legislative and tax treaty changes and the interpretation thereof, including any new U.S. tax legislation put forth by the new administration, could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law or interpretation and could adversely impact profitability. State and local tax authorities have also increased their efforts to increase revenues through changes in tax law and audits. Such changes and proposals, if enacted, could increase our future tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to on-going and periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and various state, local, and foreign tax authorities and currently are engaged in disputes with certain of such tax authorities. We are a party to certain agreements with tax authorities that reduce or defer the amount of tax we pay. The ultimate results of these agreements, or the expiration of such agreements, or changes in circumstances or in the interpretation of such agreements, could increase our tax costs. We believe we have established adequate reserves for potential tax liabilities, but the final amount of taxes, including interest and penalties, assessed and paid could exceed the amount of such reserves, which could reduce our profits and cash position.\nNegotiations of collective bargaining agreements, attempts by labor organizations to organize additional groups of our colleagues, or changes in labor laws could disrupt our operations, increase our labor costs, or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies.\nCertain of our properties are subject to collective bargaining agreements, similar agreements, or regulations enforced by governmental authorities. If relationships with our colleagues, other field personnel, or the unions that represent them become adverse, the properties we manage, own, or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes, lockouts, and public demonstrations. Labor disruptions, which are generally more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being renegotiated, could harm our relationship with our colleagues or cause us to lose guests. Further, adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Labor regulation, including minimum wage legislation, could lead to higher wage and benefit costs, changes in work rules that raise operating expenses, legal costs, and limitations on our ability or the ability of our third-party property owners and franchisees to take cost saving measures during economic downturns. Collective bargaining agreements may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues.\nWe and our third-party property owners and franchisees may also become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements in the future. Potential changes in the federal regulatory scheme could make it easier for unions to organize groups of our colleagues. If such changes take effect, more of our colleagues or other field personnel could be subject to increased organizational efforts, which could potentially lead to disruptions or require more of our management's time to address unionization issues. These or similar agreements, legislation, or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations, hinder our ability to cross-train and cross-promote our colleagues due to prescribed work rules and job classifications, reduce our profitability, or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies.\nOur franchisees and their hotel operators also currently may be or may become subject to collective bargaining agreements. Labor disruptions, labor regulation, and negotiation of labor agreements may be disruptive to a franchisee's operations which could impact our franchised fee income or harm our reputation. We do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by third-party property owners and franchisees.\nAny failure to protect our trademarks and intellectual property could reduce the value of our brand names and harm our business.\nThe reputation and perception of our brands are critical to our success in the hospitality industry. We regularly apply to register our trademarks in the United States and other countries. However, we cannot assure you that those trademark registrations will be granted or that the steps we take to protect our trademarks or intellectual property in the United States and other countries will be adequate to prevent others, including third parties or former colleagues, from copying or using our trademarks or intellectual property without authorization. Our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized use in some countries outside the United States, where we may not be adequately protected by local law. If our trademarks or intellectual property are copied or used without authorization, the value of our brands, their reputation, our competitive advantages, and our goodwill could be harmed.\nMonitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could be costly, force us to divert our resources, lead to counterclaims or other claims against us, or otherwise harm our business.\nThird-party claims that we infringe their intellectual property rights could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses.\nThird parties may make claims against us for infringing their intellectual property rights. Any such claims, even those without merit, could:\n\u2022be expensive and time consuming to defend;\n\u2022force us to stop providing products or services that use the intellectual property that is being challenged;\n\u2022force us to redesign or rebrand our products or services;\n\u2022divert our management's attention and resources;\n\u2022force us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use a third-party's intellectual property; or\n\u2022force us to pay significant damages.\nIn addition, we may be required to indemnify third-party owners and franchisees of the hotels we manage or franchise for any losses they incur as a result of any such third-party infringement claims. Any necessary royalty or licensing agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms. Any costs, lost revenues, changes to our business, or management attention related to intellectual property claims against us, whether successful or not, could impact our business.\nThe extensive environmental requirements to which we are subject could increase our environmental costs and liabilities, reduce our profits, or limit our ability to run our business.\nOur operations and properties are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations of various federal, state, local, and foreign governments, including requirements addressing:\n\u2022health and safety;\n\u2022the use, management, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes;\n\u2022discharges of waste materials into the environment, such as refuse or sewage;\n\u2022water discharge and supply; and\n\u2022air emissions.\nWe could be subject to liability under some of these laws for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous substances or wastes on, under, or in real property we currently or formerly manage, own, or develop, or third-party sites where we sent hazardous substances or wastes for disposal. We could be held liable under these laws regardless of whether we knew of, or were at fault in connection with, the presence or release of any such hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Some of these laws make each covered person responsible for all of the costs involved, even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination. Furthermore, a person who arranges for hazardous substances or wastes to be transported, disposed of, or treated offsite, such as at disposal or treatment facilities, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation if those substances are released into the environment by third parties at such disposal or treatment facilities. The presence or release of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, or the failure to properly clean up such materials, could cause us to incur significant costs, or jeopardize our ability to develop, use, sell, or rent real property we own, lease, or operate or to borrow using such property as collateral.\nOther laws and regulations require us to manage, abate, or remove materials containing hazardous substances such as mold, lead, or asbestos during demolitions, renovations, or remodeling at properties that we manage, own, lease, or develop or to obtain permits for certain of our equipment or operations. The costs of such management, abatement, removal, or permitting could be substantial. Further, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from violations of environmental regulations or from contamination associated with one or more of our properties. Complying with these laws and regulations, or addressing violations arising under them, could increase our environmental costs and liabilities, reduce our profits, or limit our ability to run our business. Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted or new more stringent laws and regulations related to global climate change, air quality, or other environmental, health, and safety concerns may be adopted or become applicable to us. The identification of new areas of contamination, a change in the extent or known scope of contamination or changes in cleanup requirements, or the adoption of\nnew requirements governing our operations could have a material adverse effect on our results or operations, financial condition, and business.\nIf the insurance that we, our owners, hospitality ventures, franchisees, or licensees carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities involving properties that we own, lease, manage, or franchise, our profits could be reduced.\nWe, our owners, hospitality ventures, and our franchisees and licensees carry insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary. Nevertheless, market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we, our owners, hospitality ventures, our franchisees, or licensees can obtain or restrict our ability, our owners', our hospitality ventures', our franchisees', or licensees' ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates. In the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage that we, our owners, hospitality ventures, franchisees, or licensees carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations, our liabilities, or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property loss. In addition, there are other risks or losses, such as those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, that may fall outside of the general coverage limits of our policies, may be uninsurable, or with respect to which the cost of insurance is too expensive to justify. In some cases, these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured. As a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues, profits, management fees, franchise fees, or license fees from the property, we could remain obligated for performance guarantees in favor of third-party property owners and franchisees or for their debt or other financial obligations, suffer an uninsured or underinsured property loss, or we may not have sufficient insurance to cover awards or damages resulting from our liabilities. If the insurance that we, our owners, hospitality ventures, franchisees, or licensees carry does not sufficiently cover damages or other losses or liabilities, our profits could be adversely affected.\nThe Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 could result in investigations by the U.S. Government against our Company and could harm our reputation and brands.\nThe Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (\"ITRSHR Act\") expanded sanctions against Iran and Syria. In addition, the ITRSHR Act instituted disclosure requirements in annual and quarterly reports for public companies engaged in, or affiliated with an entity engaged in certain activities involving the Government of Iran, or involving other entities and persons targeted under certain OFAC sanctions, or otherwise involving specified activities under the ITRSHR Act. A company subject to Section 219 of the ITRSHR Act must make detailed disclosures about certain activities knowingly conducted by it or any of its affiliates. We did not identify any 2020 activities required to be disclosed. In the event Hyatt were to engage in certain activities that are subject to disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of the ITRSHR Act and Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, we would be required to separately file, concurrently with any ITRSHR Act disclosure, a notice to the SEC that such activities were disclosed in our quarterly or annual report filings, which notice must also contain the information required by Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act. The SEC is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the President and certain Congressional committees. The President thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and, within 180 days of initiating such an investigation, to determine whether sanctions should be imposed on the Company. Disclosure of such activities, even if they are not subject to sanctions under applicable law, and any sanction actually imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities, could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Share Ownership and Other Stockholder Matters\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile, and holders of Class A common stock may not be able to resell shares at or above the price paid.\nThe stock market in general, and hospitality companies in particular, including us, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the underlying businesses. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our Class A common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, companies that own or lease a greater proportion of properties have at times experienced disproportionate volatility and price and volume fluctuations, and we expect this dynamic to continue. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn addition to the risks described in this section, several factors that could cause the price of our Class A common stock in the public market to fluctuate significantly include, among others, the following:\n\u2022quarterly variations in our operating results compared to market expectations;\n\u2022annual variations in our operating results compared to our guidance;\n\u2022withdrawals or suspensions of our guidance;\n\u2022announcements of acquisitions of or investments in other businesses and properties or dispositions;\n\u2022announcements of new services or products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022size of our public float;\n\u2022future conversions to and sales of our Class A common stock by current holders of Class B common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of Class B common stock intend to sell shares;\n\u2022stock price performance of our competitors;\n\u2022fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes in the United States and abroad;\n\u2022low investor confidence;\n\u2022default on our indebtedness or foreclosure of our properties;\n\u2022changes in senior management or key personnel;\n\u2022downgrades or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or negative reports published by securities analysts about our business or the hospitality industry in general;\n\u2022negative earnings or other announcements by us or other hospitality companies;\n\u2022downgrades in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our competitors;\n\u2022issuances or repurchases of equity or debt securities;\n\u2022a decision to pay or not to pay dividends;\n\u2022cyber incidents and information technology failures;\n\u2022terrorist activities or threats of such activities, civil or political unrest, or war; and\n\u2022global economic, legal, and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nVolatility in the market price of our Class A common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their Class A common stock at or above the price at which they purchased the stock. As a result, investors may suffer a loss on their investment.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company's securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, reduce our profits, divert our management's attention and resources, and harm our business.\nThere can be no assurance that we will declare or pay dividends in the future or that we will repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase program consistent with historical amounts or at all.\nWe suspended all dividend payments beginning in the second quarter of 2020, and suspended all share repurchase activity effective March 3, 2020. The terms of the Revolver Amendment restrict our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares through the first quarter of 2021. Our dividend policy or share repurchase program may change from time to time, and we may not declare dividends or repurchase shares in any particular amounts, in amounts consistent with historical practice, or at all. Our repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares and the timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, applicable debt covenants, the timing and amount of cash proceeds from asset dispositions, the timing and amount of any like-kind exchange transactions and other tax-planning matters, the trading price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities, and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments or repurchase activity could have a negative effect on our stock price, increase volatility, or fail to enhance shareholder value. The actual declaration and payment of future dividends, the amount of any such dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, if any, are subject to determination by our board of directors after its review of our business strategy, applicable debt covenants, financial performance and position, and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. Our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties, including: deterioration of our financial performance or position, inability to declare a\ndividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants, an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash, and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in the best interest of our shareholders.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our stock price and trading volume.\nSecurities research analysts have established and publish their own quarterly projections for our business. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match securities research analysts' projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who writes reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, or the hospitality industry in general, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our Company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law, as well as agreements with our major stockholders, may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if a sale of Hyatt would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as agreements with our major stockholders, contain provisions that may make it difficult to remove our board of directors and management and may discourage or delay \"change of control\" transactions that certain stockholders may view as beneficial or could involve the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class ownership structure, in which our Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share and our Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. As a result of this structure, our major stockholders have significant influence or actual control over matters requiring stockholder approval.\n\u2022Voting agreements entered into with or among our major stockholders require these stockholders to vote their shares consistent with the recommendation of our board of directors, assuming in certain instances that a majority of a minimum of three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) or, in the case of transactions involving us and an affiliate, all of such minimum of three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker) agree with the recommendation. While the voting agreements are in effect, they may provide our board of directors with effective control over matters requiring stockholder approval.\n\u2022Lock-up agreements entered into with stockholders party to our 2007 Stockholders' Agreement limit the ability of these stockholders to sell their shares to any person who would be required to file a Schedule 13D with the SEC disclosing an intent to acquire the shares other than for investment purposes and, in certain instances, to competitors of ours in the hospitality, lodging, or gaming industries.\n\u2022Stockholders party to our 2007 Stockholders' Agreement have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, to \"standstill\" provisions that prevent the stockholders from acquiring additional shares of our common stock, making or participating in acquisition proposals for us, or soliciting proxies in connection with meetings of our stockholders, unless the stockholders are invited to do so by our board of directors.\n\u2022Our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving for a staggered three-year term, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at an annual meeting.\n\u2022Our directors may be removed only for cause, which prevents stockholders from being able to remove directors without cause other than those directors who are being elected at an annual meeting.\n\u2022Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors. As a result, holders of our Class B common stock will control the election of directors and the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to elect director candidates will be limited.\n\u2022Vacancies on our board of directors, and any newly created director positions created by the expansion of the board of directors, may be filled only by a majority of remaining directors then in office.\n\u2022Actions to be taken by our stockholders may only be effected at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders and not by written consent.\n\u2022Special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by the Chairman of the Board or by our corporate secretary at the direction of our board of directors.\n\u2022Advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors and propose matters to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company.\n\u2022Our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue series of preferred stock, or rights to acquire preferred stock, that could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, holders of our common stock or could also be used as a method of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change of control.\n\u2022An affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote is required to amend any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws.\nPritzker family business interests have substantial control over us and have the ability to control the election of directors and other matters submitted to stockholders for approval, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters or result in actions that you do not believe to be in our interests or your interests.\nOur Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share and our Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. At January 31, 2021, Pritzker family business interests beneficially own, in the aggregate, 59,768,523 shares, or approximately 96.3%, of our Class B common stock, and 127,436 shares, or 0.3%, of Class A common stock, representing approximately 59.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock and approximately 90.6% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, consistent with the voting agreements contained in the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement and the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement, Pritzker family business interests will be able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant transaction. While the voting agreements are in effect, they may provide our board of directors with the effective control over matters requiring stockholder approval. Because of our dual class ownership structure, Pritzker family business interests will continue to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own less than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and the interests of Pritzker family business interests may not coincide with our interests or your interests. As a result, we may take actions that you do not believe to be in our interests or your interests and that could depress our stock price. See also \"-Voting agreements entered into with or among our major stockholders, including Pritzker family business interests, will result in a substantial number of our shares being voted consistent with the recommendation of our board of directors, and may limit your ability to influence the election of directors and other matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\"\nIn addition, the difference in the voting rights between our Class A common stock and Class B common stock could diminish the value of the Class A common stock to the extent that investors or any potential future purchasers of our common stock ascribe value to the superior voting rights of the Class B common stock.\nDisputes among Pritzker family members and among Pritzker family members and the trustees of the Pritzker family trusts may result in significant distractions to our management, disrupt our business, have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock, and/or generate negative publicity about Hyatt and the Pritzker family.\nIn the past, disputes have arisen between and among certain Pritzker family members, and between and among beneficiaries of the Pritzker family trusts and the trustees of such trusts, with respect to, among other things, the ownership, operation, governance, and management of certain Pritzker family business interests. In connection with certain of these disputes, claims were alleged, and in certain cases, proceedings were initiated, against certain Pritzker family members, including Thomas J. Pritzker, our executive chairman, and other Pritzker family members, some of whom have been or are our directors, and against the trustees, including Thomas J. Pritzker in his former capacity as a co-trustee of the Pritzker family U.S. situs trusts. Such past allegations related to, among others, trust management and administration and violations of certain trustee duties, including fiduciary duties. Some of these disputes led to significant negative publicity for the Pritzker family. These disputes were resolved with no admissions or finding of any misconduct.\nDisputes among Pritzker family members, and between and among beneficiaries of the Pritzker family trusts and the trustees of such trusts, including with respect to Hyatt, may arise or continue in the future. If such disputes occur, they may result in significant distractions to our management, disrupt our business, have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock, and/or generate negative publicity about Hyatt and Pritzker family members, including Pritzker family members involved with Hyatt.\nVoting agreements entered into with or among our major stockholders, including Pritzker family business interests, will result in a substantial number of our shares being voted consistent with the recommendation of our board of directors, and may limit your ability to influence the election of directors and other matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nPritzker family business interests, which beneficially own at January 31, 2021, directly or indirectly, 59,895,959 shares, or 59.1% of our total outstanding common stock and control approximately 90.6% of our total voting power, have entered into a voting agreement with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned by Pritzker family business interests. During the term of the voting agreement, which expires on the date upon which more than 75% of the Company's fully diluted shares of common stock is owned by non-Pritzker family business interests, Pritzker family business interests have agreed to vote their shares of our common stock consistent with the recommendation of our board of directors with respect to all matters (assuming agreement as to any such matter by a majority of a minimum of three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker)) or, in the case of transactions involving us and an affiliate, assuming agreement of all of such minimum of three independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker). In addition, at January 31, 2021, the stockholders party to the 2007 Stockholder's Agreement beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 3.7% of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 3.4% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock. Pursuant to the 2007 Stockholder's Agreement, the stockholders party thereto have entered into a voting agreement with us, with respect to the shares of common stock that they beneficially own, and have agreed to vote their shares of common stock consistent with the recommendation of our board of directors, without any separate requirement that our independent directors agree with the recommendation. These voting agreements expire on the date that Thomas J. Pritzker is no longer chairman of our board of directors. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Stockholder Agreements.\"\nWhile the voting agreements are in effect, they may provide our board of directors with effective control over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant transaction. This is because the number of our shares that are required by the voting agreements to be voted consistent with the recommendation of our board of directors will be sufficient to determine the outcome of the election of directors and other matters submitted to stockholders for approval. This will limit your ability to influence the election of directors and other matters submitted to stockholders for approval, even if you do not believe those actions to be in our interests or your interests. For instance, the voting agreements may have the effect of delaying or preventing a transaction that would result in a change of control, if our board of directors does not recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of the transaction, even if you or some or all of our major stockholders believe that the transaction is in our interests or your interests. On the other hand, the voting agreements may result in our stockholders approving a transaction that would result in a change of control, if our board of directors recommends that our stockholders vote in favor of the transaction, even if you or some or all of our major stockholders believe that the transaction is not in our interests or your interests.\nA significant number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of Class B common stock could be sold into the market, which could depress our stock price even if our business is doing well.\nFuture sales in the public market of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of Class B common stock, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of Class B common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock. At January 31, 2021, we had 39,261,233 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 62,038,918 shares of Class B common stock outstanding.\nAt January 31, 2021, 37,811,649 shares of Class A common stock are freely tradable in the public market without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") unless these shares are held by any of our \"affiliates,\" as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act (\"Rule 144\"). The remaining 1,449,584 outstanding shares of Class A common stock and 62,038,918 outstanding shares of Class B common stock are deemed \"restricted securities,\" as that term is defined in Rule 144. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 or Rule 701 under the Securities Act (\"Rule 701\"). Of these restricted securities, 2,270,395 shares of Class B common stock are held by shareholders party to the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement and are otherwise eligible to be sold at any time, subject to the applicable rights of first refusal, \"drag along\" rights and other restrictions contained in the 2007 Stockholders' Agreement. See Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Stockholder Agreements-2007 Stockholders' Agreement.\" Another 1,422,153 shares of Class A common stock that are deemed restricted securities are otherwise eligible to be sold at any time.\nThe rest of the restricted securities, consisting of 59,768,523 shares of Class B common stock and 27,431 shares of Class A common stock, together with 100,005 shares of Class A common stock previously registered, are subject to contractual lock-up and certain other restrictions contained in the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement and the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement as described in Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Stockholder Agreements.\" These contractual restrictions may be amended, waived, or terminated by the parties to those agreements in accordance with the terms of such agreements without our consent and without notice; the 25% limitation on sales of our common stock may, with respect\nto each 12 month period, be increased to a higher percentage or waived entirely by the unanimous affirmative vote of our independent directors (excluding for such purposes any Pritzker). All such shares of Class A common stock, including shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B common stock, will be eligible for resale in compliance with Rule 144 or Rule 701 to the extent the lock-up restrictions contained in the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement or the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement, as applicable, are waived or terminated with respect to such shares.\nAssuming the lock-up restrictions contained in the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement and the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement are not amended, waived, or terminated and that there are no transfers of shares amongst Pritzker family stockholders, and further assuming the parties to these agreements sell the maximum amount permitted to be sold during the first time period that such shares are eligible to be sold as set forth below, and subject to any applicable restrictions contained in such agreements and the provisions of Rule 144 and/or Rule 701, the securities eligible to be sold by Pritzker family stockholders under the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement and the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement will be available for sale in the public market as follows:\n*The foregoing numbers are based on information at January 31, 2021 and assume that the maximum number of shares permitted to be sold during each period set forth above are, in fact, sold during each such period. To the extent any shares are not sold during the first time period that such shares are eligible to be sold as described above, the number of shares that may be sold in subsequent time periods may change.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2020, 8,109,881 shares of our Class A common stock were reserved for issuance under the Fourth Amended and Restated Hyatt Hotels Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended, the \"LTIP\"). These shares of Class A common stock will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued or awarded under our LTIP, subject to provisions of various award agreements and Rule 144, as applicable. In addition, 919,397 shares of our Class A common stock were reserved for issuance under the Hyatt Hotels Corporation Second Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\"), 1,169,195 shares of our Class A common stock remained available for issuance pursuant to the Amended and Restated Hyatt Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (\"DCP\"), and 300,000 shares of Class A common stock remained available for issuance pursuant to the Hyatt International Hotels Retirement Plan (commonly known as the Field Retirement Plan) (\"FRP\").\nIf any of these holders causes a large number of securities to be sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock. These sales also could impede our ability to raise future capital. See also \"-If holders of shares of our Class B common stock convert their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock and exercise their registration rights, a significant number of shares of our Class A common stock could be sold into the market, which could reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital.\"\nWe also may issue shares of our Class A common stock from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares that we may issue may in turn be significant.\nIf holders of shares of our Class B common stock convert their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock and exercise their registration rights, a significant number of shares of our Class A common stock could be sold into the market, which could reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital.\nHolders of 62,038,918 shares of our Class B common stock (or 61.2% of our total outstanding shares of common stock at January 31, 2021), including Pritzker family business interests, have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements registering sales of shares of Class A common stock acquired upon conversion of such Class B common stock or to include sales of such shares of Class A common stock in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or for other stockholders. In order to exercise such registration rights, the holder must be permitted to sell shares of its common stock under applicable lock-up restrictions. See \"-A significant number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of Class B common stock could be sold into the market, which could depress our stock price even if our business is doing well\" and Part I, Item 1, \"Business-Stockholder Agreements\" for additional information with respect to these lock-up provisions. Subject to compliance with applicable lock-up agreements, shares of Class A common stock sold under the registration statements can be freely sold in the public market. In the event such registration rights are exercised and a large number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B common stock are sold in the public market, such sales could reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock. These sales also could impede our ability to raise future capital. Additionally, we will bear all expenses in connection with any such registrations (other than underwriting discounts).\nFollowing our decision in May 2020 to file a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act, certain stockholders party to the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of October 12, 2009, among Hyatt and the Pritzker family business interests party thereto, elected to exercise their piggyback registration rights with respect to 13,347,885 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B common stock. On May 21, 2020, the Company filed an automatic effective shelf registration statement with the SEC to register the resale of such aggregate 13,347,885 shares. In connection with such registration, all other holders of registration rights, including trustees of trusts for the benefit of Thomas J. Pritzker and his lineal descendants (including Jason Pritzker), elected not to exercise their piggyback registration rights.\nSubsequent to November 2020,(i) a limited partnership and a trust, each for the benefit of Daniel F. Pritzker and/or certain of his lineal descendants, and Daniel F. Pritzker, individually, engaged in sales, charitable contributions and similar transactions representing an aggregate of 583,333 shares of Class A common stock and/or Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B common stock and (ii) the Anthony N. Pritzker Family Foundation engaged in sales representing an aggregate of 299,027 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B common stock. After giving effect to these transactions, as well as sales prior to November 2020 by (a) a limited partnership and a trust, each for the benefit of Daniel F. Pritzker and/or certain of his lineal descendants, that resulted in such entities holding fewer shares than are registered for resale on the May 2020 shelf registration statement, and (b) the Anthony N. Pritzker Family Foundation that resulted in such entity no longer holding any shares registered for resale on the May 2020 shelf registration statement, as of the date of this filing, 11,019,678 shares of the 13,347,885 shares originally registered for resale on the May 2020 shelf registration statement continue to be eligible to be sold pursuant to the May 2020 shelf registration statement during the 12 month period commencing November 5, 2020 through November 4, 2021 under the lock-up restrictions contained in the Amended and Restated Global Hyatt Agreement and the Amended and Restated Foreign Global Hyatt Agreement. Subsequent to November 4, 2021, and assuming no further sales, 11,019,678 shares of the 13,347,885 shares originally registered for resale on the May 2020 shelf registration statement will continue to be eligible to be sold pursuant to the May 2020 shelf registration statement. Additional shares may be registered on the shelf registration statement in the future as such shares are eligible to be sold in accordance with the registration rights agreements and lock-up restrictions. See \"-A significant number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of Class B common stock could be sold into the market, which could depress our stock price even if our business is doing well\" for additional information with respect to the lock-up provisions.\nThe sale of shares registered under the registration statement in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur could reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock or impede our ability to raise future capital.\nNon-U.S. holders who own more than 5% of our Class A common stock or substantial amounts of our Class B common stock may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain realized on the disposition of such stock.\nBecause we have significant U.S. real estate holdings, we may be a \"United States real property holding corporation\" (\"USRPHC\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but we have made no determination to that effect. There can be no assurance that we do not currently constitute or will not become a USRPHC. As a result, a \"non-U.S. holder\" may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain realized on a disposition of our Class A common stock if such non-U.S. holder has owned, actually or constructively (through certain family members, related entities and options), more than 5% of our Class A common stock at any time during the shorter of (a) the five-year period ending on the date of disposition and (b) the non-U.S. holder's holding period in such stock.\nIf we were or were to become a USRPHC, a non-U.S. holder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain realized on the disposition of our Class B common stock. Such tax would apply if on the date such non-U.S. holder actually or constructively acquired Class B common stock, and on any date on which such non-U.S. holder acquires additional Class B common stock, the aggregate fair market of the Class B common stock it actually and constructively owns is greater than 5% of the fair market value of our Class A common stock on such date. Certain dispositions of substantial amounts of Class B common stock by non-U.S. holders may be subject to withholding under section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nLabor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could reduce our profits.\nOur success depends in large part on the ability to attract, retain, train, manage, and engage our colleagues. Our properties are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by thousands of colleagues around the world. If we and our franchisees are unable to attract, retain, train, and engage skilled colleagues, our and our franchisees' ability to manage and staff properties adequately could be impaired, which could reduce customer satisfaction. Staffing shortages could also hinder our ability to grow and expand our business. Because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our properties, a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs, which could reduce our profits and the profits of our third-party owners or franchisees.\nThe loss of our senior executives or key field personnel, such as our general managers, could significantly harm our business.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts and skills of our senior executives. We have entered into employment letter agreements with certain of our senior executives. However, we cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us. Finding suitable replacements for our senior executives could be difficult. We currently do not have a life insurance policy or key person insurance policy with respect to any of our senior executives. Losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect our strategic relationships, including relationships with our third-party property owners, franchisees, hospitality venture partners, and vendors, and limit our ability to execute our business strategies.\nWe also rely on the general managers at each of our managed properties to run daily operations and oversee our colleagues. These general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide. The failure to retain, train, or successfully manage our general managers for our properties could negatively affect our operations.", "PERMNO": 93098, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "H"}
