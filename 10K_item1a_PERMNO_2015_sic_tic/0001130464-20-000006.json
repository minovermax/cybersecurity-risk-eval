Risks that may adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows are described below. These risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports filed with the SEC should be considered for a better understanding of our Company.\nOur continued success is dependent on execution of our strategic business plans and growth strategy.\nOur results of operations depend, in significant part, on our ability to execute our strategic business plans and growth strategy. Technology advancements, disruptive forces and innovations in the marketplace and changing business or regulatory conditions may negatively impact our current plans and strategies. An inability to successfully and timely adapt to changing conditions and execute our strategic plans and growth strategy could materially affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe may be subject to unfavorable federal and state regulatory outcomes.\nOur regulated Electric and Gas Utilities are subject to cost-of-service regulation and earnings oversight from federal and eight state utility commissions. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of desired earnings levels. Our retail electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. The rates that we are allowed to charge may or may not match our related costs and allowed return on invested capital at any given time. While rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that our various regulatory authorities will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will result in full recovery of our costs and the allowed return on invested capital. In addition, rate decisions could be influenced by many factors, including general economic conditions and the political environment.\nEach of our Electric and Gas Utilities are permitted to recover certain costs (such as increased fuel and purchased power costs) outside of a base rate review. To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to our customers, and the state utility commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by the customers, we may be required to refund such costs. Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe may be subject to future laws, regulations, or actions associated with fossil-fuel generation and GHG emissions.\nWe own and operate regulated and unregulated electric power plants that burn fossil fuels (natural gas and coal) and a surface mine that extracts and sells coal. We also purchase and deliver natural gas to our customers. These business activities are subject to evolving public concern regarding fossil fuels, GHG emissions (such as carbon dioxide and methane) and their impact on the climate.\nIncreased rules and regulations associated with fossil fuels and GHG emissions could result in the impairment or retirement of some of our existing or future transmission, distribution, generation and storage facilities or coal mine. Further, these rules could create the need to purchase or build clean-energy fuel sources to fulfill obligations to our customers. These actions could also result in increased operating costs which could adversely impact customers and our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nOur financial performance depends on the successful management of our facilities operations, including ongoing operation, construction, expansion, and refurbishment.\nOperation, construction, expansion and refurbishment of electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas transmission and distribution systems, natural gas storage facilities, and a coal mine involve risks that could result in fires, explosions, property damage and personal injury, including death. These risks include:\n\u2022\nInherent dangers. Electricity and natural gas are dangerous for employees and the general public; contact with power lines, natural gas pipelines, electrical or natural gas service facilities and equipment can result in fires and explosions, causing significant property damage and personal injuries, including death;\n\u2022\nWeather, natural conditions and disasters. Severe weather events could negatively impact operations, including our ability to provide energy safely and reliably and our ability to complete construction, expansion or refurbishment of facilities as planned. Extreme natural conditions and other disasters such as wind, lightning, flooding and winter storms, can cause wildfires, electric transmission or distribution pole failures, natural gas pipeline interruptions, outages, property damage and personal injury;\n\u2022\nOperating hazards. Operating hazards such as leaks, mechanical problems and accidents, including fires or explosions could impact employee and public safety, reliability and customer confidence;\n\u2022\nLabor and labor relations. The cost of recruiting and retaining skilled technical labor or the unavailability of such resources could have a negative impact on our operations. Our ability to transition and replace our retirement-eligible utility employees is a risk; at December 31, 2019, approximately 25% of our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities employees were eligible for regular or early retirement. Our ability to avoid or minimize supply interruptions, work stoppages and labor disputes is also a risk; approximately 25% of our employees are represented by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements.\n\u2022\nEquipment and processes. Breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the unavailability or increased cost of equipment, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency could negatively impact our results of operations. New plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment, including newer environmental emission control technology.\n\u2022\nDisrupted transmission and distribution. We depend on transmission and distribution facilities, including those operated by unaffiliated parties, to deliver the electricity and gas that we sell to our retail and wholesale customers. If transmission is interrupted physically, mechanically, or with cyber means, our ability to sell or deliver product and satisfy our contractual obligations may be hindered;\n\u2022\nNatural gas supply for generation and distribution. Our utilities purchase natural gas from a number of suppliers for our generating facilities and for distribution to our customers. Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by the lack of availability and cost of natural gas, and disruptions in the delivery of natural gas due to various factors, including but not limited to, transportation delays, labor relations, weather and environmental regulations, which could limit our utilities\u2019 ability to operate their facilities;\n\u2022\nReplacement power. The cost of supplying or securing replacement power during scheduled and unscheduled outages of generation facilities could negatively impact our results of operations;\n\u2022\nGovernmental permits. The inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals along with the cost of complying with or satisfying conditions imposed upon such approvals could negatively impact our ability to operate and our results of operations;\n\u2022\nOperational limitations. Operational limitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements and contractual agreements, including those that restrict the timing of generation plant scheduled outages, could negatively impact our results of operations;\n\u2022\nIncreased costs. Increased capital and operating costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental and pipeline safety laws and regulations; unexpected engineering, environmental and geological problems; and unanticipated cost overruns could negatively impact our results of operations;\n\u2022\nPublic opposition. Opposition by members of public or special-interest groups could negatively impact our ability to operate our businesses.\n\u2022\nDisruption in the functioning of our information technology and network infrastructure which is vulnerable to disability, failures and unauthorized access. If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions.\nThe ongoing operation of our business involves the risks described above, in addition to risks associated with threats to our overall business model, such as electrification initiatives. Any of these risks could cause us to experience negative financial results and damage to our reputation and public confidence. These risks could cause us to incur significant costs or be unable to deliver energy and/or operate below expected capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues or cause us to incur higher operating and maintenance costs and penalties. While we maintain insurance and obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance and our rights under contracts, warranties or performance guarantees may not be timely or adequate to cover lost revenues, increased expenses, liability or liquidated damage payments.\nOur energy production, transmission and distribution activities, and our storage facilities for our natural gas involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other catastrophic events.\nInherent in our businesses are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, blowouts, fires, releases of hazardous materials, explosions and operational problems. Many of our transmission and distribution assets are located near populated residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites.\nThese hazards could result in injury or loss of human life, cause environmental pollution, significantly damage property or natural resources or impair our ability to operate our facilities. While we maintain liability and property insurance coverage, such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. The occurrence of any of these events may not be fully covered by our insurance and could have a material adverse effect on our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nCustomer growth and usage in our service territories may fluctuate with current economic conditions, emerging technologies or responses to price increases.\nOur financial operating results are impacted by demand in our service territories. Customer growth and usage may be impacted by a number of factors, including the voluntary reduction of consumption of electricity and natural gas by our customers in response to increases in prices and energy efficiency programs, economic conditions impacting customers\u2019 disposable income and the use of distributed generation resources or other emerging technologies. Continued technological improvements may make customer and third-party distributed generation and energy storage systems, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines, solar cells and batteries, more cost effective and feasible for our customers. If more customers utilize their own generation, demand for energy from us would decline. Such developments could affect the price of energy and delivery of energy, require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. Each of these factors could materially affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nCyberattacks, terrorism, or other malicious acts could disrupt our operations, or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information.\nTo effectively operate our business, we rely upon a sophisticated electronic control system, SCADA, information technology systems and network infrastructure to collect and retain sensitive information including personal information about our customers and employees. Cyberattacks, terrorism or other malicious acts targeting electronic control systems could result in a full or partial disruption of our electric and/or gas operations. Attacks targeting other key information technology systems, including our third-party vendors\u2019 information systems, could further add to a full or partial disruption of our operations. Any disruption of these operations could result in a loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, as well as significant expense to repair system damage and remedy security breaches. Any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, shareowner, employee or proprietary data could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.\nWe have instituted security measures and safeguards to protect our operational systems and information technology assets, including certain safeguards required by FERC. The security measures and safeguards we have implemented may not always be effective. Despite our implementation of security measures and safeguards, all of our information technology systems may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access\nRisks associated with deployment of capital may impact our ability to execute our business plans and growth strategy.\nWe have significant capital investment programs planned for the next five years. The successful execution of our capital investment strategy depends on, or could be affected by, a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to: extreme weather conditions, effective management of projects, availability of qualified construction personnel including contractors, changes in commodity and other prices, governmental approvals and permitting and regulatory cost recovery.\nWeather conditions may cause fluctuation in customer usage as well as service disruptions.\nOur utility businesses are seasonal businesses and weather conditions and patterns can have a material impact on our operating performance. Demand for electricity is typically greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating, respectively. Demand for natural gas depends heavily upon winter-weather patterns throughout our service territory and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season. Accordingly, our utility operations have historically generated lower revenues and income when weather conditions are cooler than normal in the summer and warmer than normal in the winter. Demand for natural gas is also impacted by summer weather patterns that are cooler than normal and provide higher than normal precipitation; both of which can reduce natural gas demand for irrigation. Unusually mild summers and winters, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nOur businesses are located in areas that could be subject to severe weather events such as snow and ice storms, tornadoes, strong winds, significant thunderstorms, flooding and drought. These events could result in lost operating revenues due to outages, property damage, including inoperable generation facilities and downed transmission and distribution lines, and storm restoration activities. We may not be able to recover the costs incurred following these weather events resulting in a negative impact on our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe may be subject to increased risks of regulatory penalties.\nBusiness activities in the energy sector are heavily regulated, primarily by agencies of the federal government. Many agencies employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations. The FERC, NERC, CFTC, EPA, OSHA, SEC and MSHA may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nCertain Federal laws provide special protection to certain designated animal species. These laws and any state equivalents provide for significant civil and criminal penalties for non-permitted activities that result in harm to or harassment of certain protected animals, including damage to their habitats. If such species are located in an area in which we conduct operations, or if additional species in those areas become subject to protection, our operations and development projects, particularly transmission, generation, wind and pipeline projects, could be restricted or delayed, or we could be required to implement expensive mitigation measures.\nMunicipal governments may seek to limit or deny our franchise privileges.\nMunicipal governments within our utility service territories possess the power of condemnation and could establish a municipal utility within a portion of our current service territories by limiting or denying franchise privileges for our operations and exercising powers of condemnation over all or part of our utility assets within municipal boundaries. We regularly engage in negotiations on renewals of franchise agreements with our municipal governments. We have from time to time faced challenges or ballot initiatives on franchise renewals. To date, we have been successful in resolving or defending each of these challenges. Although condemnation is a process that is subject to constitutional protections requiring just and fair compensation, as with any judicial procedure, the outcome is uncertain. If a municipality sought to pursue this course of action, we cannot assure that we would secure adequate recovery of our investment in assets subject to condemnation. We also cannot quantify the impact that such action would have on the remainder of our business operations.\nFINANCING RISKS\nA sub-investment grade credit rating could impact our ability to access capital markets.\nOur issuer credit rating is Baa2 (Stable outlook) by Moody\u2019s; BBB+ (Stable outlook) by S&P; and BBB+ (Stable outlook) by Fitch. Reduction of our credit ratings could impair our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and complete new financings on reasonable terms, if at all. A credit rating downgrade, particularly to sub-investment grade, could also result in counterparties requiring us to post additional collateral under existing or new contracts. In addition, a ratings downgrade would increase our interest expense under some of our existing debt obligations, including borrowings under our credit facilities, potentially significantly increasing our cost of capital and other associated operating costs.\nDerivatives regulations could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.\nDodd-Frank contains significant derivatives regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared resulting in a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as \u201cmargin\u201d) for such transactions. Dodd-Frank provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users such as utilities and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions.\nWe use derivative instruments for our hedging activities for our Gas and Electric Utilities\u2019 operations. We may also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations. As a result of Dodd-Frank regulations promulgated by the CFTC, we may be required to post collateral for certain swap transactions we enter into. In addition, our exchange-traded futures contracts are subject to futures margin posting requirements, which could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price uncertainty and to protect cash flows. Requirements to post collateral may cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or may require us to increase our level of debt. In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing our profitability.\nOur hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity price and financial market risks may cause fluctuations in reported financial results due to mark-to-market accounting treatment.\nWe use various financial contracts and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps to manage commodity price and financial market risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always match up with the gains or losses on the commodities being hedged. Fluctuating commodity prices could have a negative effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses.\nFrom time to time, we have sought to limit a portion of the potential adverse effects resulting from changes in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other hedging mechanisms. To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor. In addition, even though they are closely monitored by management, our hedging activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement, the hedge is economically imperfect, commodity prices or interest rates move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions, or hedging policies and procedures are not followed.\nMarket performance or changes in key valuation assumptions could require us to make significant unplanned contributions to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.\nAssumptions related to interest rates, expected return on investments, mortality and other key actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our funding requirements and the expense recognized related to these plans. An adverse change to key assumptions associated with our defined benefit retirement plans may require significant unplanned contributions to the plans which could adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe have a holding company corporate structure with multiple subsidiaries. Corporate dividends and debt payments are dependent upon cash distributions to the holding company from the subsidiaries.\nAs a holding company, our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets. Our operating cash flow and ability to service our indebtedness depend on the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, each subsidiary\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any applicable contractual or regulatory restrictions that may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash, working capital, equity or debt service funds.\nThere is no assurance as to the amount, if any, of future dividends because they depend on our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition and are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. See \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d within Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these restrictions and their impact on our liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain financing on reasonable terms needed to refinance debt, fund planned capital expenditures or otherwise execute our operating strategy.\nOur ability to execute our operating strategy is highly dependent upon our access to capital. Historically, we have addressed our liquidity needs (including funds required to make scheduled principal and interest payments, refinance debt, pay dividends and fund working capital and planned capital expenditures) with operating cash flow, borrowings under credit facilities, proceeds of debt and equity offerings and proceeds from asset sales. Our ability to access the capital markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including changes in our credit ratings, changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies, volatility in commodity or electricity prices and general economic and market conditions.\nIn addition, because we are a holding company and our utility assets are owned by our subsidiaries, if we are unable to adequately access the credit markets, we could be required to take additional measures designed to ensure that our utility subsidiaries are adequately capitalized to provide safe and reliable service. Possible additional measures would be evaluated in the context of then-prevailing market conditions, prudent financial management and any applicable regulatory requirements.\nNational and regional economic conditions may cause increased counterparty credit risk, late payments and uncollectible accounts.\nA future recession, if one occurs, may lead to an increase in late payments from retail, commercial and industrial utility customers, as well as from our non-utility customers. If late payments and uncollectible accounts increase, earnings and cash flows from our continuing operations may be reduced.\nOur ability to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. Our insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses.\nOur ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost of such insurance, could be impacted by developments affecting insurance businesses, international, national, state or local events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all, or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available to us. A loss for which we are not fully insured could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject, including but not limited to environmental hazards, fire-related liability from natural events or inadequate facility maintenance, distribution property losses, cyber-security risks and dangers that exist in the gathering and transportation of gas in pipelines.\nCosts associated with our healthcare plans and other benefits could increase significantly.\nThe costs of providing healthcare benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to healthcare plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. Significant regulatory developments have, and likely will continue to, require changes to our current employee benefit plans and in our administrative and accounting processes. Our electric and gas utility rates are regulated on a state-by-state basis by the relevant state regulatory authorities based on an analysis of our costs, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Within our utility rates we have generally recovered the cost of providing employee benefits. As benefit costs continue to rise, there can be no assurance that the state public utility commissions will allow recovery. The increasing cost, or inadequate recovery of, rising employee benefit costs may adversely affect our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow, or liquidity.\nAn effective system of internal control may not be maintained, leading to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to make an assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of these controls. During their assessment of these controls, management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify areas of weakness in control design or effectiveness, which may lead to the conclusion that a material weakness in internal control exists. Any control deficiencies we identify in the future could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. If we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, market perception of our business, operating results and stock price could be adversely affected.\nENVIRONMENTAL RISKS\nDevelopments in federal and state laws concerning GHG regulations and air emissions relating to climate could materially increase our generation costs and render some of our generating units uneconomical to operate and maintain.\nTo the extent climate change occurs, our businesses could be adversely impacted. Warmer temperatures during the heating season in our utility service territories, or cooler temperatures during the cooling season in our electric service territories could adversely affect financial results through lower natural gas volumes delivered, lower MWh sold and associated lower revenues.\nWe own and operate regulated and non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants in Colorado, South Dakota and Wyoming. Developments under federal and state laws and regulations governing air emissions from fossil-fuel generating plants may result in more stringent emission limitations, which could have a material impact on our costs of operations. Various pending or final state and EPA regulations that will impact our facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the section \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d.\nThere is uncertainty surrounding current climate regulation due to legal challenges, new federal climate legislation anticipated in the future, or state climate legislation and regulation. We cannot definitively estimate the effect of GHG legislation or regulation on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nNew or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources, the closure or reduction of load of coal-fired power generation facilities and potential increased load of our combined cycle natural gas-fired generation units. To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements. We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility and other purchasers of the power generated by those non-regulated power plants. Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain; this could cause those generating units to be de-commissioned, potentially resulting in impairment costs. We will attempt to recover any remaining asset value; however, any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe costs to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future governmental laws, regulations or requirements, or failure to comply, could increase significantly.\nOur business segments are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations may result in increased capital, operating and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the business segments to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets.\nThe business segments may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and contracts with customers. More stringent environmental laws or regulations could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or impede the development of new facilities. Although it is not expected that the costs to comply with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the business segments\u2019 financial position, results of operations or cash flows, future environmental compliance costs could have a significant negative impact.\nThe characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion or utilization.\nFuture regulations may require further reductions in emissions of mercury, hazardous pollutants, SO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter and GHG, which are released into the air when coal is burned. These requirements could require the installation of costly emission control technology or the implementation of other measures.\nCoal competes with other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, solar and hydropower. The EPA was directed to repeal, revise and replace the CPP rule. At this time, it is not known what effect this will have on coal as a domestic energy source, and could have a significant impact on our mining operations.\nExisting or proposed legislation focusing on emissions enacted by the United States or individual states could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for our customers and could impose a tax or fee on the producer of the coal. If our customers decrease the volume of coal they purchase from us or switch to alternative fuels as a result of existing or future environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions, our financial operating results including earnings, cash flow and liquidity could be adversely impacted.", "PERMNO": 61946, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "BKH"}
