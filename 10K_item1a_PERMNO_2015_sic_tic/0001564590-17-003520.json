You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Clinical Development, Regulatory Review, Approval and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nPreclinical drug development is a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome.\nIn order to obtain FDA approval to market a new drug product we must demonstrate proof of safety and efficacy in humans. To meet these requirements, we will have to conduct \u201cadequate and well-controlled\u201d clinical trials. Before we can commence clinical trials for a product candidate, we must complete extensive preclinical testing and studies that support our planned Investigational New Drug application, or IND. We are refining the cGMP formulation and plan to perform preclinical activities for JNP-0101 upon completion of these activities. We are focusing on preclinical activities for JNP-0201 and JNP-0301, and expect an IND submission for JNP-0201 and for JNP-0301 in the first half of 2018. While we expect that our planned preclinical work will help support our expected IND submissions to the FDA, we cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of these prototype development efforts and planned preclinical studies. We also cannot predict if the FDA will accept our proposed clinical programs or if the outcome of our prototype development efforts and planned preclinical activities will ultimately support the further development of these product candidates. Thus, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit INDs in the planned time-frame if at all, and we cannot be sure that submission of the INDs will result in the FDA in allowing clinical trials to begin.\nConducting preclinical testing studies is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per product candidate. Delays associated with product candidates for which we are directly conducting preclinical testing and studies may cause us to incur additional operating expenses. Moreover, we may be affected by delays associated with the preclinical testing and studies of certain product candidates conducted by our potential partners over which we have no control. The commencement and rate of completion of preclinical studies and studies for a product candidate may be delayed by many factors, including, for example:\n\u2022\nthe inability to generate sufficient preclinical or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation of clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA not allowing us to rely on previous findings of safety and efficacy for other similar but approved products and published scientific literature.\nMoreover, even if clinical trials do begin, our development efforts may not be successful, and clinical trials that we conduct or that third parties conduct on our behalf may not demonstrate statistically sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates or product candidates employing our technology. Even if we obtain positive results from preclinical studies or initial clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future trials. The failure of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product candidate for its desired indications could harm the development of such product candidate as well as our other product candidates. Any change in, or termination of, our clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDelays in clinical trials are common for many reasons, and any such delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales as currently contemplated.\nIf our preclinical studies and activities for our product candidates are successful, we plan to conduct clinical trials of such product candidates. We may experience delays in clinical trials for our product candidates. Our planned clinical trials, including those for JNP-0101, JNP-0201 and JNP-0301, might not begin on time; may be interrupted, delayed, suspended, or terminated once commenced; might not produce results to support further development of the product candidates; might need to be redesigned; might not enroll a sufficient number of patients; or might not be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold because of safety or efficacy concerns by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board or DSMB, the FDA, or the Institutional Review Board, IRB, or us;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold by the FDA or other regulatory authorities because of significant problems with a product candidate in the same class as one of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites, particularly those in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required IRB approval at each site;\n\u2022\ndelays in identifying, recruiting, and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment due to narrow screening requirements;\n\u2022\nthe inability of patients to meet FDA or other regulatory authorities\u2019 imposed protocol requirements;\n\u2022\nthe inability to retain patients who have initiated participation in a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to various clinical or personal reasons, or who are lost to further follow-up;\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nthe inability to adequately observe patients after treatment;\n\u2022\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u2022\ntime required to add new sites;\n\u2022\nthe inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of qualified materials under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nshortages of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API;\n\u2022\nnon-compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials, including suitable API;\n\u2022\nthe need or desire to modify our manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements for clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe lack of effectiveness during the clinical trials;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues, or adverse drug reactions;\n\u2022\ndelays, suspension, or termination of the clinical trials due to the IRB responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site;\n\u2022\ninsufficient financial resources;\n\u2022\ngovernment or regulatory delays or \u201cclinical holds\u201d requiring suspension or termination of the trials; and,\n\u2022\ndelays resulting from negative or equivocal findings of DSMB for a trial.\nAny of these delays in completing our clinical trials could increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.\nFailure to recruit, enroll, and retain patients for clinical trials may cause the development of our product candidates to be delayed or development costs to increase substantially.\nWe have experienced, and expect to experience in the future, delays in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the study until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u2022\nthe size and nature of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of patients to study sites;\n\u2022\nthe design of the trial;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u2022\nthe risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion;\n\u2022\ncompetition for patients by clinical trial programs for other competitive treatments; and,\n\u2022\nclinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nOur clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition reduces the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we will conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which reduces the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. Delays in patient enrollment in the future as a result of these and other factors may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our clinical trials, which could prevent us from completing these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates.\nOur clinical trials may be halted at any time for a variety of reasons.\nOur clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time for a number of reasons. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, our collaborators, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities because of a failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, presentation of unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the investigational drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, or negative or equivocal findings of the DSMB or the IRB for a clinical trial. An IRB may also suspend or terminate our clinical trials for failure to protect patient safety or patient rights. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any proposed product that we develop, the commercial prospects of such proposed product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from any of these proposed products will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally, our current and/or future product candidates may demonstrate serious adverse side effects in clinical trials. These adverse side effects could interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials of product candidates and could result in FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of product candidates for any or all targeted indications. An IRB or independent data safety monitoring board, the FDA, other regulatory authorities, or we ourselves or our customers may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time. Product candidates may prove not to be safe for human use. In such circumstances, we may not be able to complete development and successful licensing or partnering of our own internal programs.\nOur product development efforts may not be successful.\nAll of our product candidates are in research and preclinical stages of development. We have never obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. If the results from any of our clinical trials are not positive, those results may adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval to conduct additional clinical trials or possibly raise additional capital, which will affect our ability to continue research and development activities. In addition, our product candidates may take longer than anticipated to progress through clinical trials, or patient enrollment in the clinical trials may be delayed or prolonged significantly, thus delaying the clinical trials.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will still face extensive, ongoing regulatory requirements and review, and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates in the United States, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or to the conditions for approval, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials or post-market surveillance. As a condition to granting marketing approval of a product, the FDA may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials. The results generated in these post-approval clinical trials could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, or new or increased concerns about side effects or efficacy of a product. For example, the labeling for our hormone therapy product candidates, if approved, may include restrictions on use or warnings. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (\u201cFDAAA\u201d) gives the FDA enhanced post-market authority, including the explicit authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with FDA-approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, programs. If approved, our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record keeping, and reporting of\nsafety and other post-market information. The FDA\u2019s exercise of its authority could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements, and potential restrictions on sales of approved products. Foreign regulatory agencies often have similar authority and may impose comparable measures. Post-marketing studies, whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary, and other emerging data about marketed products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect sales of our product candidates if approved, and potentially our other marketed products. Further, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of our approved products. Accordingly, new data about our products could negatively affect demand because of real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal or voluntary recall. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, and practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases or conditions to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of our products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of our products.\nThe holder of an approved New Drug Application, or NDA, also is subject to obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials. Legal requirements have also been enacted to require disclosure of clinical trial results on publicly available databases.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with the FDA\u2019s cGMPs regulations or comparable foreign requirements. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility, or us. Such restrictions may include requesting a recall or requiring withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing, requiring new warnings or other labeling changes to limit use of the drug, requiring that we conduct additional clinical trials, imposing new monitoring requirements, or requiring that we establish a REMS program. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. The distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act. Sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. If we or our third-party collaborators fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may take any of the following actions:\n\u2022\nconduct an investigation into our practices and any alleged violation of law;\n\u2022\nissue warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nrequire that we suspend or terminate any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u2022\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or request that we initiate a product recall; or,\n\u2022\nexclude us from providing our products to those participating in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing events or penalties may force us to expend significant amounts of time and money and may significantly inhibit our ability to bring to market or continue to market our products and generate revenue. Similar regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe manufacture and packaging of pharmaceutical products are subject to FDA requirements and those of similar foreign regulatory bodies. If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to satisfy these requirements, our product development and commercial efforts may be harmed.\nThe manufacture and packaging of pharmaceutical products, if approved, are regulated by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory bodies and must be conducted in accordance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP and comparable requirements of foreign regulatory bodies. Failure by us or our third-party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations or requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or voluntary recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business. The same requirements and risks are applicable to the suppliers of the key raw material used to manufacture the API for CRINONE.\nOnly one supplier of progesterone for CRINONE is approved by regulatory authorities outside the United States. To-date, we have not experienced production delays due to shortages of progesterone. Beginning in 2017, this supplier increased the price for its progesterone. It is unclear what impact, if any, an increase in the cost of progesterone will have on the demand for CRINONE. We have identified a potential second supplier of progesterone, and expect to establish a second source in 2017.\nChanges in the manufacturing process or procedure, including a change in the location where the product is manufactured or a change of a third-party manufacturer, may require prior FDA review and approval of the manufacturing process and procedures in accordance with the FDA\u2019s cGMPs. Any new facility is subject to a pre-approval inspection by the FDA and would again require us to demonstrate product comparability to the FDA. There are comparable foreign requirements. This review may be costly and time consuming and could delay or prevent the launch of a product.\nFurthermore, in order to obtain approval of our product candidates, by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, we will be required to consistently produce the API and the finished product in commercial quantities and of specified quality on a repeated basis and document our ability to do so. This requirement is referred to as process validation. Each of our potential API suppliers will likely use a different method to manufacture API, which has the potential to increase the risk to us that our manufacturers will fail to meet applicable regulatory requirements. We also need to complete process validation on the finished product in the packaging we propose for commercial sales. This includes testing of stability, measurement of impurities and testing of other product specifications by validated test methods. If the FDA does not consider the results of the process validation or required testing to be satisfactory, we may not obtain approval to launch the product or approval, launch or commercial supply after launch may be delayed.\nThe FDA and similar foreign regulatory bodies may also implement new requirements, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing requirements, for the manufacturing, packaging or testing of products at any time. If we are unable to comply, we may be subject to regulatory, civil actions or penalties which could harm our business.\nOur development, regulatory and commercialization strategy for our product candidates depends, in part, on published scientific literature and the FDA\u2019s prior findings regarding the safety and efficacy of approved products.\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, added Section 505(b)(2) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or Section 505(b)(2). Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) to permit the applicant to rely, in part, upon published literature or the FDA\u2019s previous findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product. The FDA also requires companies to perform additional clinical trials to support any difference from the previously approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the listed drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication(s) sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant as supported by additional data. The label, however, may require all or some of the limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions included in the listed drug\u2019s label, including a black box warning, or may require additional limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions.\nWe intend to design our clinical programs to advance JNP-0101, JNP-0201 and JNP-0301 for registration filing in the United States using the FDA\u2019s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and the hybrid application pathway, which is analogous to the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, in Europe. As such, our NDAs in the United States will rely, and our marketing authorization applications, or MAA, in Europe will rely, in part, on previous findings of safety and efficacy for other similar but approved products and published scientific literature. Even though we expect to be able to take advantage of Section 505(b)(2) and the hybrid application pathway to support potential regulatory approval of our product candidates in the United States and Europe, the relevant regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials to support approval over and above the clinical trials that we currently plan to commence. The relevant regulatory authorities also may determine that we have not provided sufficient data to justify reliance on prior investigations involving the approved active ingredients in our product candidates.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), in the past some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). For example, parties have filed citizen petitions objecting to the FDA approving a Section 505(b)(2) NDA on both scientific and legal and regulatory grounds. Scientific arguments have included the assertions that for the FDA to determine the similarity of the drug in the 505(b)(2) NDA to the listed drug, the agency would need to reference proprietary manufacturing information or trade secrets in the listed drug\u2019s NDA; that it would be scientifically inappropriate for the FDA to rely on public or nonpublic information about the listed drug because it differs in various ways from the drug in the 505(b)(2) NDA; or that differences between the listed drug and the drug in the 505(b)(2) NDA may impair the latter\u2019s safety and effectiveness. Legal and regulatory arguments have included the assertion that Section 505(b)(2) NDAs must contain a full report of investigations conducted on the drug proposed for approval, and that approving a drug through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway would lower the approval standards. In addition, citizen petitions have made patent-based challenges against 505(b)(2) NDAs. For example, petitioners have asserted that the FDA should refuse to file a 505(b)(2) NDA unless it references a specific NDA as the listed drug, because it is \u201cmost similar\u201d to the proposed drug, and provides appropriate patent certification to all patents listed for that NDA; or that when a 505(b)(2) NDA is pending before the agency, but before it is approved, where the FDA approves an NDA for a drug that is pharmaceutically equivalent to the drug that is the subject of the 505(b)(2) NDA, then the FDA should require that the 505(b)(2) NDA be resubmitted referencing the approved NDA as the listed drug and certifying to the listed patents for that approved drug. Such a result could require us to conduct additional testing and costly clinical trials, which could substantially delay or prevent the approval and launch of any future product candidates we may develop.\nThe commercial success of CRINONE and any current or future product candidates that are approved for marketing and sale, will depend upon gaining and retaining significant market acceptance of these products among physicians and payors, including perceptions related to pricing and access.\nPhysicians may not prescribe our products, including any current or future product candidates that are approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, which would prevent us from generating revenue or becoming profitable. Market acceptance of our products by physicians, patients, and payors, will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which our product candidates are approved, if at all;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians and payors of each product as safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including numerous generic drug products;\n\u2022\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration of our products in the treatment of the symptoms for which they are intended;\n\u2022\nthe availability and efficacy of competitive and generic drugs;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales force and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which the product is approved for inclusion on formularies of hospitals and managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other health care payors, or by government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA-approved labeling; and,\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects.\nEven if the medical community accepts that our products are safe and efficacious for their approved indications, physicians may not immediately be receptive to their use or may be slow to adopt our products as an accepted treatment for the symptoms for which they are intended. We cannot assure you that any labeling approved by the FDA will permit us to promote our products as being superior to competing products. If our products, if approved, do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians and payors, we may not generate sufficient or any revenue from these products and we may not become profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIf our product candidates, are approved for sale, and the actual number of patients in the applicable market is smaller than we estimate, our revenue could be adversely affected, possibly materially.\nThere is no patient registry or other method for establishing with precision the actual number of patients that might benefit from our product candidates. There is no guarantee that our assumptions and estimates are correct. The number of patients our product candidates could benefit, if approved for use, could actually be significantly lower than our estimates.\nWe believe that the actual size of the total addressable markets for our product candidates, if approved, will be determined only after we have substantial history as a commercial company. If the total addressable market for our products is smaller than we expect, our revenue could be adversely affected, possibly materially.\nThe longer term growth of our business depends in part on our efforts to utilize our proprietary delivery technologies to expand our portfolio of product candidates, which may require substantial financial resources and may ultimately be unsuccessful.\nThe longer term growth of our business depends in part upon our ability to utilize our proprietary delivery technologies to develop and commercialize therapeutic products. In addition to our development and commercialization of JNP-0101, JNP-0201, and JNP-0301, we intend to pursue the development and commercialization of other product candidates that leverage our IVR technology. A significant portion of the research that we are conducting involves our IVR technology.\nResearch programs to identify new disease targets or conditions and product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources whether or not we ultimately identify any additional product candidates. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including that:\n\u2022\nthe research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates; or,\n\u2022\npotential product candidates may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate they are unlikely to be effective drugs.\nIf we are able to identify additional potential product candidates, satisfaction of these regulatory requirements will entail substantial time, effort, and financial resources. We may never satisfy these requirements. The effort, and financial resources we expend on the development of additional product candidates may impair our ability to continue development, obtain regulatory approval, and commercialize our current product candidates, and we may never commence clinical trials of such development programs despite expending significant resources in pursuit of their development. If we do commence clinical trials of other product candidates, these product candidates may never demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to be approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. If any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for such program or programs, which would harm our business.\nHealthcare insurers and other payors may not pay for our products or may impose limits on reimbursement.\nThe ability of us or our partners to commercialize our prescription products will depend, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for our products is available from third-party payors, such as health maintenance organizations, health insurers and other public and private payors. If we or our partners succeed in bringing new products to market or expand the approved label for existing products, we cannot be assured that third-party payors will pay for such products, or establish and maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in product development.\nGovernment health agencies, private health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors may use one or more tools including price controls, profit or reimbursement caps, and use of formularies, or lists of drugs for which coverage is provided under a healthcare benefit plan, to control the costs of prescription drugs. Each payor that maintains a drug formulary makes its own determination as to whether a new drug will be added to the formulary and whether particular drugs in a therapeutic class will have preferred status over other drugs in the same class. This determination often involves an assessment of the clinical appropriateness of the drug and, in some cases, the cost of the drug in comparison to alternative products. Our products marketed by us or our partners from which we derive sales revenues and royalties may not be added to payors\u2019 formularies, our products may not have preferred status to alternative therapies, and formulary decisions may not be conducted in a timely manner. Once reimbursement at an agreed level is approved by a payor organization, reimbursement may be lost entirely or be reduced compared to competitive products. As reimbursement is often approved for a period of time, this risk is greater at the end of the time period, if any, for which the reimbursement was approved. Our partners may also decide to enter into discount or formulary fee arrangements with payors, which could result in lower or discounted prices for CRINONE or future products. The cost of drugs has received a lot of attention from government authorities, including the U.S. Congress, and it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or whether regulations or policies will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.\nIf our products do not have the effects intended or cause adverse events, our business may suffer.\nAlthough many of the ingredients in our current product candidates are approved generics, human hormones, and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption, they also contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients. Our product or product candidates could have certain undesirable adverse events, including if not taken as directed or if taken by a consumer who has certain medical conditions. In addition, our product and product candidates may not have the effect intended, including if they are not taken in accordance with certain instructions. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our product or product candidates, even when used as directed, will have the effects intended or will not have adverse events in an\nunforeseen way or on an unforeseen cohort. If any of our products or products we develop or commercialize in the future are shown to be harmful or generate negative publicity from adverse events, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects would be harmed significantly.\nOur products could demonstrate hormone replacement risks.\nIn the past, certain studies of female hormone replacement therapy products, such as conjugated equine estrogen, have reported an increase in health risks. Progesterone is a natural female hormone present at normal levels in most women throughout their lifetimes. However, some women require progesterone supplementation due to a natural or chemical-related progesterone deficiency. It is possible that data suggesting risks or problems may come to light in the future that could demonstrate a health risk associated with progesterone or progestin supplementation or CRINONE or our product candidates. It is also possible that future study results for hormone replacement therapy could be negative and could result in negative publicity about the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy. As a result, physicians and patients may not wish to prescribe or use progesterone or other hormones, including CRINONE.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims.\nWe could be exposed to future product liability claims by consumers. Although we presently maintain product liability insurance coverage at what we believe is a commercially reasonable level, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. An award against us in an amount greater than our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe face substantial competition from larger companies with considerable resources that already have comparable treatments available in the market, and they or others may also discover, develop or commercialize additional products before or more successfully than we do.\nOur industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Our potential competitors include primarily large pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and specialty pharmaceutical companies. In attempting to achieve the widespread commercialization of our product candidates, we will face competition from established drugs and major brand names and also generic versions of these products. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to our future products.\nOur services business competes directly with the in-house research departments of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as contract research companies, and research and academic institutions. We also experience significant competition from foreign companies operating under lower cost structures. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have. We expect to face increased competition as new companies enter the market and as more advanced technologies become available. In the future, any one of our competitors may develop technological advances that render the services that we provide obsolete. While we plan to develop technologies, which will give us competitive advantages, our competitors plan to do the same. We may not be able to develop the technologies we need to successfully compete in the future, and our competitors may be able to develop such technologies before we do or provide those services at a lower cost. Consequently, we may not be able to successfully compete in the future.\nMany of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. These companies also have long-established relationships within the medical and patient community, including patients, physicians, nurses and commercial third-party payors and government payors. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to:\n\u2022\ndiscover and develop product candidates that are superior to other products in the market;\n\u2022\nobtain required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nadequately communicate the benefits of our product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\nattract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our product candidates and any future product candidates we may develop; and,\n\u2022\nobtain collaboration arrangements to commercialize our product candidates and any future product candidates we may develop.\nMergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval of drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors\u2019 drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates or any future product candidates we may develop obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates or any future product candidates we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval of ours. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and more advanced technologies become available. For example, a competitor could develop therapies that are more efficacious or convenient than our product candidates. If we are unable to compete effectively, our opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of our product candidates or any future product candidates we may develop, if approved, could be impaired.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the health care system and other regulatory or statutory changes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may adversely impact our business, operations, or financial results.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations, or financial results. In particular, in March 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a related reconciliation bill (collectively the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) were signed into law. This legislation changes the current system of healthcare insurance and benefits and is intended to broaden coverage and control costs. The law also contains provisions that affect companies in the pharmaceutical industry and other healthcare related industries by imposing additional costs and changes to business practices. Provisions affecting pharmaceutical companies include the following:\n\u2022\nMandatory rebates for drugs sold into the Medicaid program have been increased, and the rebate requirement has been extended to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans.\n\u2022\nThe definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d was revised for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates by state.\n\u2022\nThe 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Service Act has been extended to require mandatory discounts for drug products sold to certain critical access hospitals, cancer hospitals and other covered entities.\n\u2022\nPharmaceutical companies are required to offer discounts on brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d\n\u2022\nPharmaceutical companies are required to pay an annual non-tax deductible fee to the federal government based on each company\u2019s market share of prior year total sales of branded products to certain federal healthcare programs. The aggregated industry-wide fee is expected to total $28 billion through 2019. Since we expect our branded pharmaceutical sales to constitute a small portion of the total federal healthcare program pharmaceutical market, we do not expect this annual assessment to have a material impact on our financial condition.\nDespite initiatives to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld certain key aspects of the legislation, including the requirement that all individuals maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty, referred to as the individual mandate, and a provision that provides federal premium tax credits to individuals purchasing coverage through health insurance exchanges. Additionally, there are legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act in lower courts on other grounds. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the Affordable Care Act that are repealed. Thus, the full impact of the Affordable Care Act, any law replacing elements of it, and the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement of it on our business remains unclear.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which began in 2013, which will remain in effect until 2025 unless additional congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare\nproducts and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability.\nIn addition, in September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted giving the FDA enhanced post-marketing authority including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies approved by the FDA. The FDA\u2019s exercise of this authority could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to ensure compliance with post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on the sale and/or distribution of approved products. Other legislative and regulatory initiatives have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. For example, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013 imposes new obligations on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance documents or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nFurther, in some foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and Canada, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. Our business could be harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.\nMoreover, we cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further, federal and state legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives in the United States to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from our current and future products and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur product revenue is dependent on the continued sale of CRINONE to Merck KGaA.\nOur operating results are dependent on the product revenues from Merck KGaA derived from the sale of CRINONE in countries outside the U.S. Revenues from sales to Merck KGaA during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 constituted approximately 50%, 60% and 54% of our total revenues, respectively. We do not control the amount and timing of marketing resources that Merck KGaA may or may not devote to our product. The failure of Merck KGaA to effectively market CRINONE and maintain licensure in marketed countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our current supply agreement with Merck KGaA has an expiration date of May 19, 2020.\nWe may fail to obtain new customer projects, renew existing customers or have customer project cancellations at our wholly-owned subsidiary, JPS, which may adversely affect our service revenue and gross margin.\nThe majority of our customer projects at JPS are short-term in duration. As a result, we must maintain a robust backlog of customer programs to replace projects as they are completed. In the event we are unable to replace these customer projects in a timely manner or at all, our revenues may not be able to be sustained or may decline. In addition, customer projects may be cancelled or delayed by clients for any reason upon notice and this can materially impact our business. While we intend to seek new or extended agreements, if new contracts cannot be completed or existing contracts cannot be extended on terms acceptable to us or at all, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have made significant capital investments in our JPS business to meet growth expectations. If we are unable to utilize the facilities\u2019 expected capacity, our margins could be adversely affected.\nWe have made substantial investments in our Nottingham, U.K. facilities and equipment to support increased development and contract manufacturing activity. If new customer agreements are not executed or do not generate expected revenues, we may have excess fixed costs capacity that may require an impairment charge that will negatively affect our financial performance.\nForeign governments often impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions either directly or through a future collaboration partner. If we or a potential future collaboration partner obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions, we or such collaboration partner will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our product\ncandidates. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, prescription drug pricing is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or a potential future collaboration partner may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our product candidates is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf our products are marketed or distributed in a manner that violates federal, state or foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws, marketing disclosure laws or other federal, state or foreign laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad, our general operations, and the research, development, manufacture, sale and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive additional federal, state and foreign healthcare regulation, including the FCA, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and their state analogues, and similar laws in countries outside of the U.S., laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and governing sampling and distribution of products, and government price reporting laws.\nOur activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws and private individuals have been active in bringing lawsuits on behalf of the government under the FCA and similar laws in other countries. We have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are current best practices in the pharmaceutical industry; however, these laws are broad in scope and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that definitively interpret these laws in the context of particular industry practices. We cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all federal, state and foreign regulations. If we or our representatives fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations, a range of fines, penalties and/or other sanctions could be imposed on us, including, but not limited to, restrictions on how we market and sell our products, significant fines, exclusions from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, litigation, or other sanctions. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such investigations or suits may also result in related shareholder lawsuits, which can also have an adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, the FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. For drug products that are approved by the FDA under the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval regulations, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the sponsor must submit promotional materials at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination of the promotional materials, which delays and may negatively impact our commercial team\u2019s ability to implement changes such product\u2019s marketing materials, thereby negatively impacting revenues. Moreover, under Subpart H, the FDA may also withdraw approval of such product if, among other things, the promotional materials are false or misleading, or other evidence demonstrates that such product is not shown to be safe or effective under its conditions of use.\nThe U.S. government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The government has also required companies to enter into complex corporate integrity agreements and/or non-prosecution agreements that can impose significant restrictions and other burdens on the affected companies. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to similar consequences.\nIn recent years, several U.S. states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing and promotional compliance programs or codes of conduct and/or to file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, and other activities. In addition, as part of the Affordable Care Act, manufacturers of drugs are required to publicly report gifts and other payments or transfers of value made to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals. Several states have also adopted laws that prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain healthcare providers. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and the likely extent of penalties for failure to comply with these requirements is unclear; however, compliance with these laws is difficult, time consuming and costly, and if we are found to not be in full compliance with these laws, we may face enforcement actions, fines and other penalties, and we could receive adverse publicity which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with any federal, state, or foreign laws or regulations governing our industry, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions that could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products, harm or prevent sales of our products, or substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, incentives exist under applicable U.S. law that encourage employees and physicians to report violations of rules governing promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. These incentives could lead to so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lawsuits as part of which such persons seek to collect a portion of moneys allegedly overbilled to government agencies as a result of, for example, promotion of pharmaceutical products beyond labeled claims. Such lawsuits, whether with or without merit, are typically time-consuming and costly to defend. Such suits may also result in related shareholder lawsuits, which are also costly to defend.\nOur corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations.\nAs a pharmaceutical development and services company, we are subject to a large body of legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, as a publicly traded company we are subject to significant regulations. We cannot assure you that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with all potentially applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of fines, cause the value of our common stock to decline, impede our ability to raise capital, or lead to the de-listing of our stock.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or form strategic alliances in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions or alliances.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or products, form strategic alliances, or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire businesses with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may have difficulty in developing, manufacturing, and marketing the products of a newly acquired company that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize value from expected synergies. We cannot assure that, following an acquisition, we will achieve the revenues or specific net income that justifies the acquisition.\nThe loss of our key executives could have a significant impact on us.\nOur success depends in large part upon the abilities and continued service of our executive officers and other key employees. Our employment agreements with our executive officers are terminable by either party on short notice. The loss of key employees may result in a significant loss in the knowledge and experience that we, as an organization, possess, and could cause significant delays in, or outright failure of, the management of our supply chain, our pharmaceutical development, analytical, and consulting services business and/ or, our development of future products and product candidates. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified and talented senior management personnel, our business may suffer.\nWe will need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of February 28, 2017, we had 139 employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources. Our future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate new employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from their day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of our product candidates. If we are unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to increase revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth in our organization.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions. The occurrence of any business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our ability to produce clinical supplies of JNP-0101, JNP-0201, JNP-0301 and other potential product candidates could be disrupted if the operations of JPS or our other suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption.\nOur internal computer systems, or those used by our third-party collaborators, CROs, or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party collaborators, CROs, and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. Although to our knowledge we have not experienced any such material system failure or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from current or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on our third-party collaborators and other third parties for research and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and/or suffer substantial reputational harm and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nOur operations involve hazardous materials and are subject to environmental, health, and safety controls and regulations.\nWe are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use of hazardous materials, and we spend considerable time complying with such laws and regulations. Our business activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and although we take precautions to prevent accidental contamination or injury from these materials, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of using these materials. In the event of an accident or environmental discharge, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, which may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third-parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our preclinical studies. If those parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our product candidates may not advance in a timely manner or at all.\nIn the course of our discovery, preclinical testing, and clinical trials, we rely on third parties, including universities, investigators, and CROs, to perform critical services for us. For example, we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our preclinical studies. CROs and investigators are responsible for many aspects of the trials, including finding and enrolling patients for testing and administering the trials. We therefore must rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, but their failure to comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements, or to perform their services in a timely and acceptable manner, may compromise our clinical trials in particular or our business in general. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with GCP, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial patients are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. These third parties may not be available when we need them or, if they are available, may not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or may not otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner. Any failings by these third parties may compromise our clinical trials in particular or our business in general. Similarly, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. These independent third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. For example, if such third parties fail to perform their obligations in compliance with our clinical trial protocols, our clinical trials may not meet regulatory requirements or may need to be repeated. As a result of our dependence on third parties, we may face delays or failures outside of our direct control. These risks also apply to the development activities of our collaborators, and we do not control our collaborators\u2019 research and development, clinical trials or regulatory activities.\nIn addition, from time to time we have prepaid research and development expenses to third parties that have been deferred and capitalized as pre-payments to secure the receipt of future preclinical and clinical research and development services. These pre-payments are recognized as an expense in the period that the services are performed. We assess our prepaid research and development expenses for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the prepaid expense may not be recoverable or provide a future economic benefit, including the risk of third party nonperformance. If there are indicators that the third parties are unable to perform the research and development services, we may be required to take an impairment charge.\nOur research and development activities rely on technology licensed from third parties, and termination of any of those licenses would result in loss of significant rights to develop and market our products, which would impair our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been granted rights to a technology necessary for our research and development activities from third parties through license agreements. The license generally may be terminated by the licensor if we fail to perform our obligations under the agreement, including obligations to develop the product candidates under license. If terminated, we would lose the right to develop the\nproduct candidates, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The license agreements also generally require us to meet specified milestones or show reasonable diligence in development of the technology. If disputes arise over the definition of these requirements or whether we have satisfied the requirements in a timely manner, or if any other obligations in the license agreements are disputed by the other party, the other party could terminate the agreement, and we could lose our rights to develop the licensed technology.\nIn addition, if new technology is developed from these licenses, we may be required to negotiate certain key financial and other terms, such as milestone and royalty payments, for the licensing of this future technology with the third party licensors, and it might not be possible to obtain any such license on terms that are satisfactory to us, or at all.\nWe are completely dependent on third parties to manufacture our commercial products, and we use single-source supplier for certain of our raw materials, and any difficulties, disruptions, or delays, or the need to find alternative sources, could adversely affect our profitability and future business prospects.\nWe do not currently own or operate, and currently do not plan to own or operate, facilities for the commercial manufacture of our products. We currently rely solely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture CRINONE and will rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture any product candidates that are approved for marketing and sale. We also currently have a single supplier of ethylene vinyl acetate (\u201cEVA\u201d) for development applications only. We do not currently have an alternative manufacturer for our drug substance and finished drug product, and we may not be able to enter into agreements with second source manufacturers whose facilities and procedures comply with cGMP, regulations and other regulatory requirements on a timely basis and with terms that are favorable to us, if at all.\nOur ability to have our commercial products manufactured in sufficient quantities and at acceptable costs to meet our commercial demand and clinical development needs is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our third-party contract manufacturing facilities. Any difficulties, disruptions or delays in the manufacturing process could result in product defects or shipment delays, suspension of manufacturing or sale of the product, recall or withdrawal of product previously shipped for commercial or clinical purposes, inventory write-offs or the inability to meet commercial demand in a timely and cost-effective manner. Furthermore, our current third-party manufacturers do not manufacture for us exclusively and may exhaust some or all of their resources meeting the demand of other customers. In addition, securing additional third-party contract manufacturers for our products will require significant time for transitioning the necessary manufacturing processes, gaining regulatory approval, and for having the appropriate oversight and may increase the risk of certain problems, including cost overruns, process reproducibility, stability issues, the inability to deliver required quantities of product that conform to specifications in a timely manner, or the inability to manufacture our products in accordance with cGMP.\nFurther, we and our third-party manufacturers currently purchase certain raw and other materials used to manufacture our products from third-party suppliers and, at present, do not have long-term supply contracts with most of these third parties. These third-party suppliers may cease to produce the raw or other materials used in our product or product candidates or otherwise fail to supply these materials to us or our third-party manufacturers or fail to supply sufficient quantities of these materials to us or our third-party manufacturers in a timely manner for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nunexpected demand for or shortage of raw or other materials;\n\u2022\nadverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements or action;\n\u2022\nan inability to provide timely scheduling and/or sufficient capacity;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing difficulties;\n\u2022\nchanges to the specifications of the raw materials such that they no longer meet our standards;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient quantities or profit on the production of raw materials to interest suppliers;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes or shortages; or,\n\u2022\nimport or export problems.\nAny other interruption in our third-party supply chain could adversely affect our ability to satisfy commercial demand and our clinical development needs for our products and product candidates. In addition, we or our third-party manufacturers sometimes obtain raw or other materials from one vendor only, even where multiple sources are available, to maintain quality control and enhance working relationships with suppliers, which could make us susceptible to price inflation by the sole supplier, thereby increasing our production costs. As a result of the high-quality standards imposed on our raw or other materials, we or our third-party\nmanufacturers may not be able to obtain such materials of the quality required to manufacture our products and product candidates from an alternative source on commercially reasonable terms, or in a timely manner, if at all.\nIf we are unable to have our products and product candidates manufactured on a timely or sufficient basis because of the factors discussed above, we may not be able to meet commercial demand or our clinical development needs for our products and product candidates, or may not be able to manufacture our products and product candidates in a cost-effective manner. As a result, we may lose sales, fail to generate increased revenues or suffer regulatory setbacks, any of which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and future business prospects.\nFor example, our IVR technology utilizes medical grade ethlyene vinyl acetate polymers for which there are a limited number of vendors from a single supplier. The EVA polymer used in our IVR products must meet certain manufacturing and quality specifications in order to be used in pharmaceutical applications. We are not aware of any companies, other than our existing supplier, which manufacture EVA meeting the specifications required for use in our pharmaceutical IVR application. We have purchased GMP pharmaceutical grade EVA from a single supplier for development applications but have not entered into a commercial supply agreement. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to enter into a commercial supply agreement under terms that are commercially acceptable. Even if an acceptable commercial supply agreement can be negotiated with our existing supplier, it may not be possible to identify a back-up, or second source of EVA, should they be unable to supply material, for any reason.\nIf we are unable to reach acceptable financial terms for research and commercial supplies with one of these vendors, our ability to commercialize products using the technology will be significantly delayed or prohibited.\nWe are dependent on single-source third-party suppliers of raw materials for our product, the loss of whom could impair our ability to manufacture and sell our products.\nMedical grade, cross-linked polycarbophil, the polymer used in our BDS-based product is currently available from only one supplier, Lubrizol, Inc.(\u201cLubrizol\u201d). We believe that Lubrizol will supply as much of the material as we require because our product ranks among the highest value-added uses of the polymer. In the event that Lubrizol cannot or will not supply enough of the product to satisfy our needs, we will be required to seek alternative sources of polycarbophil. An alternative source of polycarbophil may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all, which would impair our ability to manufacture and sell our product. While we purchase polycarbophil from Lubrizol from time to time, we do not have an agreement with them concerning future purchases.\nOnly one supplier of progesterone is approved by regulatory authorities outside the United States If this supplier is unable or unwilling to satisfy our needs, we will be required to seek alternative sources of supply. While alternative sources of progesterone exist, and we have identified a potential second supplier, the time needed to obtain regulatory approvals for new suppliers may impair our ability to manufacture and sell our products.\nWe are dependent upon single-source third-party manufacturers for our sale of CRINONE, the loss of which could result in a loss of revenues.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture CRINONE, including, Fleet Laboratories Limited (\u201cFleet\u201d), which manufactures CRINONE in bulk, Maropack AG (\u201cMaropack\u201d), which fills CRINONE into applicators, and Central Pharma Ltd (\u201cCentral Pharma\u201d), which packages CRINONE in final containers. These third parties may not be able to satisfy our needs in the future, and we may not be able to find or obtain approval from regulatory authorities of alternate developers and manufacturers. Delays in the manufacture of CRINONE could have a material adverse effect on our business. This reliance on third parties could have an adverse effect on our profit margins. Any interruption in the manufacture of CRINONE would impair our ability to deliver our product to customers on a timely and competitive basis, and could result in the loss of revenues.\nOnly one supplier of progesterone for CRINONE is approved by regulatory authorities outside the United States. To-date, we have not experienced production delays due to shortages of progesterone. Beginning in 2017, this supplier has increased the price for its progesterone. It is unclear what impact, if any, an increase in the cost of progesterone will have on the demand for CRINONE. We have identified a potential second supplier of progesterone, and expect to establish a second source in 2017.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the next several years and thus may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe expect to incur increasing operating losses over the next several years. Expected future operating losses will have an adverse effect on our cash resources, stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. If we obtain regulatory approval of JNP-0101, JNP-0201, JNP-0301 or any future product candidates, we may incur significant sales, marketing, and outsourced manufacturing expenses, as well as continued research and development expenses. In addition, we expect our research and development expenses to significantly increase in connection with our potential clinical trials for JNP-0101, JNP-0201 and JNP-0301, and as we explore\nadditional product candidates for our drug pipeline. We will also continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.\nWe may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable could depress the value of our stock and impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain regulatory approvals, diversify our portfolio of product candidates, or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates if we fail to obtain additional financing.\nWe need substantial amounts of cash to complete the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Although we have existing cash and cash equivalents, and future cash is expected from the ongoing results of our core operations, it may not be sufficient to fund our requirements in an expeditious manner. In addition, changing circumstances may cause us to consume funds significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. We may attempt to raise additional capital from the issuance of equity or debt securities, collaborations with third parties, licensing of rights to these products, or other means, or a combination of any of the foregoing. Securing additional financing will require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to conduct our day-to-day operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to take one or more of the following actions:\n\u2022\nsignificantly delay, scale back, or discontinue our product development and commercialization efforts;\n\u2022\nseek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be the case; and,\n\u2022\nlicense, potentially on unfavorable terms, our rights to our product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nDebt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or proposed products, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing discovery, development, and commercialization efforts, and our ability to generate revenue and achieve or sustain profitability will be substantially harmed.\nImpairment of our intangible assets could result in significant charges that would adversely impact our future operating results.\nWe have significant intangible assets, including goodwill and intangibles with useful lives ranging from three to seven years, which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions. The most significant intangible assets we have is goodwill as well as developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names. We amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line or accelerated method, based on the useful life of the asset over which it is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill on an annual basis. Goodwill and intangible assets are assessed whenever triggering events or certain changes in circumstances have occurred. Factors that could trigger an impairment of such assets include the following:\n\u2022\nsignificant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;\n\u2022\nsignificant negative industry or economic trends;\n\u2022\nsignificant decline in our stock price for a sustained period;\n\u2022\nchanges in our organization or management reporting structure that could result in additional reporting units, which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation in our analysis by reporting unit; and\n\u2022\na decline in our market capitalization below net book value.\nFuture adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would impact our results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified.\nWe are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates.\nWith four international subsidiaries and third party manufacturers in the European Union, economic and political developments in the European Union can have a significant impact on our business. All of our products are currently manufactured in the European Union. We are exposed to currency fluctuations related to payment for the manufacture of our products in Euros, Pounds Sterling, Swiss Francs, and other currencies and selling them in U.S. dollars and other currencies.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to penetrate foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\nOur future profitability may depend, in part, on our ability to gain approval of, and commercialize, our product candidates in foreign markets for which we may rely on collaboration with third parties. If we are able to gain approval for, and commercialize our product candidates in foreign markets, we would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nthe amount of reimbursement for our product candidates in foreign markets, and the nature of any limitations and caps on such reimbursement;\n\u2022\nour inability to directly control commercial activities to the extent we are relying on third parties;\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferent medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;\n\u2022\nimport or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection times;\n\u2022\nlonger lead times for shipping;\n\u2022\nlanguage barriers for technical training;\n\u2022\nreduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe existence of additional potentially relevant third party intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022\nthe interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute.\nForeign sales of our product candidates could also be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs.\nThe patent protection for our CRINONE product has expired, and our competitors may develop and commercialize generic or otherwise competitive products, the sales of which may materially affect the revenue we receive based on the sale of our CRINONE product around the world.\nAlthough our CRINONE product is the primary source of our commercial revenue, the patents covering CRINONE have expired in all the major jurisdictions where CRINONE is currently being sold. As a result, we may face significant competition in those markets. Our competitors may develop and commercialize products that compete with CRINONE, and the sales of such products may materially affect the revenue we receive from Merck KGaA, based on sales of CRINONE outside the United States.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection for our product candidates, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to commercialize our product candidates\nsuccessfully may be adversely affected; also the term of our or our licensor\u2019s issued patents may be inadequate to protect our competitive position for our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nThe success of our JNP-0101, JNP-0201, and JNP-0301 product candidates depends, in part, upon our and our licensors ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries for our product candidates. If we do not receive adequate intellectual property protection, our competitors may be able to erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. To protect our proprietary position, we or our licensors have filed and, when appropriate, will file patent applications in the United States and abroad to seek protection for innovations relating to our novel product candidates that are important to our business. The patent application and approval process, however, is expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain. In addition, the determination of patent rights with respect to pharmaceutical products commonly involves complex legal and factual questions, which has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.\nPending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Assuming that the other requirements for patentability are met, currently, the first to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. However, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nMoreover, because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, our patents or pending patent applications may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. For example, we may be subject to a third party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or become involved in post-grant review procedures, oppositions, derivations, reexaminations, inter partes review or interference proceedings, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our or our licensor\u2019s patent rights. An adverse determination in any such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products.\nOur pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection and prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. For example, our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing alternative formulations that have biological activities the same as or similar to our product candidates but fall outside the scope of the claims of our issued patents. Also, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our competitors may be able to commercialize products that compete with our product candidates, which may have a material adverse effect on our business position, business prospects, and financial condition.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke those parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, in addition to counterclaims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, or both. In any patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the invention. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against\nthose parties or other competitors, and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition.\nEven if we prevail in our infringement action, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on our and our strategic partner\u2019s ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and to sell CRINONE without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. If any third-party patents or patent applications are found to cover our product candidates or their methods of use, we may not be free to manufacture or market our product candidates as planned without obtaining a license, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. For example, we are aware of a United States method of use patent owned by Allergan that would apply to JNP-0301, which may require us to obtain a license in order to commercialize JNP-0301.\nThere is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the pharmaceutical industry, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates, including interference proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. The pharmaceutical industry has produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we were sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could significantly harm our business and operating results. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third party in order to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\nWhile we have obtained composition of matter patents with respect to some of our product candidates, we also rely on trade secret protection for certain aspects of our technology platform, including certain aspects of our formulation and device development expertise and know-how. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, consultants, independent contractors, advisors, contract manufacturers, suppliers and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with employees and certain consultants. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Furthermore, even if the information were to become available to the public\nby improper means, once released, we will not be able to stop other innocent parties from using the released information. In addition, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such third party, or those to whom they communicate such technology or information, from using that technology or information to compete with us or from disclosing the information widely. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly in developing countries. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we may obtain patent protection, but where patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents or where any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing with us.\nMoreover, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws. Additionally, laws of some countries outside of the United States and Europe do not afford intellectual property protection to the same extent as the laws of the United States and Europe. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, including India, China and other developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, certain foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties under certain circumstances. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in certain countries outside the United States and Europe. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, if our ability to enforce our patents to stop infringing activities is inadequate. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and resources from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in major markets for our products, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our products. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nSome of our employees, including members of our senior management, were previously employed at other pharmaceutical companies, and some of these employees, including members of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from that third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, which may result in claims by or against us related to the ownership of such intellectual property. Even if we enter into such agreements, we cannot prevent the other party from, for example, attempting to challenge the ownership or inventorship of the proprietary rights that was intended to be covered by the agreement. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our senior management and scientific personnel.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market prices and volume of securities of small specialty pharmaceutical companies, including ours, from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range. Between 2014 and 2016, our common stock traded in a range from $4.30 to $15.44 per share. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, our common stock traded in a range from $4.30 to $10.21 per share. It is likely that the price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. In particular, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including: the results of our operations, our ability to develop additional products and services, and general market conditions. In addition, the occurrence of any of the risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d could have a material and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nSales of large amounts of our common stock may adversely affect our market price. The issuance of preferred stock or convertible debt may adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 10,843,752 shares of common stock outstanding, of which 10,430,777 shares were freely tradable. As of that date, approximately 412,975 shares of our common stock were held by affiliates. We also have the following securities outstanding: series B convertible preferred stock, contingently redeemable series C convertible preferred stock, treasury shares, and options. If all of these securities are exercised or converted, an additional 1.6 million shares of our common stock will be outstanding, all of which will be available for resale under the Securities Act, subject in some cases to applicable volume limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. The exercise and conversion of these securities would likely dilute the book value per share of our common stock. In addition, the existence of these securities may adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional equity financing.\nIn March 2002, our Board of Directors authorized shares of series D junior participating preferred stock in connection with its adoption of a stockholder rights plan which plan was amended and restated on November 29, 2010 and subsequently on January 28, 2015, under which we issued rights to purchase series D convertible preferred stock to holders of our common stock. Upon certain triggering events, such rights become exercisable to purchase shares of our common stock (or, in the discretion of our Board of Directors, series D convertible preferred stock) at a price substantially discounted from the then current market price of our common stock.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1.0 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. In addition, we may issue convertible debt without shareholder approval. The rights of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock or convertible debt that may be issued in the future. While we have no present intention to authorize or issue any additional series of preferred stock or convertible debt, such preferred stock or convertible debt, if authorized and issued, may have other rights, including economic rights senior to our common stock, and, as a result, their issuance could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could impede or discourage a third-party acquisition of the Company. This could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium over market price for their stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation. Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various obstacles to the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our Board of Directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan (as discussed above, this plan was amended and restated on November 29, 2010 and subsequently on January 28, 2015) and has designated a series of preferred stock that could be used defensively if a takeover is threatened. Our incorporation under Delaware law, our stockholder rights plan, our ability to issue additional series of preferred stock, among other things, could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving our company or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock. This could reduce the market value of our common stock if investors view these factors as preventing stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares.\nIf equity research analysts stop publishing research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our common stock or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nWe may be limited in our use of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had certain net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $156.2 million that may be used to reduce our future U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if we become profitable on a federal income tax basis. If unused, these tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire between 2020 and 2035. Our ability to use these loss carryforwards to reduce our future U.S. federal income tax liabilities could also be lost if we were to experience more than a 50% change in ownership within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the \u201cCode\u201d). If we were to lose the benefits of these loss carryforwards, our future earnings and cash resources would be materially and adversely affected.\nOn January 22, 2015, our Board of Directors adopted an amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of November 29, 2010, (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d), between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as successor rights agent as (amended and restated, the \u201cAmended Rights Plan\u201d). We adopted the Rights Plan to preserve the value of our net operating loss carry forwards by reducing the likelihood that we would experience an ownership change by discouraging any person (together with such person\u2019s affiliates and associates), without the approval of the Board of Directors, (i) from acquiring 4.99% or more of the outstanding Voting Stock (as defined in the Rights Plan) and (ii) that currently beneficially owns 4.99% or more of the outstanding Voting Stock from acquiring more shares of Voting Stock, other than by exercise or conversion of currently existing warrants, convertible securities or other equity-linked securities. In general, the Amended Rights Plan leaves the Rights Plan unchanged in all material respects, other than increasing from 4.99% or more to 9.99% or more the percentage of outstanding shares of Voting Stock that a Person must Beneficially Own (as defined in the Amended Rights Plan) in order to qualify as an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d for purposes of triggering the Rights (as defined in the Amended Rights Plan) under the Amended Rights Plan. The Amended Rights Plan expired on July 3, 2016.\nThere is no guarantee that the Rights Plan will prevent an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, no guarantee that the value of our net operating loss carryforwards will be preserved.\nOur management has identified material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. We may be unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate controls in future periods. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and SEC rules require that our management report annually on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures. Among other things, our management must conduct an assessment of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit, the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this report, our management, with the participation of our current President and Chief Executive Officer and our current Chief Financial Officer, has determined that we have material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 related to technical accounting review of significant contractual agreements and our monitoring of expenses incurred under our clinical research agreements. The material weaknesses resulted in material misstatements in our previously filed annual audited and interim unaudited consolidated financial statements.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting before. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, relating to our evaluation of revenue recognition for services transactions and contractual arrangements. We developed a remediation plan designed to address the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Our plan included additional staffing, enhancing policies and procedures relating to revenue recognition and other areas reflected in the material weakness, and implementing a series of incremental software solutions.\nA \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We are actively engaged in developing and implementing a remediation plan designed to address such material weaknesses. However, additional material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting may be identified in the future. Any failure to implement or maintain required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, or could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. These misstatements could result in a further restatement of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, reduce our ability to obtain financing or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nAlthough we are working to remedy the material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully developed, when it will be fully implemented or the aggregate cost of implementation. Until our remediation plan is fully implemented, our management will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely fashion, or at all, or if our remediation plan is inadequate, there will continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the SEC and that our future consolidated financial statements could contain errors that will be undetected. Further and continued determinations that there are material weaknesses in the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain and require additional expenditures of both money and our management\u2019s time to comply with applicable requirements. For more information relating to the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting (and disclosure controls and procedures) and the remediation plan undertaken by us, see Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d\nWe cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to implement and document new and more precise monitoring controls or to implement organizational changes including skillset enhancements through resource changes or education to improve detection and communication of financial misstatements across all levels of the organization could result in additional material weaknesses, result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings, if any, for the development, operation, and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return to holders of our common stock would therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.", "PERMNO": 12149, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "JNP"}
