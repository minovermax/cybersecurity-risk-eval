{"cik": "891482", "company": "FULL HOUSE RESORTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business. We have described below what we currently believe to be the material risks and uncertainties in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe also face other risks and uncertainties beyond what is described below. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of securities, including our common stock, could decline significantly. You could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur present indebtedness, projected future borrowings, possible fluctuating interest rates, and required repayment schedule could adversely affect our financial health; future cash flows may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations when due, and we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing or refinancing.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had indebtedness of $68 million, including $48 million of variable interest first lien debt and $20 million of second lien debt with an interest rate that can range from 13.25% to 15.25%. Our first lien debt matures in April 2017, and includes monthly interest payments plus quarterly principal payments of $1.5 million. Our second lien debt also matures in April 2017 and includes monthly interest payments.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in refinancing our debt or that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or through asset sales to meet our long-term debt service obligations. Our present indebtedness and projected future borrowings could have important adverse consequences to us, such as:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing without restructuring the covenants in our existing indebtedness to permit the incurrence of such financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be used for payments on the debt and related interest, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund other working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to respond to changing business, industry and economic conditions and to withstand competitive pressures, which may affect our financial condition;\n\u2022\ncausing us to incur higher interest expense, either in the event of increases in interest rates on our borrowings that have variable interest rates, or in the event of refinancing existing debt at higher interest rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to make investments, dispose of assets, pay cash dividends or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or the general economy and restricting us from making improvements or acquisitions or exploring business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with less debt or greater resources; and\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default.\nIf we fail to refinance our debt or extend our current loan maturities at least one year prior to their maturities, it becomes a current liability. Having a large current liability may cause our auditors to express substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that our anticipated growth in operations will be realized, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, to complete our pending acquisition of Bronco Billy's, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, as we undertake substantial new developments or facility renovations or if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements and our debt service requirements may increase significantly.\nWe may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on either attractive terms or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nCertain borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest, and to the extent not protected with interest rate hedges, could expose us to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable-rate indebtedness could increase significantly even though the amount borrowed would remain the same.\nThe pending acquisition of Bronco Billy's remains subject to closing risks and integration risks should it be completed.\nThe pending acquisition pursuant to which the Company will acquire Bronco Billy's may not be completed for a variety of reasons, and could result in the loss of our $2.5 million purchase deposit. Such reasons include, but are not limited to: the ability to refinance our debt or raise additional funds with terms that are commercially reasonable; conditions to the closing of the transaction may not be satisfied; the occurrence of an event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the agreement; other risks to the consummation of the transaction, including the risk that the transaction will not receive necessary approvals from the remaining gaming regulatory authorities either within the permitted time period or at all; and the transaction may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays.\nIf we do consummate the transaction, we will face certain challenges as we integrate Bronco Billy\u2019s operational and administrative systems into our business. As a result, the realization of anticipated benefits may be delayed or substantially reduced. Events outside of our control, including changes in state and federal regulations and laws as well as economic trends, also could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition.\nOur indebtedness imposes restrictive covenants on us.\nOur credit facilities impose various customary covenants on us and our subsidiaries. The restrictions that are imposed under these debt obligations include, among other obligations, limitations on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake payments on subordinated obligations;\n\u2022\nmake dividends or distributions and repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ngrant liens on our property to secure debt;\n\u2022\nsell assets or enter into mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022\nsell equity interest in our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\namend or modify our subordinate indebtedness without obtaining consent from the holders of our senior indebtedness.\nOur credit facilities impose various customary affirmative covenants on us and our restricted subsidiaries, including, among others, reporting covenants, covenants to maintain insurance, compliance with laws, maintenance of properties and other covenants customary in financings of this type. In addition, our credit facilities require that we comply with various restrictive maintenance financial covenants, including a maximum total leverage ratio and maximum first lien leverage ratio (a ratio of debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our credit facilities), and a fixed charge coverage ratio.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants governing our indebtedness may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control, including delay in the completion of new projects under construction. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these covenants. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness, including failure to comply as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nIf there were an event of default under one of our credit facilities, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods. This could trigger cross-defaults under our other debt obligations. There can be no assurance that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding credit facilities if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on any of those debt instruments.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nThere can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as such indebtedness matures, and to fund our other liquidity needs. In such circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity, and cannot provide assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners. These financing strategies may not be completed on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, certain states\u2019 laws to undertake certain financing transactions require approval of gaming regulatory authorities. Some requirements may prevent or delay us from obtaining necessary capital.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms may be limited.\nAlthough we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and working capital, as well as future cash from operations and availability under the revolving term loan, will provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, we may need to seek additional financing to compete effectively. If we are unable to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms, it could:\n\u2022\nreduce funds available to us for purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to capitalize on business opportunities;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to economic downturns and competitive pressures in the markets in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe may face reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn.\nOur net revenues are highly dependent upon the volume and spending levels of customers at our properties and, as such, our business has been adversely impacted by economic downturns. Decreases in discretionary consumer spending brought about by weakened general economic conditions such as, but not limited to, lackluster recoveries from recessions, high unemployment levels, higher income taxes, low levels of consumer confidence, weakness in the housing market, cultural and demographic changes, and increased stock market volatility may negatively impact our revenues and operating cash flow.\nWe face significant competition from other gaming and entertainment operations.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including riverboat casinos, dockside casinos, land-based casinos, racetrack casinos, video lottery, poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming, social gaming and other forms of gaming. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, and other internet wagering gaming services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings, could divert customers from our properties and thus adversely affect our business. Such internet wagering services are often illegal under federal law but operate from overseas locations and are nevertheless sometimes accessible to domestic gamblers. Currently, there are proposals that would legalize internet poker and other varieties of internet gaming in a number of states and at the federal level. Several states, including Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware have enacted legislation authorizing intrastate internet gaming and internet gaming operations have begun in these states. Expansion of internet gaming in other jurisdictions (both legal and illegal) could further compete with our traditional operations, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts, and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S., in several Canadian provinces and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions that border our operational locations, such as Ohio, have recently legalized and implemented gaming. In addition, established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations. New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons could increase\ncompetition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us. Gaming competition is intense in most of the markets where we operate. As competing properties and new markets are opened, our operating results may be negatively impacted. In addition, some of our direct competitors in certain markets may have superior facilities and/or operating conditions. We expect each existing or future market in which we participate to be highly competitive. The competitive position of each of our casino properties is discussed in \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition\u201d.\nWe face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities.\nLicensing. The ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Government Regulation.\u201d\nTaxation and fees. We believe that the prospect of significant revenue is one of the primary reasons that jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, local and provincial income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes, and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.\nCompliance with other laws. We are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, employment, construction and land-use laws, and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages. If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and other regulations.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to businesses generally. The Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) of the U.S. Treasury Department, requires us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the guest by name and social security number, to the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 that we know, suspect or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. Periodic audits by the IRS and our internal audit department assess compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation. In recent years, the U.S. Treasury Department has increased its focus on Bank Secrecy Act compliance throughout the gaming industry. Recent public comments by FinCEN suggest that casinos should obtain information on each customer\u2019s sources of income. This could impact our ability to attract and retain casino guests.\nOur riverboat at Rising Star must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations with respect to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel and safety. In addition, we are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify our casino riverboat for safety, stability and single compartment flooding integrity. All of our casinos also must meet local fire safety standards. We would incur additional costs, if any, if our gaming facilities were not in compliance with one or more of these regulations.\nWe are also subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising.\nWe also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violations of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted.\nThe imposition of a substantial penalty could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking.\nLegislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in jurisdictions in which we operate. The gaming areas of our properties are not currently subject to tobacco restrictions. While gaming areas have generally been exempted from these restrictions, if additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in jurisdictions in which we operate, we could experience a significant decrease in gaming revenue and particularly, if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenues and operating income from our properties located in Mississippi, Indiana and Nevada, and are especially subject to certain risks, including economic and competitive risks, associated with the conditions in those areas and in the states from which we draw patrons.\nBecause we derive a significant amount of revenues and operating income from properties concentrated in three states, we are subject to greater risks from regional conditions than a gaming company with operating properties in several different geographies. A decrease in revenues from or increase in costs for one of these locations is likely to have a proportionally greater impact on our business and operations than it would for a gaming company with more geographically diverse operating properties. Risks from regional conditions include the following:\n\u2022\nregional economic conditions;\n\u2022\nregional competitive conditions, including legalization or expansion of gaming in Mississippi, Indiana, Nevada, or in neighboring states;\n\u2022\nallowance of new types of gaming, such as the introduction of live table games at Indiana racinos;\n\u2022\nreduced land and air travel due to increasing fuel costs or transportation disruptions; and,\n\u2022\nincrease in our vulnerability to economic downturns and competitive pressures in the markets in which we operate.\nSome of our casinos are located on leased property. If lessor buyout rights are exercised or if we default on one or more leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino.\nWe lease certain parcels of land at our Silver Slipper Casino & Hotel in Mississippi, and one of the two hotels at our Rising Star Casino Resort in Indiana. We also lease casino space at our Grand Lodge Casino in Nevada. As a lessee, we have the right to use the leased land, hotel or space as applicable; however, we do not hold fee ownership. Accordingly, unless we have a purchase option and exercise such option, we will have no interest in the improvements thereon at the expiration of the leases. The operating lease at the Grand Lodge Casino includes certain lessor buyout rights based upon a multiple of EBITDA that, if exercised, could result in the lessor purchasing our leasehold interest and the operating assets on terms that are less than fair market value or that are financially unfavorable to us. Since we do not completely control the land, hotel and space underlying our leased properties, a lessor could take certain actions to disrupt our rights under the long-term leases which are beyond our control. If the entity owning any leased land, hotel or space chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time, then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected. If we were to default on the lease, the lessor could terminate the affected lease and we could lose possession of the affected land, hotel or space and any improvements thereon. The loss of the lease through exercise of buyout rights or through termination upon default would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities, which, in turn, may result in a default under our credit facilities.\nWe are engaged from time to time in one or more construction and development projects, and many factors could prevent us from completing them as planned.\nConstruction of major buildings has certain inherent risks, including the risks of fire, structural collapse, human error and electrical, mechanical and plumbing malfunction. In addition, projects entail additional risks related to structural heights and the required use of cranes. Our development and expansion projects also entail significant risks, including:\n\u2022\nshortage of materials;\n\u2022\nshortage of skilled labor or work stoppages;\n\u2022\nunforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, excavation, environmental or geological problems;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, hurricanes, weather interference, changes in river levels, floods, fires, earthquakes or other casualty losses or delays;\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost increase or delays in completing the project;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining or inability to obtain or maintain necessary license or permits;\n\u2022\nchanges to plans or specifications;\n\u2022\nperformance by contractors and subcontractors;\n\u2022\ndisputes with contractors;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our operations caused by diversion of management\u2019s attention to new development projects and construction at our existing properties;\n\u2022\nremediation of environmental contamination at some of our proposed construction sites, which may prove more difficult or expensive than anticipated in our construction budgets;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain and maintain necessary gaming regulatory approvals and licenses, or failure to obtain such approvals and licenses on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nrequirements or government-established \u201cgoals\u201d concerning union labor or requiring that a portion of the project expenditures be through companies controlled by specific ethnic or gender groups, goals that may not be obtainable, or may only be obtainable at additional project cost; and\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of raw materials for construction, driven by demand, higher labor and construction costs and other factors, may cause price increases beyond those anticipated in the budgets for our development projects.\nEscalating construction costs may cause us to modify the design and scope of projects from those initially contemplated or cause the budgets for those projects to be increased. We generally carry insurance to cover certain liabilities related to construction, but not all risks are covered, and it is uncertain whether such insurance will provide sufficient payment in a timely fashion even for those risks that are insured and material to us.\nConstruction of our development projects exposes us to risks of cost overruns due to typical construction uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts of such projects. For these and other reasons, construction costs may exceed the estimated cost of completion, notwithstanding the existence of any guaranteed maximum price construction contracts.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be successful in the \"request for proposal\" process, which is a competitive bidding process that involves unique risks.\nOn August 10, 2015, we responded to a \"Request for Proposal\" (RFP) by the Indianapolis Airport Authority with a proposal for a $650 million lifestyle complex, anchored by a modest-size casino, known as \"American Place\". The RFP process typically involves intense competition and presents a number of risks that may not typically be present, including the need to devote substantial time and attention of management and key employees to the preparation of a proposal that may not be accepted. In addition, the RFP may attract competitors with more experience in developing large commercial projects or that are better capitalized or possess other advantages that may be compelling to the Indianapolis Airport Authority. The Indianapolis Airport Authority invited oral presentations from the different applicants in September 2015. The Indianapolis Airport Authority may select a proposal other than the proposal submitted by us or no proposal at all. We are aware of at least one other proposal which includes a sports medical complex and a 20,000-seat sports stadium. In March 2016, the Airport Authority indicated that it was canceling the RFP process, but intends to continue to seek development of the site in a manner that would be beneficial to Indianapolis and the state of Indiana. Even if selected, we may not be able to obtain the financing, partners or regulatory and legislative approvals necessary for this proposed project. There can be no assurances regarding our business prospects with respect to this opportunity. There is no certainty that our proposal will be selected or that the proposed project will become a reality.\nThe casino, hotel and resort industry is capital intensive and we may not be able to finance expansion and renovation projects, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements to remain competitive, including replacement, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. We may also need to make capital expenditures at our casino properties to comply with our debt covenants and applicable laws and regulations.\nRenovations and other capital improvements at our properties require significant capital expenditures. In addition, renovations and capital improvements usually generate little or no cash flow until the projects are completed. We may not be able to fund such projects solely from cash provided from operating activities. Consequently, we may have to rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund renovations and capital improvements, and our ability to carry them out will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing, which will depend on, among other things, market conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms. Our failure to renovate our properties may put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nAdverse weather conditions, road construction, gasoline shortages and other factors affecting our facilities and the areas in which we operate could make it more difficult for potential customers to travel to our properties and deter customers from visiting our properties.\nOur continued success depends upon our ability to draw customers from each of the geographic markets in which we operate. Adverse weather conditions or road construction can deter our customers from traveling to our facilities or make it difficult for them to frequent our properties. In 2014, there were severe cold temperatures that we believe adversely affected our Indiana and Mississippi properties\u2019 financial performance. Additionally, we believe historically low snow levels in early 2015 in the Lake Tahoe region adversely affected visitation and financial performance at the Grand Lodge Casino. Moreover, gasoline shortages or fuel price increases in regions that constitute a significant source of customers for our properties could make it more difficult for potential customers to travel to our properties and deter customers from visiting. Our dockside gaming facility in Indiana, as well as any additional riverboat or dockside casino properties that might be developed or acquired, are also subject to risks, in addition to those associated with land-based casinos, which could disrupt our operations. Although our Indiana vessel does not leave its moorings in normal operations, there are risks associated with the movement or mooring of vessels on waterways, including risks of casualty due to river turbulence, flooding, collisions with other vessels and severe weather conditions.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, or other catastrophic events, including war and terrorism.\nNatural disasters, such as major hurricanes, tornados, typhoons, floods, fires and earthquakes, could adversely affect our business and operating results. Hurricanes are common in the areas in which our Mississippi property is located and the severity of such natural disasters is unpredictable. In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused significant damage in the Gulf Coast region and damaged a casino that previously existed at our Mississippi site. Additionally, our Indiana property is at risk of flooding due to its proximity to the Ohio River.\nCatastrophic events, such as terrorist and war activities in the United States and elsewhere, have had a negative effect on travel and leisure expenditures, including lodging, gaming and tourism. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which such events may affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. There also can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or choose to purchase any insurance coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist acts and any losses that could result from these acts. If there is a prolonged disruption at our properties due to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur property and other losses that are not adequately covered by insurance, including adequate levels of Weather Catastrophe Occurrence/Named Windstorm, Flood and Earthquake insurance coverage for our properties.\nAlthough we maintain insurance that our management believes is customary and appropriate for our business, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available at reasonable costs in any given year or adequate to cover all losses and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. The lack of adequate insurance for certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are uninsured or under-insured. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to find replacements or repairs for destroyed property, and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations.\nBecause of significant loss experience caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters over the last several years, a number of insurance companies have stopped writing insurance in Class 1 hurricane areas, including Mississippi. Others have significantly limited the amount of coverage they will write in these markets and increased the premiums charged for this coverage. In addition, as a result of the worldwide economic conditions, there has been uncertainty as to the viability of certain insurance companies. While we believe that the insurance companies from which we have purchased insurance policies will remain solvent, there is no certainty that this will be the case.\nWe may face disruption and other difficulties in integrating and managing facilities we have recently developed or acquired, or may develop or acquire in the future.\nWe expect to continue pursuing expansion opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for acquisition and development of new properties, which evaluations may include discussions and the review of confidential information after the execution of nondisclosure agreements with potential acquisition candidates, some of which may be potentially significant in relation to our size.\nWe could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our expanded or combined operations and any other properties we may develop or acquire, particularly in new competitive markets. The integration of properties we may develop or acquire will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business. The process of integrating properties that we may acquire also could interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the development of new properties may involve construction, local opposition, regulatory, legal and competitive risks, as well as the risks attendant to partnership deals on these development opportunities. In particular, in projects where we team up with a joint venture partner, if we cannot reach agreement with such partners, or our relationships otherwise deteriorate, we could face significant increased costs and delays. Local opposition can delay or increase the anticipated cost of a project. Finally, given the competitive nature of these types of limited license opportunities, litigation is possible.\nManagement of new properties, especially in new geographic areas, may require that we increase our management resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. We also cannot assure you that if acquisitions are completed, that the acquired businesses will generate returns consistent with our expectations.\nOur ability to achieve our objectives in connection with any acquisition we may consummate may be highly dependent on, among other things, our ability to retain the senior level property management teams of such acquisition candidates. If, for any reason, we are unable to retain these management teams following such acquisitions or if we fail to attract new capable executives, our operations after consummation of such acquisitions could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we make new acquisitions or new investments, we may face additional risks related to our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, ability to satisfy financial covenants and comply with other restrictive covenants under our debt agreements, and ability to pay or refinance our credit facilities and other indebtedness.\nThe occurrence of some or all of the above described events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face risks related to our ability to receive regulatory approvals required to complete certain acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, and other developments, as well as other potential delays in completing certain transactions.\nOur growth may be fueled, in part, by the acquisition of existing gaming and development properties. In addition to standard closing conditions, our material transactions, including but not limited to acquisitions, are often conditioned on the receipt of regulatory approvals and other hurdles that create uncertainty and could increase costs. Such delays could significantly reduce the benefits to us of such transactions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a number of challenges prior to opening new or upgraded facilities.\nNo assurance can be given that, when we endeavor to open new or upgraded facilities, the expected timetables for opening such facilities will be met in light of the uncertainties inherent in the development of the regulatory framework, construction, the licensing process, legislative action and litigation. Delays in opening new or upgraded facilities could lead to increased costs and delays in receiving anticipated revenues with respect to such facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInsufficient or lower-than-expected results generated from our new developments and acquired properties may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance that the revenues generated from our new developments and acquired properties will be sufficient to pay related expenses if and when these developments are completed; or, even if revenues are sufficient to pay expenses, that the new developments and acquired properties will yield an adequate return or any return on our significant investments. Our projects, if completed, may take significantly longer than we expect to generate returns, if any. Moreover, lower-than-expected results from the opening of a new facility may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition and may make it more difficult to raise capital.\nRising operating costs at our gaming properties could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe operating expenses associated with our gaming properties could increase due to, among other reasons, the following factors:\n\u2022\nchanges in federal, state or local tax or regulations, including state gaming regulations or gaming taxes, could impose additional restrictions or increase our operating costs;\n\u2022\naggressive marketing and promotional campaigns by our competitors for an extended period of time could force us to increase our expenditures for marketing and promotional campaigns in order to maintain our existing customer base or attract new customers;\n\u2022\nas our properties age, we may need to increase our expenditures for repairs, maintenance, and to replace equipment necessary to operate our business in amounts greater than what we have spent historically;\n\u2022\nan increase in the cost of health care benefits for our employees could have a negative impact on our financial results;\n\u2022\nour reliance on slot play revenues and any additional costs imposed on us from vendors;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of the many products and service we provide our customers, including food, beverages, retail items, entertainment, hotel rooms, spa and golf services;\n\u2022\navailability and costs associated with insurance;\n\u2022\nincrease in costs of labor;\n\u2022\nour properties use significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy, and energy price increases may adversely affect our cost structure; and\n\u2022\nour properties use significant amounts of water, and a water shortage may adversely affect our operations.\nIf our operating expenses increase without any offsetting increase in our revenues, our results of operations would suffer.\nWe may experience an impairment of our goodwill, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have recognized a substantial amount of goodwill in connection with the purchase of our owned properties. We test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing fair value estimates for goodwill since the results are based on estimated future cash flows and assumptions related thereto. Significant assumptions include estimates of future sales and expense trends, liquidity and capitalization, among other factors. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information, which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from those projections. Further, we may need to recognize an impairment of some or all of the goodwill recognized. While such impairment charges do not immediately affect cash flows from operations, they could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power. Our security systems and all of our slot machines are controlled by computers and are reliant on electrical power to operate.\nAny unscheduled disruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our gaming operations. Such interruptions may occur as a result of, for example, a failure of our information technology or related systems, catastrophic events or rolling blackouts. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk, including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit our customers\u2019 personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information. We have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers\u2019 confidential personal information and have implemented systems designed to meet all requirements of the Payment Card Industry standards for data protection. However, our information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions. To date, none of these matters have had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent property. To date, none of these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future.\nThe concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us.\nA majority of our revenues are attributable to slot machines and related systems operated by us at our gaming facilities. It is important, for competitive reasons, that we offer popular and up-to-date slot machine games to our customers.\nA substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years were manufactured by only a few companies, and there has been recent consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector.\nIn recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participation lease arrangements. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically often require the payment of a fixed daily rental or a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participation lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.\nFor competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than our current costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participation lease costs, it could hurt our profitability.\nWe depend on our key personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of our executive management team and other members of our senior management team. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel is affected by the competitiveness of our compensation packages and the other terms and conditions of employment, our continued ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies, and our growth prospects. The loss of the services of any members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.\nFrom time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes. Some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage. As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses.\nSubsequent phases to certain of our existing projects and potential enhancements at our properties may require us to raise additional capital.\nWe may need to access the capital markets or otherwise obtain additional funds to complete subsequent phases of our existing projects and to fund potential enhancements we may undertake at our facilities there. We do not know when or if the capital markets will permit us to raise additional funds for such phases and enhancements in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Inability to access the capital markets, or the availability of capital only on less-than-favorable terms, may force us to delay, reduce or cancel our subsequent phases and enhancement projects.\nOur ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets for future offerings may also be limited by our financial condition, results of operations or other factors, such as our credit rating or outlook at the time of any such financing or offering and the covenants in our existing debt agreements, as well as by general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. As we seek additional financing, we will be subject to the risks of rising interest rates and other factors affecting the financial markets.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile, and you may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all.\nMany factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nchange in market valuations of companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nchange in expectations of future financial performance;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes;\n\u2022fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022issuance of common stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022the addition or departure of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments, dispositions, joint ventures or other significant business decisions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to companies\u2019 operating performance. Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholder derivative lawsuits and/or securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.", "PERMNO": 79490, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "FLL"}
