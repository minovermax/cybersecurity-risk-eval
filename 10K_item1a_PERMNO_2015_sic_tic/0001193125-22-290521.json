{"cik": "794172", "company": "MERIDIAN BIOSCIENCE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-11-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and/or future results. Any one of these factors could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\n\u2022\nIf the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement does not occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\n\u2022\nOur financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by outbreaks of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022\nNet revenues for our Diagnostics segment may be impacted by our reliance upon large customers in North America, seasonal factors and sporadic outbreaks, and changing diagnostic market conditions.\n\u2022\nNet revenues for our Life Science segment may be impacted by customer concentrations and buying patterns.\n\u2022\nIntense competition could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.\n\u2022\nWe expect to continue facing increased competition resulting from the expiration of our H. pylori patents.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to protect or obtain adequate patent protection for intellectual property that we utilize or intend to utilize.\n\u2022\nProduct infringement claims by other companies could result in costly disputes and could limit our ability to sell our products.\nRisks Related to our Operations\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to develop new products or acquire products on favorable terms.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate operations or to achieve expected cost savings from acquisitions we make.\n\u2022\nThe effective tax rate of the Company may be negatively impacted by changes in the mix of earnings as well as future changes to tax laws in global jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\u2022\nSignificant interruptions in production at our principal manufacturing facilities and/or third-party manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\u2022\nWe depend on sole-source suppliers for certain critical raw materials, components and finished products. A supply interruption could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nOur ability to meet future customer demand for selected products is dependent upon our ability to successfully manage our manufacturing capacity and supply chains.\n\u2022\nIncreased prices for, poor quality of, or extended inability to source raw materials or services used in our products, and supply chain disruptions, could adversely affect profitability.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and International Matters\n\u2022\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation, and our ability to earn profits may be restricted by these regulations.\n\u2022\nIf we or our third-party vendors fail to comply with FDA regulations relating to the manufacturing of our products or any component part, we may be subject to fines, injunctions and penalties, and our ability to commercially distribute and sell our products may be negatively impacted.\n- 12 -\n\u2022\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies in the U.S., and failure to comply with these laws could harm our business and the price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nWe could be adversely affected by health care reform legislation.\n\u2022\nEfforts to reduce the U.S. federal deficit could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022\nGlobal market, political, environmental, and economic conditions, including those related to the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\u2022\nWe depend on international net revenues, and our operating results may be adversely impacted by foreign currency, regulatory or other developments affecting international markets.\n\u2022\nNew tariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may have to limit or cease sales of our products.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders and subject us to litigation.\n\u2022\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism, an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest.\n\u2022\nThe authority of our board to issue preferred stock and the effects of certain provisions of Ohio corporation law may discourage takeover bids.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022\nOne or more cybersecurity incidents may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and/or reputation.\n\u2022\nOur business could be negatively affected if we are unable to attract, hire and retain key personnel.\n\u2022\nOur bank credit agreement imposes restrictions with respect to our operations, which could adversely impact our business.\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\nIf the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement does not occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nOn July 7, 2022, we entered into the Merger Agreement noted above within the \u201cPending Merger\u201d section of Item 1. \u201cBusiness.\u201d Completion of the proposed Merger is subject to the satisfaction of various conditions. There is no assurance that all of the various conditions will be satisfied, or that the Merger will be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all. The proposed Merger gives rise to inherent risks that include:\n\u2022\nthe amount of the cash to be paid under the Merger Agreement is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operations or in the event of any change in the market price of, analyst estimates of, or projections relating to, our common stock;\n\u2022\nlegal or regulatory proceedings, or other matters that affect the timing or ability to complete the transaction as contemplated;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of disruption to our business, including increased costs and diversion of management time and resources;\n\u2022\ndifficulties maintaining business and operational relationships, including relationships with clients, vendors, suppliers, distributors, resellers and other business partners;\n\u2022\nthe inability to attract and retain key personnel pending consummation of the proposed Merger;\n- 13 -\n\u2022\npotential stockholder litigation relating to the Merger could prevent or delay the Merger or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations;\n\u2022\nthe inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make changes to our business pending the completion of the proposed Merger;\n\u2022\ndevelopments beyond our control including, but not limited to, changes in domestic or global economic conditions that may affect the timing or success of the proposed Merger; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that if the proposed Merger is not completed, the market price of our common stock could decline, investor confidence could decline, stockholder litigation could be brought against us, relationships with clients, suppliers and other business partners may be adversely impacted, we may be unable to retain key personnel, and profitability may be adversely impacted due to costs incurred in connection with the proposed Merger and general disruption to our business.\nOur financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by outbreaks of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny outbreak of contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, or other adverse public health developments, could have material and adverse effects on our business operations. Such adverse effects could include diversion or prioritization of health care resources away from the conduct of diagnostic testing, disruptions of or restrictions on the ability of laboratories to process our tests, and delays or difficulties with respect to patients accessing our tests, including those resulting from an inability to travel as a result of quarantines or other restrictions resulting from such outbreaks. As COVID-19 continues to affect individuals and businesses around the globe, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, including:\n\u2022\ndecreased volume of testing and related sales of certain of our Diagnostics segment products as a result of disruptions to health care providers and limitations on the ability of providers to administer tests;\n\u2022\ndisruptions or restrictions on the ability of the Company\u2019s, our collaborators\u2019, or our suppliers\u2019 personnel to travel, and temporary closures of our facilities, or the facilities of our collaborators or suppliers;\n\u2022\nlimitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the development of our products, the processing of our diagnostic tests, and/or the conduct of our clinical trials, because of illness of employees or their families, or requirements imposed on employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; and\n\u2022\ndelays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees, and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees.\nIn addition, the continued spread of COVID-19 globally could adversely affect our manufacturing and supply chains. Parts of our direct and indirect supply chains are located overseas, including in China, and may accordingly be subject to disruption. Additionally, our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that COVID-19 or any other epidemic harms our business or the economy in general either domestically or in any other region in which we do business. The extent to which COVID-19 affects our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have generally seen a slowing of our assay instrument placements and sales of related test kits, as diagnostic testing sites turned their attention to critical care testing. We are unable to predict when expected sales volume levels for our instruments and related test kits will return. Also, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain clinical trials related to our products which were underway or scheduled to begin were temporarily placed on hold. Such delays have impacted our timing for filing applications for product clearances with the FDA, as well as related timing of FDA clearances of such filings. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic slowed efforts to expand our product portfolio through acquisition opportunities, impacting the speed with which we are able to bring additional products to market.\n- 14 -\nNet revenues for our Diagnostics segment may be impacted by our reliance upon large customers in North America, seasonal factors and sporadic outbreaks, and changing diagnostic market conditions.\nKey Distributors\nOur Diagnostics segment\u2019s net revenues from sales through three customers, including two key distributors, were approximately 29%, 33% and 32% of the Diagnostics segment\u2019s total net revenues for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, or approximately 13%, 13% and 15%, respectively, of each year\u2019s consolidated net revenues. The loss of any one of these customers could negatively impact our net revenues and results of operations unless suitable alternatives were timely found or in the case of distributor customers, lost sales to one distributor were absorbed by another distributor. Finding a suitable alternative on satisfactory terms may pose challenges in our industry\u2019s competitive environment. As an alternative, we could expand our efforts to distribute and market our products directly. This alternative, however, would require substantial investment in additional sales, marketing and logistics resources, including hiring additional sales and customer service personnel, which would significantly increase our future selling, general and administrative expenses.\nIn addition, buying patterns of these customers may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, potentially leading to uneven concentration levels on a quarterly basis.\nSeasonal Factors and Sporadic Outbreaks\nOur principal business is the sale of a broad range of diagnostic test kits for common gastrointestinal and respiratory infectious diseases, and elevated blood lead levels. Certain infectious diseases may be seasonal in nature, while others may be associated with sporadic outbreaks, such as foodborne illnesses or pandemics such as an influenza outbreak or the COVID-19 pandemic. While we believe that the breadth of our Diagnostics segment product lines normally reduces the risk that infections subject to seasonality and sporadic outbreaks will cause significant variability in Diagnostics segment net revenues, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on our Diagnostics segment net revenues since it began in fiscal 2020. Accordingly, we can make no assurance that net revenues will not be negatively impacted period over period by such factors.\nChanging Diagnostic Market Conditions\nChanges in the U.S. health care delivery system have resulted in consolidation among reference laboratories, hospital laboratories being operated by large reference laboratories, and the formation of multi-hospital alliances, reducing the number of institutional customers for diagnostic test products. Consolidation in the U.S. health care industry has also led to the creation of GPOs and IDNs that aggregate buying power for hospital groups and put pressure on our selling prices. Due to such consolidation, we may not be able to enter into and/or sustain contractual or other marketing or distribution arrangements on a satisfactory commercial basis with institutional customers, GPOs and/or IDNs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nNet revenues for our Life Science segment may be impacted by customer concentrations and buying patterns.\nOur Life Science segment\u2019s net revenues from three diagnostic manufacturing customers were 31%, 20% and 24% of the Life Science segment\u2019s total net revenues for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales to these three diagnostic manufacturing customers comprised 17%, 12% and 13% of consolidated net revenues for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, in excess of 10% of the Life Science segment\u2019s total net revenues has historically been concentrated among a number of other significant customers. Any significant alteration of buying patterns from these customers resulting from the decline in COVID-19 related demand, or otherwise, could adversely affect our period over period net revenues and results of operations.\nIntense competition could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by substantial competition and rapid change. Hundreds of companies around the world supply diagnostic tests and immunoassay and molecular reagents. These companies range from multinational health care entities, for which diagnostics is one line of business, to small start-up companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. We cannot provide assurance that our products and services will be able to compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors.\n- 15 -\nWe expect to continue facing increased competition resulting from the expiration of our H. pylori patents.\nThe patents for our stool antigen H. pylori products, owned by us, expired in May 2016 in the U.S. and in May 2017 in countries outside the U.S. As a result, competition with respect to our stool antigen H. pylori products, products which currently represent approximately 5% of our total net revenues has increased, adversely impacting our selling prices for these products, and/or our ability to retain business at prices acceptable to us. To mitigate certain of the pricing and volume pressures we face within the gastrointestinal product category, we have: (i) operated under a strategic collaboration agreement with DiaSorin to sell H. pylori tests; (ii) adjusted selling prices to secure volume; and (iii) upon FDA clearance in March 2020, launched Curian HpSA, our first assay on the Curian platform, which we expect will help protect our existing customer base using lateral flow tests. We also expect the BreathID and BreathTek products to mitigate competitive pressures, as these systems provide an alternative to stool antigen testing. We are unable to provide assurances that we will be successful with any strategy or that any strategy will prevent an adverse effect on our future results of operations and liquidity, including net revenues and gross profit.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may be unable to protect or obtain adequate patent protection for intellectual property that we utilize or intend to utilize.\nIn developing and manufacturing our products, we employ a variety of proprietary and patented technologies. In addition, we have licensed, and expect to continue to license, various complementary technologies and methods from academic institutions and public and private companies. We cannot provide assurance that the technologies that we own or license provide protection from competitive threats or from challenges to our intellectual property. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that we will be successful in obtaining and retaining licenses, or proprietary or patented technologies, in the future.\nProduct infringement claims by other companies could result in costly disputes and could limit our ability to sell our products.\nLitigation over intellectual property rights is prevalent in the life science and diagnostic industries. As the market for diagnostics continues to grow and the number of participants in the market increases, we may increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims. It is possible that a third party may claim infringement against us. If found to infringe, we may attempt to obtain a license to such intellectual property; however, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, if our products are found to infringe on third-party intellectual property, we may be required to pay damages for past infringement and lose the ability to sell certain products, causing our revenues to decrease. Any substantial loss resulting from such a claim could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, and the damage to our reputation in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and liquidity, including net revenues and gross profit.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe may be unable to develop new products or acquire products on favorable terms.\nThe medical diagnostic and life science industries are characterized by ongoing technological developments and changing customer requirements. As such, our results of operations and continued growth depend, in part, on our ability in a timely manner to develop or acquire rights to, and successfully introduce into the marketplace, enhancements of existing products and services, or new products and services that incorporate technological advances, meet customer requirements, and/or respond to products developed by our competition. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in developing or acquiring such rights to products and services on a timely basis, or that such products and services will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, we must regularly allocate considerable resources to research and development of new or acquired products, services and technologies, and protecting intellectual property. The research and development process generally takes a significant amount of time from research to product launch. This process is conducted in various stages. During each stage, there is a risk that we will not achieve our goals on a timely basis, or at all, and we may have to abandon a project in which we have invested substantial resources, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n- 16 -\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate operations or to achieve expected cost savings from acquisitions we make.\nOne of our growth strategies is the acquisition of companies and/or products. Although additional acquisitions of companies and products may enhance the opportunity to increase net earnings over time, such acquisitions could result in greater administrative burdens, increased exposure to the uncertainties inherent in marketing new products, financial risks of additional operating costs, disrupted operations, challenges in employee retention, and increased risk of asset impairments if future net revenues and cash flows are deficient. The principal benefits expected to result from any acquisitions we make will not be achieved fully unless we are able to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired entities with our operations and realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating these businesses into our existing businesses. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify and complete additional acquisitions on terms we consider favorable or that, if completed, will be successfully integrated into our operations. Furthermore, we cannot predict the outcome of goodwill impairment testing and the impact of goodwill impairments on the Company\u2019s net earnings and results of operations.\nThe effective tax rate of the Company may be negatively impacted by changes in the mix of earnings as well as future changes to tax laws in global jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various other global jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Recently, the current U.S. presidential administration committed to tax reform, and if enacted, the impact could be material to our tax provision and value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, or if there is a change to the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could result in a material increase in our effective tax rate.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could have a material impact on our effective tax rate. Many countries in the EU, as well as several other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. Certain proposals could include recommendations that could increase our tax obligations in those countries where we do business. Any changes in the taxation of our activities in such jurisdictions may result in a material increase in our effective tax rate.\nSignificant interruptions in production at our principal manufacturing facilities and/or third-party manufacturing facilities would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nProducts and services manufactured at facilities we own or lease comprise a majority of our net revenues. Our global supply of these products and services is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. In addition, we currently rely on a small number of third-party manufacturers to produce certain of our diagnostic products and product components. The operations of our facilities or these third-party manufacturing facilities could be adversely affected by power failures, or natural or other disasters such as earthquakes, floods, tornadoes or terrorist threats. Although we carry insurance to protect against certain business interruptions at our facilities, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. Any significant interruption in the Company\u2019s or a third-party supplier\u2019s manufacturing capabilities, including interruptions resulting from product recall activities like that experienced in our Billerica facility (see \u201cLead Testing Matters\u201d beginning on page 32 within MD&A) could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\n- 17 -\nWe depend on sole-source suppliers for certain critical raw materials, components and finished products. A supply interruption could adversely affect our business.\nRaw Materials and Components\nOur diagnostic products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are biological or chemical in nature, and that generally are available from multiple sources of supply. We sole-source certain raw materials and components, which makes it time consuming and costly to switch raw materials and components in FDA-cleared products. If certain suppliers fail to supply required raw materials or components, we will need to secure other sources which may require us to conduct additional development and testing and obtain regulatory approval. These activities require significant time and resources, and there is no assurance that new sources will be secured or regulatory approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.\nWe utilize third-party manufacturers for certain of our instrumentation. One third party manufactures our proprietary Alethia Incubator/Reader (instrument), a component of our Alethia molecular system, and an additional third party manufactures our Curian instrument. These instruments are manufactured exclusively for Meridian according to our specifications. While other manufacturers for these types of instruments are available, we source each instrument solely from one manufacturer to limit the costs involved in clearing the system for marketing in the U.S. If these third-party manufacturers fail to supply us with instruments, we will need to secure another manufacturer, and it may take as long as 12 months to transfer instrument manufacturing. An interruption in the manufacturing of these instruments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, one third party manufactures a certain reagent for use with our Alethia assays. While alternative suppliers exist, we elect to utilize this third party exclusively in order to maintain consistency in our materials, which is critical in complying with FDA regulatory requirements. An interruption in the manufacturing of these reagents could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFinished Products\nWe outsource the manufacturing for certain finished diagnostic products to third parties. A disruption in the supply of these finished products could have a material adverse effect on our business until we find another supplier or bring manufacturing in-house.\nActivities undertaken by Meridian to reduce the risk of these sole-supplier arrangements include maintaining adequate inventory levels, supplier qualification procedures, supplier audits, site visits, and frequent communication. Additionally, we have identified potential alternate suppliers.\nOur ability to meet future customer demand for selected products is dependent upon our ability to successfully manage our manufacturing capacity and supply chains.\nTo manage our anticipated future growth effectively, it may become necessary for us to enhance our manufacturing and supply chain capabilities, infrastructure and operations, information technology infrastructure, and financial and accounting systems and controls. Organizational growth and scale-up of operations could strain our existing managerial, operational, financial, and other resources. If our management is unable to effectively prepare for our expected future growth, our expenses may increase more than anticipated, our net revenues could grow more slowly than expected, and we may not be able to achieve our commercialization, profitability, or product development goals. Our failure to effectively implement the necessary processes and procedures and otherwise prepare for our anticipated growth could have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Russia / Ukraine war (the \u201cWar\u201d) that developed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 also could disrupt our supply chains. While to date this War has not caused us to experience any material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, we are unable to estimate the extent to which, if at all, the war could hurt our supply chains. The evolving nature of the War, related international sanctions, other potential government actions, and economic consequences of the War, including incurring higher costs to source materials due to inflation or otherwise, are factors that could disrupt supply chains throughout the world, including potentially the supply chains on which our business relies. If the War either directly or indirectly disrupts our supply chains and we are unable to mitigate such disruption, the War could have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\n- 18 -\nIncreased prices for, poor quality of, or extended inability to source raw materials or services used in our products, and supply chain disruptions, could adversely affect profitability.\nOur profitability is affected by the prices of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. These prices fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, fuel-related delivery costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates, and, in some cases, government regulation. Significant increases in the prices of raw materials, services and transportation costs, similar to the inflationary increases we have experienced since the second half of fiscal 2021, that cannot be recovered through increases in the price of our products and/or offset by savings in other areas, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot guarantee that the prices we are paying for raw materials today will continue in the future, or that the marketplace will continue to support current prices for our products, or that such prices can be adjusted to fully or partially offset raw material price increases in the future. Any increases in prices resulting from a tightening supply of these or other commodities could adversely affect our profitability. We do not engage in hedging transactions for raw material purchases, but we do enter into some fixed-price supply contracts.\nOur dependency upon regular deliveries of supplies and the quality of those supplies upon delivery from particular suppliers means that interruptions, stoppages, or deterioration of quality in such deliveries could adversely affect our operations until arrangements with alternate suppliers could be made. Several of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products currently are procured from a single source. In some cases, we also outsource certain services to suppliers, including but not limited to, engineering, assembly, shipping, and commissioning services. If a supplier were unable to deliver these materials or services, or if the quality of these materials or services declined, for an extended period of time as a result of financial difficulties, catastrophic events affecting their facilities, or other factors, including recent supply chain disruptions we have experienced, or if we were unable to negotiate acceptable terms for the supply of materials or services with these suppliers, our business could be adversely affected. We may not be able to find acceptable alternatives, and any such alternatives could result in increased costs. Extended inability to source a necessary raw material or service could cause us to cease manufacturing one or more products for a period of time, which could also lead to loss of customers, as well as reputational, competitive, or business harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and International Matters\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation, and our ability to earn profits may be restricted by these regulations.\nMedical device diagnostics is a highly regulated industry. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary governmental clearances or approvals, or timely clearances or approvals, to market future products in the U.S. and other countries. Costs and difficulties in complying with laws and regulations administered by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d), or other regulators can result in unanticipated expenses and delays, and interruptions to the sale of new and existing products.\nRegulatory approval can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, making the timing and cost of approvals difficult to predict. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in delays in obtaining authorization to sell products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of authority to manufacture or sell products, and other civil or criminal sanctions.\n- 19 -\nIf we or our third-party vendors fail to comply with FDA regulations relating to the manufacturing of our products or any component part, we may be subject to fines, injunctions and penalties, and our ability to commercially distribute and sell our products may be negatively impacted.\nOur diagnostics manufacturing facilities, and the manufacturing facilities of any of our third-party diagnostic component manufacturers or critical suppliers, are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d), which sets forth minimum standards for the procedures, execution and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, and shipping of the products we sell, and related regulations, including Medical Device Reporting (\u201cMDR\u201d) regulations regarding reporting of certain malfunctions and adverse events potentially associated with our products. The FDA may evaluate our compliance with the QSR, MDR and other regulations, among other ways, through periodic announced or unannounced inspections which could disrupt our operations and interrupt our manufacturing. If in conducting an inspection of our manufacturing facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of any of our third-party component manufacturers or critical suppliers, an FDA investigator observes conditions or practices believed to violate the QSR, the investigator may document their observations on a Form FDA 483 that is issued at the conclusion of the inspection. A manufacturer that receives an FDA 483 may respond in writing and explain any corrective actions taken in response to the inspectional observations. The FDA will typically review the facility\u2019s written response and may re-inspect to determine the facility\u2019s compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulatory requirements. Failure to take adequate and timely corrective actions to remedy objectionable conditions listed on an FDA 483 could result in the FDA taking administrative or enforcement actions. Among these may be the FDA\u2019s issuance of a Warning Letter to a manufacturer, which informs it that the FDA considers the observed violations to be of \u201cregulatory significance\u201d that, if not corrected, could result in further enforcement action.\nFDA enforcement actions, which include seizure, injunction, criminal prosecution, and civil penalties, could result in total or partial suspension of a facility\u2019s production and/or distribution, product recalls, fines, suspension of the FDA\u2019s review of product applications, and/or the FDA\u2019s issuance of adverse publicity. Thus, an adverse inspection could force a shutdown of our manufacturing operations or a recall of our products. Adverse inspections could also delay FDA approval of our products and could have an adverse effect on our production, net revenues and profitability.\nWe and any of our third-party vendors may also encounter other problems during manufacturing including failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, and environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede our ability to meet demand. The manufacture of our product also subjects us to risks that could harm our business, including problems relating to our facilities and errors in manufacturing components that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of our products or cause delays in shipment of our products. Any interruption or delay in the manufacture of the product, or any of its components, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive products, which could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nAs described in Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d, on April 17, 2018, the Company\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary Magellan received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) regarding its LeadCare product line. The subpoena outlined documents to be produced, and the Company is cooperating with the DOJ in this matter. The Company maintains rigorous policies and procedures to promote compliance with applicable regulatory agencies and requirements and is working with the DOJ to promptly respond to the subpoena, including responding to additional information requests that have followed receipt of the subpoena in April 2018. The Company has executed tolling agreements to extend the statute of limitations. In March and April 2021, DOJ issued two subpoenas, both to former employees of Magellan, calling for witnesses to testify before a federal grand jury related to this matter. In September and October 2021, DOJ issued additional subpoenas to individuals seeking testimony and documents in connection with its ongoing investigation. It is the Company\u2019s understanding that multiple witnesses have testified before the federal grand jury and the DOJ\u2019s investigation is ongoing. Discussions continue with the DOJ to explore resolution of the matter. As of September 30, 2022, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company believes a loss is probable in the DOJ LeadCare legal matter and has accrued $10,000 as an estimate of the cost to resolve the DOJ LeadCare legal matter, which is reflected in litigation and select legal costs within the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2022. The Company cannot predict when the investigation will be resolved or the outcome of the investigation, and the ultimate resolution of the DOJ LeadCare legal matter may exceed the amount accrued at September 30, 2022 and could be material to the Company. Expense for attorneys\u2019 fees related to this matter totaling $3,510, $2,803 and $2,035 is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n- 20 -\nMagellan submitted 510(k) applications in December 2018, seeking to reinstate venous blood sample-types for its LeadCare II, LeadCare Plus and LeadCare Ultra testing systems. In the second fiscal quarter of 2019, the FDA informed Magellan that each of these 510(k) applications had been put on Additional Information hold. On July 15, 2019, we provided responses to the FDA\u2019s requests for Additional Information. These 510(k) applications have since expired and are no longer under FDA review. Further, while Magellan\u2019s LeadCare testing systems remain cleared for marketing by the FDA and permitted for use with capillary blood samples, the FDA advised that it has commissioned a third-party study of the Company\u2019s LeadCare testing systems using both venous and capillary blood samples. According to the FDA, the results of the field study will be used in conjunction with other information to determine whether further action by the FDA or the CDC is necessary to protect the public health. The Company intends to fully cooperate with the FDA or CDC on any follow-up based on the third-party study.\nDuring October 2019, the FDA performed a follow-up inspection of Magellan\u2019s manufacturing facility. The FDA issued five Form FDA 483 observations. On March 18, 2020, we participated in a regulatory meeting with the FDA at the FDA\u2019s request to further discuss the Form FDA 483 observations and our remediation efforts. Since the inspection, we have submitted a number of written responses to the FDA regarding the five Form FDA 483 observations issued in the October 2019 inspection, and have worked diligently to execute a remediation plan. During October 2020, the FDA issued Establishment Inspection Reports which closed out the inspections from June 2017 and October 2019 under 21 C.F.R.20.64(d)(3).\nDuring June 2021, the FDA performed an inspection of Magellan\u2019s manufacturing facility. As a result of this inspection, the FDA issued one Form 483 observation. On August 3, 2021, FDA sent Magellan a close-out letter for the Warning Letter that FDA issued to Magellan on October 23, 2017. The FDA\u2019s close-out letter notified Magellan that FDA has completed an evaluation of Magellan\u2019s corrective actions in response to FDA\u2019s Warning Letter, and based on FDA\u2019s evaluation, Magellan has addressed the issues identified in the Warning Letter. FDA\u2019s close-out letter also stated that future FDA inspections of Magellan and regulatory activities will further assess the adequacy and sustainability of Magellan\u2019s corrections.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies in the U.S., and failure to comply with these laws could harm our business and the price of our common stock.\nAs a public company listed in the U.S., we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and the NASDAQ Global Select Market, may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and/or make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we fail to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed.\nWe could be adversely affected by health care reform legislation.\nThird-party payers for medical products and services, including state, federal and foreign governments, are increasingly concerned about escalating health care costs and can indirectly affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement they will provide for diagnostic testing services. Following years of increasing pressure, during 2010 the U.S. government enacted comprehensive health care reform with the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which made changes that significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 requires applicable laboratories to report all private payor reimbursement rates and the volumes for each test they perform. The statute requires that Medicare establish reimbursement rates based on the weighted median of private insurance reimbursement rates effective January 1, 2017. The new Medicare rates would be subject to a maximum reduction of 10% a year for the initial three-year period and a maximum of 15% a year for the subsequent three-year period. There is no limit on the amount of potential rate increases. As a result, some of our customers in the U.S. may experience lower Medicare reimbursement rates for our products, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are seeing some effect on the reimbursement rates for our products. If reimbursement amounts for diagnostic testing services decrease further in the future, such decreases may reduce the amount that will be reimbursed to hospitals or physicians for such services and consequently, could place constraints on the levels of overall pricing, which could have a material effect on our net revenues and results of operations.\n- 21 -\nAdditional state and federal health care reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our products and on our industry in general. For example, the U.S. government has in the past considered, is currently considering, and may in the future consider, health care policies and proposals intended to curb rising health care costs, including those that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for health care services. Further, state and local governments, as well as a number of foreign governments, are also considering or have adopted similar types of policies. Future significant changes in the health care system in the U.S. or elsewhere, and current uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. We are unable to predict whether health care policies, including policies stemming from legislation or regulations affecting our business, may be proposed or enacted in the future, what effect such policies would have on our business, or the effect that ongoing uncertainty about these matters will have on the purchasing decisions of our customers.\nEfforts to reduce the U.S. federal deficit could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny reductions in government health care spending or research funding in an effort to reduce the U.S. federal deficit could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. Further, there is ongoing uncertainty regarding the federal budget and federal spending levels, including the possible impacts of a failure to increase the \u201cdebt ceiling.\u201d Any U.S. government default on its debt could have broad macroeconomic effects that could, among other things, raise our borrowing costs. Any future shutdown of the federal government or failure to enact annual appropriations could also have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, and results of operations.\nGlobal market, political, environmental, and economic conditions, including those related to the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in general economic, political and environmental conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Conditions such as the following, among others, may create additional risk to our results of operations: (i) continuing uncertainties in the eurozone; (ii) the effects of climate change regulation; (iii) the global effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the Emergency Temporary Standard (\u201cETS\u201d) COVID-19 workplace vaccination and testing mandate from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d); (iv) unanticipated implications from the voluntary exit of the U.K. from the EU; and (v) uncertainties in China and emerging markets.\nInstability in the global economy and financial markets can adversely affect our business in several ways, including limiting our customers\u2019 ability to obtain sufficient credit or pay for our products within the terms of sale. Competition could further intensify among the manufacturers and distributors with whom we compete for volume and market share, resulting in lower net revenue due to steeper discounts and product mix-down. In particular, if certain key or sole suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies.\nThe U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020. While all EU rules and laws continued to apply to the U.K. through the transition period, which ended December 31, 2020, the U.K. and the EU reached a free trade agreement on December 24, 2020, which was ratified on April 28, 2021 and went into effect on May 1, 2021. The agreement includes regulatory and customs cooperation mechanisms, as well as provisions supporting open and fair competition. Under the trade agreement, the U.K. is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate with other countries that do not currently have free trade deals with the EU. Although the full impact of the trade agreement is uncertain, it is possible that the recent changes to the trading relationship between the U.K. and the EU due to the trade agreement could result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the U.K., which may decrease the profitability of our operations. Additional currency volatility could drive a weaker British pound, which could increase the cost of goods imported into the U.K. and may decrease the profitability of our operations. A weaker British pound versus the U.S. dollar may also cause local currency results of our operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars during a reporting period. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the trade agreement will have on our business; however, Brexit and its related effects could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, and results of operations.\n- 22 -\nWe depend on international net revenues, and our operating results may be adversely impacted by foreign currency, regulatory or other developments affecting international markets.\nWe sell products and services into approximately 70 countries. For fiscal 2022, approximately one-third of our consolidated net revenues were transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates for the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, and New Israeli shekel. In addition, we have manufacturing operations, suppliers, and employees located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S., we expect to continue to increase our revenue and presence outside the U.S., including in emerging markets.\nOur international business is subject to risks that are often encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:\n\u2022\ninterruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers, including conditions where recovery from natural disasters may be delayed due to country-specific infrastructure and resources;\n\u2022\ndifferences in terms of sale, including payment terms;\n\u2022\nlocal product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic condition, including with respect to safety and health issues;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including unfavorable changes with respect to tax, trade or sanctions compliance matters;\n\u2022\nlimitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contract and property rights under local law;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and\n\u2022\ndiffering protection of intellectual property.\nSuch risks may be more likely or pronounced in emerging markets, where our operations may be subject to greater uncertainty due to increased volatility associated with the developing nature of their economic, legal, and governmental systems.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations, it could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, or results of operations.\nNew tariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe current U.S. administration has expressed strong concerns about imports from countries that it perceives as engaging in unfair trade practices, and it is possible the administration could impose import duties or other restrictions on products, components or raw materials sourced from those countries, which may include countries from which we import components or raw materials. We are currently not aware of any new import duties imposed on our products. Any such new import duties or restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, these new tariffs, or other changes in U.S. trade policy, could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries. Certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods.\nOther foreign governments are considering the imposition of sanctions that will deny U.S. companies access to critical raw materials. A \u201ctrade war\u201d of this nature or other governmental actions related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, manufacturers, suppliers and/or the economic environments in which we operate and, thus may adversely impact our businesses. In addition, there may be changes to existing trade agreements, like the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and its anticipated successor agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d), which is still subject to approval by the U.S., Mexico and Canada, greater restrictions on free trade generally, and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly tariffs on products manufactured in Mexico, among other possible changes. It remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs, NAFTA, USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. Any changes to NAFTA (or subsequent trade agreements) could impact our operations in countries where we manufacture or sell products, or source components or materials, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n- 23 -\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may have to limit or cease sales of our products.\nThe testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical diagnostic products involves an inherent risk of product liability claims. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or cease sales of our products. We currently carry product liability insurance at a level we believe is commercially reasonable, although there is no assurance that it will be adequate to cover claims that may arise. In certain customer contracts, we indemnify third parties for certain product liability claims related to our products. These indemnification obligations may cause us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications. In addition, a defect in the design or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability for injury and otherwise. Any substantial underinsured loss resulting from such a claim could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, and the damage to our reputation in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders and subject us to litigation.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to numerous factors, including but not limited to the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. In addition, the stock market in general, the NASDAQ Global Market and the market for diagnostics companies in particular may experience a loss of investor confidence. A loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class-action litigation. Class-action litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could further materially harm our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism, an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest.\nIn recent years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies. If a proxy contest or an unsolicited takeover proposal is made with respect to us, we could incur significant costs in defending our company, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results. Shareholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of our company. Such proposals may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nThe authority of our board to issue preferred stock and the effects of certain provisions of Ohio corporation law may discourage takeover bids.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to one million shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of such shares without any future vote or action by the shareholders. The issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. Ohio corporation law contains provisions that may discourage takeover bids for our company that have not been negotiated with the board of directors. Such provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, sales of substantial amounts of shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital at a price favorable to us.\n- 24 -\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOne or more cybersecurity incidents may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nOur operations involve the use of multiple systems that process, store and transmit sensitive information about our customers, suppliers, employees, financial position, operating results and strategies. We face global cybersecurity risks and threats on a continual and ongoing basis, which include, but are not limited to, attempts to access systems and information, computer viruses, or denial-of-service attacks. These risks and threats range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures. While we are not aware of any material cyber-attacks or breaches of our systems to date, we have and continue to implement measures to safeguard our systems and information and mitigate potential risks, including employee training around phishing, malware and other cyber risks, but there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems, compromise sensitive information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such events, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact our reputation and our competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business due to disruption of operations and/or reputational damage, potential liability and increased remediation and protection costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In an effort to mitigate the financial impact such an attack might have on the Company, we maintain cyber liability insurance coverage. However, such coverage may be insufficient to cover the full impact of a cyber-attack. Additionally, as cybersecurity risks become more sophisticated, we may need to increase our investments in security measures which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively affected if we are unable to attract, hire and retain key personnel.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain highly qualified personnel, including our executive officers and scientific, technical, sales and marketing employees, and their ability to manage growth successfully. If such key employees were to leave and we were unable to obtain adequate replacements, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur bank credit agreement imposes restrictions with respect to our operations, which could adversely impact our business.\nOur bank credit agreement contains a number of financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and tests. If we fail to comply with the obligations in the credit agreement, we would be in default under the credit agreement. If an event of default is not cured or waived, it could result in acceleration of any indebtedness under our credit agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. At September 30, 2022, we had $25,000 outstanding on a $200,000 bank revolving credit facility.", "PERMNO": 10530, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "VIVO"}
